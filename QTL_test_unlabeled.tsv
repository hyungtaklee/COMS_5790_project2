34902587	Detection of porcine circovirus type 3 DNA in serum and semen samples of boars from a German boar stud.	Porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) is regularly reported in association with various clinical presentations, including porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS)-like lesions, respiratory signs, congenital tremor, and reproductive disorders. To investigate the epidemiology of PCV3 in a boar stud, we analysed fresh boar semen and matching sera from 181 boars from a German stud  supplying semen for artificial insemination (AI) to approximately 740 breeder farms for PCV3 DNA. PCV3 DNA was detected in 1.7% semen samples and 24.3% sera. Spearman rho correlation demonstrated a significant positive correlation between  boar age and quantitative DNA (by PCR quantification cycles [Cq] values) in serum samples (r = 0.636; P < 0.001). Sera from boars up to 12 months of age had higher viral loads (P < 0.001) and were PCV3-positive significantly more often (P < 0.01) than older boars. Detection of PCV3 DNA was not associated with breed (P> 0.05). PCV3 DNA was detected sporadically in fresh boar semen. Based on the assumption that processing fresh semen reduces viral load in semen used for AI, it is likely that the risk of sexual transmission of PCV3 during AI in is low. However, young boars may contribute to the maintenance of PCV3 infection in boar  studs.	0
35451025	Imputation of non-genotyped F1 dams to improve genetic gain in swine crossbreeding programs.	This study investigated using imputed genotypes from non-genotyped animals which  were not in the pedigree for the purpose of genetic selection and improving genetic gain for economically relevant traits. Simulations were used to mimic a 3-breed crossbreeding system that resembled a modern swine breeding scheme. The simulation consisted of three purebred (PB) breeds A, B and C each with 25 and 425 mating males and females, respectively. Males from A and females from B were  crossed to produce AB females (n=1,000), which were crossed with males from C to  produce crossbreds (CB; n=10,000). The genome consisted of three chromosomes with 300 quantitative trait loci and ~9,000 markers. Lowly heritable reproductive traits were simulated for A, B and AB (h 2=0.2, 0.2 and 0.15, respectively), while a moderately heritable carcass trait was simulated for C (h 2=0.4). Genetic correlations between reproductive traits in A, B and AB were moderate (rg=0.65).  The goal trait of the breeding program was AB performance. Selection was practiced for four generations where AB and CB animals were first produced in generations 1 and 2, respectively. Non-genotyped AB dams were imputed using FImpute beginning in generation 2. Genotypes of PB and CB were used for imputation. Imputation strategies differed by three factors; 1) AB progeny genotyped per generation (2, 3, 4 or 6), 2) known or unknown mates of AB dams and 3) genotyping rate of females from breeds A and B (0 or 100%). PB selection candidates from A and B were selected using estimated breeding values for AB performance, while candidates from C were selected by phenotype. Response to selection using imputed genotypes of non-genotyped animals was then compared to the scenarios where true AB genotypes (trueGeno) or no AB genotypes/phenotypes (noGeno) were used in genetic evaluations. The simulation was replicated 20 times. The average increase in genotype concordance between unknown and known sire imputation strategies was 0.22. Genotype concordance increased as the number of genotyped CB increased with little additional gain beyond 9 progeny. When mates of AB were known and more than 4 progeny were genotyped per generation, the phenotypic response in AB did not differ (P>0.05) from trueGeno yet was greater (P<0.05) than noGeno. Imputed genotypes of non-genotyped animals can be used to increase performance when 4 or more progeny are genotyped and sire pedigrees of CB animals are known.	0
34859764	Proposed multidimensional pain outcome methodology to demonstrate analgesic drug  efficacy and facilitate future drug approval for piglet castration.	Castration of male piglets in the United States is conducted without analgesics because no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved products are labeled for pain control in swine. The absence of approved products is primarily due to a wide variation in how pain is measured in suckling piglets and the lack of validated pain-specific outcomes individually indistinct from other biological responses, such as general stress or inflammation responses with cortisol. Simply put, to measure pain mitigation, measurement of pain must be specific, quantifiable, and defined. Therefore, given the need for mitigating castration pain, a consortium of researchers, veterinarians, industry, and regulatory agencies was formed to identify potential animal-based outcomes and develop a methodology, based on the known scientific research, to measure pain and the efficacy of mitigation strategies. The outcome-based measures included physiological, neuroendocrine, behavioral, and production parameters. Ultimately, this consortium aims to provide a validated multimodal methodology to demonstrate analgesic drug efficacy for piglet castration.Measurable outcomes were selected based on published studies suggesting their validity, reliability, and sensitivity for the direct or indirect measurement of pain associated with surgical castration in piglets. Outcomes to be considered are observation of pain behaviors (i.e. ethogram defined behaviors and piglet grimace scale), gait parameters measured with a pressure mat, infrared thermography of skin temperature of the cranium and periphery of the eye, and blood biomarkers. Other  measures include body weight and mortality rate.This standardized measurement of  the outcome variable's primary goal is to facilitate consistency and rigor by developing a research methodology utilizing endpoints that are well-defined and reliably measure pain in piglets. The resulting methodology will facilitate and guide the evaluation of the effectiveness of comprehensive analgesic interventions for 3- to 5-day-old piglets following surgical castration.	0
35143972	Nanostructured lipid carriers loaded with an association of minoxidil and latanoprost for targeted topical therapy of alopecia.	Alopecia is a condition associated with different etiologies, ranging from hormonal changes to chemotherapy, that affects over 80 million people in the USA. Nevertheless, there are currently few FDA-approved drugs for topical treatment, and existing formulations still present skin irritation issues, compromising treatment adherence. This work aimed to develop a safe formulation based on nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) that entrap an association of minoxidil and latanoprost and target drug delivery to the hair follicles. To do so, thermal techniques combined with FTIR were used to assess the chemical compatibility of the proposed drug association. Then, NLC with 393.5 ± 36.0 nm (PdI < 0.4) and +22.5 ± 0.2 mV zeta potential were produced and shown to entrap 86.9% of minoxidil and 99.9% of latanoprost efficiently. In vitro, the free drug combination was indicated to exert positive effects over human primary epidermal  keratinocytes, supporting cell proliferation, migration and inducing the mRNA expression of MKI67 proliferation marker and VEGF - a possible effector for minoxidil-mediated hair growth. Interestingly, such a favorable drug combination  profile was optimized when delivered using our NLC. Furthermore, according to the HET-CAM and reconstructed human epidermis assays, the nanoformulation was well tolerated. Finally, drug penetration was evaluated in vitro using porcine skin. Such experiments indicated that the NLC could be deposited preferentially into the hair follicles, causing a considerable increase in the penetration of the two drugs in such structures, compared to the control (composed of the free compounds) and generating a target-effect of approximately 50% for both drugs. In summary, present results suggest that hair follicle-targeted delivery of the minoxidil and latanoprost combination is a promising alternative to treat alopecia.	0
34872491	Genome-wide expression of the residual lung reacting to experimental Pneumonectomy.	"BACKGROUND: Acute or chronic irreversible respiratory failure may occur in patients undergoing pneumonectomy. Aim of this study was to determine transcriptome expression changes after experimental pneumonectomy in swine model. Experimental left pneumonectomy was performed in five pigs under general anaesthesia. Both the resected and the remaining lung, after 60 post-operative completely uneventful days, underwent genome-wide bulk RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq). RESULTS: Histological analysis showed dilation of air spaces and rupture of interalveolar septa. In addition, mild inflammation, no fibrosis, radial stretch  of the bronchus, strong enlargement of airspaces and thinning of the blood supply were observed. Bioinformatic analyses of bulk RNA-Seq data identified 553 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) at adjusted P-value below 0.001, between pre- and post-pneumonectomy. The top 10 up-regulated DEGs were Edn1, Areg, Havcr2, Gadd45g, Depp1, Cldn4, Atf3, Myc, Gadd45b, Socs3; the top 10 down-regulated DEGs were Obscn, Cdkn2b, ENSSSCG00000015738, Prrt2, Amer1, Flrt3,  Efnb2, Tox3, Znf793, Znf365. Leveraging digital cytometry tools, no difference in cellular abundance was found between the two experimental groups, while the analysis of cell type-specific gene expression patterns highlighted a striking predominance of macrophage-specific genes among the DEGs. DAVID-based gene ontology analysis showed a significant enrichment of ""Extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway"" (FDR q = 7.60 × 10- 3) and ""Response to insulin"" (FDR q = 7.60 × 10- 3) genes, along with an enrichment of genes involved as ""Negative  regulators of DDX58/IFIH1 signaling"" (FDR q = 7.50 × 10- 4) found by querying the REACTOME pathway database. Gene network analyses indicated a general dysregulation of gene inter-connections. CONCLUSION: This translational genomics study highlighted the existence both of individual genes, mostly dysregulated in certain cellular populations (e.g., macrophages), and gene-networks involved in pulmonary reaction after left pneumonectomy. Their involvement in lung homeostasis is largely supported by previous studies, carried out both in humans and in other animal models (under homeostatic or disease-related conditions), that adopted candidate-gene approaches. Overall, the present findings represent a preliminary assessment for  future, more focused, studies on compensatory lung adaptation, pulmonary regeneration and functional reload."	0
35268189	Molecular Detection and Genetic Characterization of Porcine Circovirus 2 (PCV-2)  in Black-Backed Jackal (Lupulella mesomelas) in Namibia.	Members of the genus Circovirus have been identified in several host species. While initially considered host-specific, there is growing evidence of their presence in unexpected hosts. Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2) is no exception, having been reported in animals belonging to different orders, including carnivores. Recently, PCV-2 was detected in domestic pigs, warthogs and antelopes in Namibia. Considering the potential contact between these populations and wild  carnivores, the presence of PCV-2 was investigated in 32 black-backed jackals (Lupulella mesomelas) shot between February and July 2021 as part of predator control operations in Namibia. Two lung lymph nodes tested positive for PCV-2 by  PCR, confirming the broader-than-expected PCV-2 host tropism and the susceptibility of canids. Sequence analysis demonstrated a close association between the PCV-2s identified in the jackals and PCV-2b strains collected from South African domestic pigs. Although several hypotheses regarding the source of  the jackal's infection are proposed, further studies should be performed to properly assess how PCV-2 is acquired and maintained in the wild and its potential impact on wild and domestic species.	0
35179407	Alpha-Crystallin Association with the Model of Human and Animal Eye Lens-Lipid Membranes is Modulated by Surface Hydrophobicity of Membranes.	PURPOSE: This research aims to probe the interaction of α-crystallin with a model of human, porcine, and mouse lens-lipid membranes. METHODS: Cholesterol/model of human lens-lipid (Chol/MHLL), cholesterol/model of  porcine lens-lipid (Chol/MPLL), and cholesterol/model of mouse lens-lipid (Chol/MMLL) membranes with 0-60 mol% Chol were prepared using the rapid solvent exchange method and probe-tip sonication. The hydrophobicity near the surface of  model lens-lipid membranes and α-crystallin association with these membranes were investigated using the electron paramagnetic resonance spin-labeling approach. RESULTS: With increased Chol content, the hydrophobicity near the surface of Chol/MHLL, Chol/MPLL, and Chol/MMLL membranes, the maximum percentage of membrane surface occupied (MMSO) by α-crystallin, and the association constant (Ka) decreased, showing that surface hydrophobicity of model lens-lipid membranes modulated the α-crystallin association with these membranes. The different MMSO and Ka for different model lens-lipid membranes with different rates of decrease  of MMSO and Ka with increased Chol content and decreased hydrophobicity near the  surface of these membranes suggested that the lipid composition also modulates α-crystallin association with membranes. Despite different lipid compositions, complete inhibition of α-crystallin association with model lens-lipid membranes was observed at saturating Chol content forming cholesterol bilayer domains (CBDs) with the lowest hydrophobicity near the surface of these membranes. The decreased mobility parameter with increased α-crystallin concentration suggested  that membranes near the surface became less mobile due to α-crystallin association. The decreased mobility parameter and increased maximum splitting with increased Chol content suggested that membranes became less mobile and more  ordered near the surface with increased Chol content. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that the interaction of α-crystallin with model lens-lipid membranes is hydrophobic. Furthermore, our data indicated that Chol and CBDs reduce α-crystallin association with lens membrane, likely increase α-crystallin concentration in lens cytoplasm, and possibly favor the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin maintaining lens cytoplasm homeostasis.	0
35049772	Genes Related to Fat Metabolism in Pigs and Intramuscular Fat Content of Pork: A  Focus on Nutrigenetics and Nutrigenomics.	"Fat metabolism and intramuscular fat (IMF) are qualitative traits in pigs whose development are influenced by several genes and metabolic pathways. Nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics offer prospects in estimating nutrients required by a pig. Application of these emerging fields in nutritional science provides an opportunity for matching nutrients based on the genetic make-up of the pig for trait improvements. Today, integration of high throughput ""omics"" technologies into nutritional genomic research has revealed many quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for the mutation(s) of key genes directly or indirectly involved in fat metabolism and IMF deposition in pigs. Nutrient-gene interaction and the underlying molecular mechanisms involved  in fatty acid synthesis and marbling in pigs is difficult to unravel. While existing knowledge on QTLs and SNPs of genes related to fat metabolism and IMF development is yet to be harmonized, the scientific explanations behind the nature of the existing correlation between the nutrients, the genes and the environment remain unclear, being inconclusive or lacking precision. This paper aimed to: (1) discuss nutrigenetics, nutrigenomics and epigenetic mechanisms controlling fat metabolism and IMF accretion in pigs; (2) highlight the potentials of these concepts in pig nutritional programming and research."	0
34977209	Development of an Online Tool for Pasteurella multocida Genotyping and Genotypes  of Pasteurella multocida From Different Hosts.	Pasteurella multocida is a versatile zoonotic pathogen. Multiple systems have been applied to type P. multocida from different diseases in different hosts. Recently, we found that assigning P. multocida strains by combining their capsular, lipopolysaccharide, and MLST genotypes (marked as capsular: lipopolysaccharide: MLST genotype) could help address the biological characteristics of P. multocida circulation in different hosts. However, there is still lack of a rapid and efficient tool to diagnose P. multocida according to this system. Here, we developed an intelligent genotyping platform PmGT for P. multocida strains according to their whole genome sequences using the web 2.0 technologies. By using PmGT, we determined capsular genotypes, LPS genotypes, and MLST genotypes as well as the main virulence factor genes (VFGs) of P. multocida  isolates from different host species based on their whole genome sequences published on NCBI. The results revealed a closer association between the genotypes and pasteurellosis rather than between genotypes and host species. With the advent of high-quality, inexpensive DNA sequencing, PmGT represents a more efficient tool for P. multocida diagnosis in both epidemiological studies and clinical settings.	0
35336958	Antibody Evaluation and Mutations of Antigenic Epitopes in the Spike Protein of the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus from Pig Farms with Repeated Intentional Exposure (Feedback).	The feedback strategy, or controlled exposure of pig herd to the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), significantly decreased losses during a severe outbreak in late 2013 in Taiwan. However, some pig farms still suffered from recurrent outbreaks. To evaluate the association between antibody titers and clinical manifestations, sera and colostra were analyzed from one pig farm that employed the feedback strategy. Furthermore, spike (S) gene full sequences from six positive samples of two farms with and without using feedback were compared to investigate the evolution of PEDV variants circulating in pig herds. The results  in this study showed that high PEDV antibody titers do not correlate with the high rate of protection from PEDV infection. In addition, repeated feedback generated the emergence of PEDV variants with unique substitutions of N537S and Y561H in the COE domain and S769F in the SS6 epitopes. These mutations indicated  the pathogenetic evolution of PEDV strains existing in the cycle of the feedback  method. A very strict biosecurity practice to block the routes of pathogen transfer should be followed to achieve successful control of PEDV infections in pig herds.	0
35123306	Influence of the farrowing process and different sow and piglet traits on uterine involution in a free farrowing system.	An inadequate uterine involution can lead to postpartal disorders in sows and thereby negatively affects the reproductive cycle and performance of the animals. Therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of the farrowing process and different sow and piglet traits on the uterine involution in a free farrowing system. In total three data sets of 48 crossbred sows (Large White x Landrace) from the peripartal period were synthesised and analysed. The uterine diameter of three uterine horns per sow was measured daily during the first two weeks postpartum using ultrasonography and then the uterine regression was calculated. Furthermore, the following sow and piglet traits before and during parturition were assessed: parity, body condition score, backfat thickness, gestation length, number of live born piglets, number of stillborn piglets, farrowing duration, duration of placenta expulsion, litter weight, placenta weight, number of placenta parts, faecal score, and birth induction. In addition, the following parameters were recorded five days after farrowing: body temperature, severity and amount of vaginal discharge, pathological colour of vaginal discharge, and lack of appetite. Spearman's correlation test was used to  examine the association between the parameters within the group and uterine regression. In addition, a linear multiple regression was used to model the relationship between the uterine involution and explanatory variables from the peripartal period. The mean diameter of the uterus decreased from 32.5 mm on day  2 post-partum to 11.4 mm on day 12 post-partum, which is a relative regression of 66%. In the linear multiple regression model, a significant influence of the body condition score (p = 0.046) and the presence of high body temperature (p = 0.022) on uterine involution was detected. When the BCS increases by one unit (from BCS  3 to 4), the relative regression of the uterine involution decreases by approximately 8% and when fever is present, uterine involution is almost 6% slower. Furthermore, a significant correlation between the gestation length and the uterine involution (r = 0.31; p = 0.035) was identified. However, no correlation between the farrowing process and piglets' traits on the uterine involution was detected. This study showed that the body condition score, the gestation length and fever in the first five days after farrowing had significant effects on uterine involution in sows in a free farrowing system. Therefore, these parameters should be routinely monitored in the farrowing management to assess reproductive health post-partum and warrant early intervention.	0
34996026	Review: Concrete outdoor runs for organic growing-finishing pigs - a legislative, ethological and environmental perspective.	Concrete Outdoor Runs (OUTRUNs) are a characteristic part of organic pig housing. They must allow species-specific behaviours such as rooting and elimination, as explicitly required by organic legislation of the European Union (EU). However, OUTRUN design often fails to fulfil behavioural needs, and excreta can cover large parts of the OUTRUN leading to poor pen hygiene and associated ammonia (NH3) emissions. This review integrates legislative, ethological and environmental requirements for OUTRUNs for organic growing-finishing pigs. While  EU regulations specify some welfare-related standards for OUTRUNs (e.g. minimal space allowance), national and private standards interpret some aspects differently, e.g. the proportion of roofed and slatted floor area. Furthermore, reducing NH3 emissions is equally a challenge for organic systems, even though EU legislation does not explicitly refer to OUTRUNs. Depending on the actual use of  the OUTRUN for elimination, higher space allowance compared to conventional production norms increases the potential for a large NH3-emitting surface. The design of pen features (e.g. roof, floor, enrichment) can encourage pigs to separate functional areas and consequently reduce the elimination area and associated NH3 emissions. While providing the main lying area indoors, resting outdoors should be possible for sub-groups during the day. A roof protects pigs and resources (e.g. bedding) from adverse weather, but the effect on pig welfare  and NH3 emissions is site-specific. A floor design that ensures practicable manure removal and drainage is most important to reduce emissions. Providing opportunities for exploring and rooting in the OUTRUN has particular relevance for pigs' behavioural needs and can improve pen hygiene by reducing the elimination area. Cooling facilities are increasingly important to prevent heat stress and its detrimental effects on welfare and pen hygiene. Finally, practicability for farmers needs to be ensured for all resources provided in OUTRUNs, as good management is crucial. Research gaps emerge regarding the association between soiling and NH3 and the influence of certain pen features (shape, roof, feeder location, pen partitions and wet areas) on pig behaviour and soiling.	0
35208756	Dual Antimicrobial Effect of Medium-Chain Fatty Acids against an Italian Multidrug Resistant Brachyspira hyodysenteriae Strain.	The fastidious nature of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae limits an accurate in vitro pre-screening of conventionally used antibiotics and other candidate alternative  antimicrobials. This results in a non-judicious use of antibiotics, leading to an exponential increase of the antibiotic resistance issue and a slowdown in the research for new molecules that might stop this serious phenomenon. In this study we tested four antibiotics (tylosin, lincomycin, doxycycline, and tiamulin) and medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA; hexanoic, octanoic, decanoic, and dodecanoic acid) against an Italian field strain of B. hyodysenteriae and the ATCC 27164 strain as reference. We determined the minimal inhibitory concentrations of these substances, underlining the multidrug resistance pattern of the field strain and, on the contrary, a consistent and stable inhibitory effect of the tested MCFA against both strains. Then, sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics and MCFA were examined in modulating a panel of B. hyodysenteriae virulence genes (tlyA, tlyB, bhlp16, bhlp29.7, and bhmp39f). Results of gene expression analysis were variable, with up- and downregulations not properly correlated with particular substances or target genes. Decanoic and dodecanoic acid with their direct and indirect antimicrobial property were the most effective among MCFA, suggesting them as good candidates for subsequent in vivo trials.	0
35443903	Comparison of three antioxidants in chemical and biological assays on porcine oocytes during ageing in vitro.	Our previous studies have already revealed that β-cryptoxanthin (BCX), hesperetin (HES), and icariin (ICA) antioxidants are effective for in vitro maturation (IVM) of porcine oocytes. In this study, we investigated which of BCX, HES, or ICA was  more effective for IVM of porcine oocytes. The antioxidant properties were assessed with aged porcine oocytes and embryos by comparing 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)hydrazyl (DPPH), reducing power, and H2O2 scavenging activity assays. The chemical assay results demonstrated that BCX had  a greater DPPH scavenging activity and reducing power than HES and ICA, compared  with controls. However, the H2O2 scavenging activity of the antioxidants was similar when tested at the optimal concentrations of 1 μM BCX (BCX-1), 100 μM HES (HES-100), and 5 μM ICA (ICA-5). The biological assay results showed that BCX-1 treatment was more effective in inducing a significant reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS), improving glutathione levels, and increasing the expression of antioxidant genes. In addition, BCX-1 inhibited apoptosis by increasing the expression of anti-apoptotic genes and decreasing pro-apoptotic genes in porcine  parthenogenetic blastocysts. BCX-1 also significantly increased the blastocyst formation rate compared with the ageing control group, HES-100 and ICA-5. This study demonstrates that damage from ROS produced during oocyte ageing can be prevented by supplementing antioxidants into the IVM medium, and BCX may be a potential candidate to improve assisted reproductive technologies.	0
35249475	Effect of feeding regimen on circadian activity rhythms of food anticipatory by ghrelin hormone in a pig model.	Increasingly diverse meal patterns affect the internal body clock. Ghrelin secretion is closely associated with the anticipation of a regularly scheduled mealtime, leading ghrelin to be a putative candidate for food-related entraining  signals that drive activity rhythms. Here, growing pigs with different meal frequencies were used to construct an irregular eating pattern model. We found that irregular eating patterns changed central ghrelin levels of pigs, affected the circadian entrainment and circadian rhythm pathways in hypothalamus tissue, and altered the daily behavior and food anticipatory activity (FAA). To determine whether ghrelin exerts an effect, growing pigs were intravenously injected with ghrelin antagonist [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 for 7 days. We showed here that [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 administration decreased locomotor activity of growing pigs in the 4-h window preceding onset of food availability. In addition, we also confirmed that the direct role of ghrelin in molecular mechanism of regulating clock genes expression via calcium mobilization through intracellular PKC/PLC and AC/PKA pathways in vitro. Collectively, irregular eating patterns affect the central circadian system by ghrelin, supporting ghrelin as a temporal messenger of food-entrainment in hypothalamic circadian functions.	0
35059141	Detecting the differential genomic variants using cross-population phenotype-associated variant (XP-PAV) of the Landrace and Yorkshire pigs in Korea.	Although there have been many genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and selective sweep analyses to understand pig genomic regions related to growth performance, these methods considered only the gene effect and selection signal,  respectively. In this study, we suggest the cross-population phenotype associated variant (XP-PAV) analysis as a novel method to determine the genomic variants with different effects between the two populations. XP-PAV analysis could reveal  the differential genetic variants between the two populations by considering the  gene effect and selection signal simultaneously. In this study, we used daily weight gain (DWG) and back fat thickness (BF) as phenotypes and the Landrace and  Yorkshire populations were used for XP-PAV analysis. The main aim was to reveal the differential selection by considering the gene effect between Landrace and Yorkshire pigs. In the gene ontology analysis of XP-PAV results, differential selective genes in DWG analysis were involved in the regulation of interleukin-2  production and cell cycle G2/M transition. The protein modification and glycerophospholipid biosynthetic processes were the most enriched terms in the BF analysis. Therefore, we could identify genetic differences for immune and several metabolic pathways between Landrace and Yorkshire breeds using the XP-PAV analysis. In this study, we expect that XP-PAV analysis will play a role in determining useful selective variants with gene effects and provide a new interpretation of the genetic differences between the two populations.	0
35205304	MiR-218-5p Affects Subcutaneous Adipogenesis by Targeting ACSL1, a Novel Candidate for Pig Fat Deposition.	As a centre enzyme in fatty acid activation, acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 (ACSL1) plays an important role in body lipid homeostasis. However, the functions of ACSL1 in the subcutaneous adipogenesis of pigs are largely unknown. In the present study, we found that the expression of ACSL1 significantly increased during the process of porcine preadipocyte differentiation. Moreover, silencing of ACSL1 in preadipocytes decreased levels of triglyceride and adipogenic-related markers, including FABP4, APOE, and FASN (p < 0.01), and simultaneously increased levels of lipolytic-related markers, such as ATGL and HSL (p < 0.05). Conversely, overexpression of ACSL1 in preadipocytes increased levels of triglyceride and FABP4, APOE, and FASN (p < 0.01), and reduced levels of ATGL and HSL (p < 0.05). Luciferase reporter assays  revealed that ACSL1 is a target of miR-218-5p, which can reduce the mRNA and protein levels of ACSL1 by directly binding the 3' untranslated region of ACSL1.  Furthermore, miR-218-5p has an inhibition role in porcine preadipocyte differentiation by suppressing ACSL1 expression. Taken together, these data provide insights into the mechanism of the miR-218-5p/ACSL1 axis in regulating subcutaneous fat deposition of pigs.	0
35189068	Cloning of FITM2 gene and investigating its expression levels in Banna miniature  inbred pig (Sus scrofa) tissues.	Fat storage-inducing transmembrane protein 2 (FITM2) plays an important role in regulating lipid storage and could be regarded as a candidate gene for intramuscular fat deposition in pigs. The aim of this study was to clone the coding domain sequence (CDS) of FITM2 gene, to compare the nucleotide acid and deduced amino acid sequences between breeds and species, to analyze the structure and characteristics of protein and to detect the expression profile of gene. The  results exhibited that the CDS of FITM2 gene was 789 bp in length. The mutation of nucleotide acids led to the mutation of deduced amino acids between Banna miniature inbred pigs and other two breeds (Yorkshire × Landrace pigs and Duroc × (Landrace × Yorkshire) pigs). It was indicated that high identities of nucleotide acid and deduced amino acid sequences between Banna miniature inbred pigs and other species. The deduced amino acids were composed of loops and alpha helices in the structure. FITM2 protein may be a 30 kDa hydrophobic protein with 26 phosphorylation sites and one potential N-glycosylated site. FITM2 gene was widely expressed in various tissues, and the highest expression level was in adipose tissue.	0
34868241	Trait-specific Selection Signature Detection Reveals Novel Loci of Meat Quality in Large White Pigs.	In past decades, meat quality traits have been shaped by human-driven selection in the process of genetic improvement programs. Exploring the potential genetic basis of artificial selection and mapping functional candidate genes for economic traits are of great significance in genetic improvement of pigs. In this study, we focus on investigating the genetic basis of five meat quality traits, including intramuscular fat content (IMF), drip loss, water binding capacity, pH  at 45 min (pH45min), and ultimate pH (pH24h). Through making phenotypic gradient  differential population pairs, Wright's fixation index (FST) and the cross-population extended haplotype homozogysity (XPEHH) were applied to detect selection signatures for these five traits. Finally, a total of 427 and 307 trait-specific selection signatures were revealed by FST and XPEHH, respectively. Further bioinformatics analysis indicates that some genes, such as USF1, NDUFS2,  PIGM, IGSF8, CASQ1, and ACBD6, overlapping with the trait-specific selection signatures are responsible for the phenotypes including fat metabolism and muscle development. Among them, a series of promising trait-specific selection signatures that were detected in the high IMF subpopulation are located in the region of 93544042-95179724bp on SSC4, and the genes harboring in this region are all related to lipids and muscle development. Overall, these candidate genes of meat quality traits identified in this analysis may provide some fundamental information for further exploring the genetic basis of this complex trait.	0
34901898	Interaction of Klebsiella pneumoniae with tissue macrophages in a mouse infection model and ex-vivo pig organ perfusions: an exploratory investigation.	BACKGROUND: Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) strains of capsule type K1 and K2 cause invasive infections associated with hepatic abscesses, which can be  difficult to treat and are frequently associated with relapsing infections. Other K pneumoniae strains (non-hvKp), including lineages that have acquired carbapenem resistance, do not manifest this pathology. In this work we aimed to test the hypothesis that within-macrophage replication is a key mechanism underpinning abscess formation in hvKp infections. METHODS: In this exploratory investigation, to study the pathophysiology of abscess formation, mice were intravenously infected with 106 colony forming units (CFU) of either hvKp isolates (six strains) or non-hvKp isolates (seven strains). Intracellular bacterial replication and neutrophil influx in liver and spleen was quantified by fluorescence microscopy of sliced cryopreserved organs of mice collected 30 min, 6 h, and 24 h after infection with the aim to provide data of bacterial association to Kupffer cells in the liver and to the different tissue macrophages in the spleen. Microbiological and microscopy analysis of an ex-vivo  model of pig liver and spleen infection were used to confirm within-macrophage replication. Pig organs were perfused with heparinised, autologous pig's blood and injected with 6·5 × 107 CFU of hvKp K2 sequence type 25 strain GMR151. Blood  and tissue biopsies collected before infection and 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, and 5 h after infection were used to measure bacterial counts and to identify the subcellular localisation of bacteria by immunohistochemistry analysis. FINDINGS: We show that hvKp resisted phagocyte-mediated clearance and replicated  in mouse liver macrophages to form clusters 6 h after infection, with a mean of 7·0 bacteria per Kupffer cell (SD 6·2); however, non-hvKp were efficiently cleared (mean 1·5 bacteria per cell [SD 1·1]). HvKp infection promoted neutrophil recruitment to sites of infection, which in the liver resulted in histopathological signs of abscess formation as early as 24 h post-infection. Experiments in pig organs which share a high functional and anatomical resemblance to human organs, provided strong evidence for the propensity of hvKp  to replicate within the hepatic macrophages. INTERPRETATION: These findings show subversion of innate immune processes in the  liver by K pneumoniae and resistance to Kupffer cell mediated clearance as an explanation for the propensity of hvKp strains to cause hepatic abscesses.

35434674	Cortical bone trajectory fixation cause low compression force in anterior vertebral column.	Background: The cortical bone trajectory (CBT) screws follow a caudocephalad and  lateral path from the pedicle to the vertebral body. The bone fusion rate of CBT  fixation is equal to or lower than conventional pedicle screw fixation. It remains unclear whether or not CVT screws exert equally compressive forces across the vertebral column. In this study, we intraoperatively examined the insertional torque of CBT screws, and investigated the compression loading and pressure distribution in conventional and CBT fixation using pig bones. Methods: The insertional torque was measured for a total of 115 CBT screws. Detailed positions of these screws were retrospectively confirmed using CT scans. Screw loosening and interbody fusion were examined 1 year after surgery. In the experiment using pig bones, we inserted screws by conventional trajectory (n = 3) and CBT (n = 4). Results: Multiple regression analysis showed that the total screw length, the distance from the screw to the medial border of the pedicle and the distance from the superior endplate of the vertebrae were significant independent factors affecting the insertional torque. There was no significant association between the insertional torque and the radiographic bone fusion rate 12 months after surgery. The average pressure and the compression loading in the anterior column  were significantly lower in CBT group. Conclusion: These results suggested that the long CBT screws as close to the endplate had high insertional torque, but the anterior column in CBT fixation showed low compression force leading to the insufficient holding intervertebral cage. CBT screws may cause the micromotion of cages, which lowers the bone fusion rate.	0
34850103	Bringing the Animal QTLdb and CorrDB into the future: meeting new challenges and  providing updated services.	The Animal QTLdb (https://www.animalgenome.org/QTLdb) and CorrDB (https://www.animalgenome.org/CorrDB) are unique resources for livestock animal genetics and genomics research which have been used extensively by the international livestock genome research community. This is largely due to the active development of the databases over the years to keep up with the rapid advancement of genome sciences. The ongoing development has ensured that these databases provide researchers not only with continually updated data but also with new web tools to disseminate the data. Through our continued efforts, the databases have evolved from the original Pig QTLdb for cross-experiment QTL data  comparisons to an Animal QTLdb hosting 220 401 QTL, SNP association and eQTL data linking phenotype to genotype for 2210 traits. In addition, there are 23 552 correlations for 866 traits and 4273 heritability data on 1069 traits in CorrDB.  All these data were curated from 3157 publications that cover seven livestock species. Along with the continued data curation, new species, additional genome builds, and new functions and features have been built into the databases as well. Standardized procedures to support data mapping on multiple species/genome  builds and the ability to browse data based on linked ontology terms are highlights of the recent developments.	0
35180661	A biosecurity survey on Iberian pig farms in Spain: Farmers' attitudes towards the implementation of measures and investment.	The Iberian pork industry has proven to be very important in South-Western Europe, not only due its contribution to the economy of the area, but also because of the peculiarities of the farms situated there. These farms raise Iberian pigs in systems ranging from fully outdoor rearing systems to intensive-rearing farms similar to the conventional pig production models. The implementation of biosecurity measures in Iberian pig farms can be complex and, at times, it can be perceived somewhat negatively by farmers, especially those who run more extensive pig production systems. This research attempts to understand the attitudes of Iberian pig farmers in the South-West of Spain towards the adoption of and investment in biosecurity measures. For that purpose, data obtained from 104 online surveys taken by Iberian pig farmers in 2019 was analysed. A correspondence and a cluster analysis were performed, whereby three farm groups were identified according to their features (land area, breeding conditions, availability of facilities, etc.), the existence/use of biosecurity facilities and the adoption of biosecurity measures. The results have shown that  most of the analysed farms have the necessary infrastructure to comply with the biosecurity principles and farmers perform basic biosecurity practices. However,  farms that are more extensive, mainly those finishing their pigs outdoors (acorn-feed), need to improve their biosecurity. It is necessary therefore to implement an improvement plan following the current regulations in collaboration  with policy makers with the purpose of improving the levels of biosecurity and increase disease risk awareness.	0
35341848	Exposure to industrial hog operations and gastrointestinal illness in North Carolina, USA.	"With 9 million hogs, North Carolina (NC) is the second leading hog producer in the United States. Most hogs are housed at concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), where millions of tons of hog waste can pollute air and water with fecal pathogens that can cause diarrhea, vomiting, and/or nausea (known as acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI)). We used NC's ZIP code-level emergency department (ED) data to calculate rates of AGI ED visits (2016-2019) and swine permit data to estimate hog exposure. Case exposure was estimated as the inverse distances from each hog CAFO to census block centroids, weighting with Gaussian decay and by manure amount per CAFO, then aggregated to ZIP code using population weights.  We compared ZIP codes in the upper quartile of hog exposure (""high hog exposed"")  to those without hog exposure. Using inverse probability of treatment weighting,  we created a control with similar demographics to the high hog exposed population and calculated rate ratios using quasi-Poisson models. We examined effect measure modification of rurality and race using adjusted models. In high hog exposed areas compared to areas without hog exposure, we observed a 11% increase (95% CI: 1.06, 1.17) in AGI rate and 21% increase specifically in rural areas (95% CI: 0.98, 1.43). When restricted to rural areas, we found an increased AGI rate among American Indian (RR = 4.29, 95% CI: 3.69, 4.88) and Black (RR = 1.45, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.91) residents. The association was stronger during the week after heavy rain (RR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.62) and in areas with both poultry and swine CAFOs (RR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.48, 1.57). Residing near CAFOs may increase rates of  AGI ED visits. Hog CAFOs are disproportionally built near rural Black and American Indian communities in NC and are associated with increased AGI most strongly in these populations."	0
35411431	Effects of MitraClip Therapy on Mitral Flow Patterns and Vortex Formation: An In  Vitro Study.	MitraClip transcatheter edge-to-edge repair is used to treat mitral regurgitation (MR). While MR is reduced, diastolic left ventricular flows are altered. An in vitro left heart simulator was used to assess a porcine mitral valve in the native, MR, and MR plus MitraClip cases. Velocity, vorticity, and Reynolds shear  stress (RSS) were quantified by particle image velocimetry. Peak velocity increased from 1.20 m/s for native to 1.30 m/s with MR. With MitraClip, two divergent jets of 1.18 and 0.61 m/s emerged. Higher vorticity was observed with MR than native and lessened with MitraClip. MitraClip resulted in shear layer formation and downstream vortex formation. Native RSS decreased from 33 Pa in acceleration to 29 Pa at peak flow, then increased to 31 Pa with deceleration. MR RSS increased from 27 Pa in acceleration to 40 Pa at peak flow to 59 Pa during deceleration. MitraClip RSS increased from 79 Pa in acceleration to 162 Pa during peak flow, then decreased to 45 Pa during deceleration. After MitraClip, two divergent jets of reduced velocity emerged, accompanied by shear layers and recirculation. Chaotic flow developed, resulting in elevated RSS magnitude and coverage. Findings help understand consequences of MitraClip on left ventricular  flow dynamics.	0
35215890	Effects of the NF-κB Signaling Pathway Inhibitor BAY11-7082 in the Replication of ASFV.	African swine fever virus (ASFV) mainly infects the monocyte/macrophage lineage of pigs and regulates the production of cytokines that influence host immune responses. Several studies have reported changes in cytokine production after infection with ASFV, but the regulatory mechanisms have not yet been elucidated.  Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the immune response mechanism of  ASFV using transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. Through multi-omics joint analysis, it was found that ASFV infection regulates the expression of the host NF-B signal pathway and related cytokines. Additionally, changes in the NF-κB signaling pathway and IL-1β and IL-8 expression in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) infected with ASFV were examined. Results show that ASFV infection activates the NF-κB signaling pathway and up-regulates the expression of IL-1β and IL-8. The NF-κB inhibitor BAY11-7082 inhibited the expression profiles of phospho-NF-κB p65, p-IκB, and MyD88 proteins, and inhibited ASFV-induced NF-κB signaling pathway activation. Additionally, the results show that the NF-κB inhibitor BAY11-7082 can inhibit the replication of ASFV and can inhibit IL-1β and, IL-8 expression. Overall, the findings of this study indicate that ASFV infection activates the NF-κB signaling pathway and up-regulates the expression of IL-1β and IL-8, and inhibits the replication of ASFV by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway and interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-8 production. These findings not only provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of the association between the NF-κB signaling pathway and ASFV infection, but also indicate that the NF-κB signaling pathway is a potential immunomodulatory pathway that controls ASF.	0
34974356	From Mendel laws to whole genetic association study to decipher the swine mulefoot phenotype.	The swine mulefoot (SM) is a rare condition characterized by a non-cloven hoof due to the partial or total fusion of the phalanges. No comprehensive study has been conducted to identify associated markers with this phenotype until now. We aimed to characterize the association between SNP and the mulefoot phenotype using a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). An experimental population was produced using a half-sib mating where the male had the mulefoot phenotype and the females (n = 6) had cloven hoofs. The cross resulted in 27 (47%) animals with the mulefoot characteristic and 30 (53%) normal animals, indicating the possible  dominant gene action. Animals were further genotyped using the Illumina PorcineSNP50k BeadChip, and SNPs were tested for associations. Twenty-nine SNPs located on the SSC15, SSC4, and SSCX were associated with the mulefoot phenotype  (p-value <5 × 10-5). Six markers were found in the intronic regions of VWC2L, CATIP, PDK3, PCYT1B, and POLA1 genes. The marker rs81277626, on SSC15:116,886,110 bp, is located in the Von Willebrand Factor C Domain (VWC2L), a possible functional candidate gene. The VWC2L is part of a biological process involved with the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway, previously  associated with syndactyly in other species. In conclusion, the identified markers suggest the involvement of the VWC2L gene in the SM phenotype in this population.	0
35089527	Clinically relevant experimental rodent models of diabetic foot ulcer.	Chronic wounds are a substantial clinical problem in diabetes and nearly 6% of diabetics suffer from foot disease including ulceration, infection, and tissue necrosis. Wound healing in diabetes is impaired and delayed and is augmented by diabetic complications. Wound healing involves complex cellular, molecular, and biochemical processes and animal models are the most suitable prototype to investigate and understand the underlying pathological changes in the process of  wound healing. Animal models are also useful in evaluating the safety and efficacy of newer therapeutic agents and improving the clinical approaches for human patients with chronic ulcers. The wound healing strategies get more complicated in the presence of diabetes and its associated complication. Despite  the advancement in methods of wound healing, the healing of the chronic diabetic  foot ulcer (DFU) remains an important clinical problem resulting in costly and prolonged treatment and poses a risk for major amputation. Saying that it is important to elucidate the newer therapeutic targets and strategies via an in-depth understanding of the complicated cascade of the chronic DFU. A major challenge in translating lab findings to clinics is the lack of an optimal preclinical model capable of properly recapitulating human wounds. Both small and large animal models of wound healing involving rodents, rabbits, and pigs have been discussed. Mouse and rats as small animal models and pig as large animal models have been discussed in association with the diabetic wound but there are advantages and limitations for each model. In this review, we critically reviewed the pros and cons of experimental models of diabetic wound healing with a focus on type II diabetes rodent models.	0
35303917	Comparative analysis of Streptococcus suis genomes identifies novel candidate virulence-associated genes in North American isolates.	Streptococcus suis is a significant economic and welfare concern in the swine industry. Pan-genome analysis provides an in-silico approach for the discovery of genes involved in pathogenesis in bacterial pathogens. In this study, we performed pan-genome analysis of 208 S. suis isolates classified into the pathogenic, possibly opportunistic, and commensal pathotypes to identify novel candidate virulence-associated genes (VAGs) of S. suis. Using chi-square tests and LASSO regression models, three accessory pan-genes corresponding to S. suis strain P1/7 markers SSU_RS09525, SSU_RS09155, and SSU_RS03100 (>95% identity) were identified as having a significant association with the pathogenic pathotype. The proposed novel SSU_RS09525 + /SSU_RS09155 + /SSU_RS03100 + genotype identified 96% of the pathogenic pathotype strains, suggesting a novel genotyping scheme for predicting the pathogenicity of S. suis isolates in North America. In addition, mobile genetic elements carrying antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and VAGs were identified but did not appear to play a major role in the spread of ARGs and VAGs.	0
34985359	Is Porcine Small Intestinal Submucosal Extracellular Matrix (ECM) a Suitable Material for Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Reconstruction in Association With Pulmonary Valve Replacement?	Pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) with right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) reconstruction is a common congenital cardiac operation. Porcine submucosal intestinal-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) patches have been used for RVOT reconstruction. We present 2 adult patients with Tetralogy of Fallot who underwent PVR with RVOT reconstruction utilizing ECM. Both cases required reoperation due to patch dehiscence causing a large paravalvular leak. One patient also had a pseudoaneurysm associated with ECM dehiscence. There may be a  propensity for ECM dehiscence in this application and, based on these cases, we recommend avoidance of ECM in RVOT reconstruction with PVR. PVR patients repaired with ECM should be monitored for this complication.	0
35178067	Identification of Potential Candidate Genes From Co-Expression Module Analysis During Preadipocyte Differentiation in Landrace Pig.	Preadipocyte differentiation plays an important role in lipid deposition and affects fattening efficiency in pigs. In the present study, preadipocytes isolated from the subcutaneous adipose tissue of three Landrace piglets were induced into mature adipocytes in vitro. Gene clusters associated with fat deposition were investigated using RNA sequencing data at four time points during preadipocyte differentiation. Twenty-seven co-expression modules were subsequently constructed using weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses  revealed three modules (blue, magenta, and brown) as being the most critical during preadipocyte differentiation. Based on these data and our previous differentially expressed gene analysis, angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) was identified as a key regulator of preadipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism. After inhibition of ANGPTL4, the expression of adipogenesis-related genes was reduced, except for that of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which was negatively regulated by ANGPTL4 during preadipocyte differentiation. Our findings provide a new perspective to understand the mechanism of fat deposition.	0
35203165	Evaluation of Stress Accompanying Immunocontraceptive Vaccination in Donkeys.	The overpopulation of donkeys is recognized as a problem in many parts of the world. The main concerns with uncontrolled donkey populations are habitat degradation and competition for feed resources between donkeys and other species. One of the most effective and humane solutions is the use of immunocontraception. Therefore, this study sought to evaluate the stress imposed by the use of two formulations of a zona pellucida (ZP) vaccine, a recombinant (reZP) and a native  porcine (pZP) vaccine, both formulated with a Freund's adjuvant. The stress was objectively measured using fecal cortisol concentrations and physical examination parameters at fixed points before and after vaccination. We hypothesized that fewer changes in physical exam parameters and lower fecal cortisol concentrations would be stimulated in jennies treated with the reZP vaccine due to the selection of specific proteins. Twenty-five reproductively sound jennies were randomly assigned to reZP (n = 9), pZP (n = 8) or control (n = 8) groups. The vaccines were administered at five-week intervals. Physical exam parameters and body wall  thickness of injection sites were recorded for each jenny for four days post-injections. Fecal samples were obtained every other day from day 0 (first vaccination) through day 6 and on days 35 to 41 after booster. Injection site reactions were common in all groups with the reZP and pZP groups being overrepresented. Lameness was observed in the pZP and reZP groups that were affected by injection site reactions and open abscesses. The present study showed an increase in fecal cortisol concentrations within 4 days after the first vaccination with ZP vaccines and, thereafter, a decrease in cortisol 35 days later after the second vaccination, especially in donkeys with open abscesses. Our results suggest that acute stress (increased cortisol) was induced after the  first vaccination, and chronic stress (decreased cortisol) occurred thereafter in association with open abscesses. In conclusion, reZP and pZP formulated with Freund's adjuvant induced local inflammatory reactions with a differential degree of acute and chronic stress in donkeys.	0
35205240	Investigation of the Genetic Architecture of Pigs Subjected to Breeding Intensification.	Pigs are strategically important animals for the agricultural industry. An assessment of genetic differentiation between pigs, undergone and not undergone to selection intensification, is of particular interest. Our research was conducted on two groups of Large White pigs grown on the same farm but in different years. A total of 165 samples were selected with 78 LW_А (n = 78, the Russian selection) and LW_B (n = 87, a commercial livestock). For genotyping, we  used GeneSeek® GGP Porcine HD Genomic Profiler v1 (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA, USA). To define breeding characteristics of selection, we used smoothing FST and  segment identification of HBD (Homozygous-by-Descent). The results of smoothing FST showed 20 areas of a genome with strong ejection regions of the genome located on all chromosomes except SSC2, SSC3, and SSC8. The average realized autozygosity in Large White pigs of native selection was in (LW_A)-0.21, in LW_В-0.29. LW_А showed 13,338 HBD segments, 171 per one animal, and LW_B-15,747 HBD segments, 181 per one animal. The ejections found by the smoothing FST method were partially localized in the HBD regions. In these areas, the genes ((NCBP1, PLPPR1, GRIN3A, NBEA, TRPC4, HS6ST3, NALCN, SMG6, TTC3, KCNJ6, IKZF2, OBSL1, CARD10, ETV6, VWF, CCND2, TSPAN9, CDH13, CEP128, SERPINA11, PIK3CG, COG5, BCAP29, SLC26A4) were defined. The revealed genes can be of special interest for further  studying their influence on an organism of an animal since they can act as candidate genes for selection-significant traits.	0
35034121	Identify known and novel candidate genes associated with backfat thickness in Duroc pigs by large-scale genome-wide association analysis.	Backfat thickness (BFT) is complex and economically important traits in the pig industry, since it reflects fat deposition and can be used to measure the carcass lean meat percentage in pigs. In this study, all 6,550 pigs were genotyped using  the Geneseek Porcine 50K SNP Chip to identify SNPs related to BFT and to search for candidate genes through genome-wide association analysis in two Duroc populations. In total, 80 SNPs, including 39 significant and 41 suggestive SNPs,  and 6 QTLs were identified significantly associated with the BFT. In addition, 9  candidate genes, including a proven major gene MC4R, 3 important candidate genes  (RYR1, HMGA1, and NUDT3) which were previously described as related to BFT, and 5 novel candidate genes (SIRT2, NKAIN2, AMH, SORCS1, and SORCS3) were found based on their potential functional roles in BFT. The functions of candidate genes and  gene set enrichment analysis indicate that most important pathways are related to energy homeostasis and adipogenesis. Finally, our data suggest that most of the candidate genes can be directly used for genetic improvement through molecular markers, except that the MC4R gene has an antagonistic effect on growth rate and  carcass lean meat percentage in breeding. Our results will advance our understanding of the complex genetic architecture of BFT traits and laid the foundation for additional genetic studies to increase carcass lean meat percentage of pig through marker-assisted selection and/or genomic selection.	0
34960607	Gammaherpesvirus Infections in Cattle in Europe.	The genus Macavirus, subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae, comprises ungulate viruses that infect domestic and wild ruminants and swine. They cause asymptomatic latent infections in reservoir hosts and malignant catarrhal fever in susceptible species. Lung, spleen, bronchial lymph node, and tongue were collected from 448 cattle (348 necropsied, 100 slaughtered) in Switzerland, United Kingdom, Finland, Belgium, and Germany to determine their infection with bovine herpesvirus-6 (BoHV-6) and gammaherpesviruses of other ruminants, i.e., ovine herpesvirus-1 and -2, caprine herpesvirus-2, and bison lymphotropic herpesvirus, using quantitative PCR. Only BoHV-6 was detected, with an overall frequency of 32%, ranging between  22% and 42% in the different countries. Infection was detected across all ages, from one day after birth, and was positively correlated with age. There was no evidence of an association with specific disease processes. In positive animals,  BoHV-6 was detected in all organs with high frequency, consistently in the lungs  or spleen. Viral loads varied substantially. In BoHV-6-positive gravid cows, organs of fetuses tested negative for infection, indicating that the virus is not vertically transmitted. Our results confirm previous data indicating that BoHV-6  is a commensal of domestic cattle not associated with disease processes and confirm that infections with other macaviruses are rare and sporadic.	0
35257788	Microbiome biomarkers associated with the gut contraction response elicited by the Japanese traditional medicine daikenchuto.	Objective biomarkers are crucial in the development of personalized medicines, such as Japanese traditional medicine (Kampo). To date, some objective markers to predict the response of Kampo medicines have been reported, but the information is somewhat limited. The aim of this study was to search for objective markers and combinations thereof to estimate the effect of the Japanese traditional medicine daikenchuto (DKT) on colon contraction intensity in guinea pigs. Specifically, the microbiome biomarkers were employed as candidate, using the Fisher ratio and the nearest neighbor classifier for statistical pattern recognition. The combination of the ratio between gut microbes of family Ruminococcaceae/Rikenellaceae, Ruminococcaceae/Paraprevotellaceae, and genus Ruminococcus/unknown genus in family Rikenellaceae of guinea pig gut microbes was found to influence the activity of DKT with 0.8 accuracy for test samples. These  findings suggest that statistical pattern recognition can contribute to identifying target markers of multi-target drugs such as Kampo.	0
35100362	Genome-wide association study of disease resilience traits from a natural polymicrobial disease challenge model in pigs identifies the importance of the major histocompatibility complex region.	Infectious diseases cause tremendous financial losses in the pork industry, emphasizing the importance of disease resilience, which is the ability of an animal to maintain performance under disease. Previously, a natural polymicrobial disease challenge model was established, in which pigs were challenged in the late nursery phase by multiple pathogens to maximize expression of genetic differences in disease resilience. Genetic analysis found that performance traits in this model, including growth rate, feed and water intake, and carcass traits,  as well as clinical disease phenotypes, were heritable and could be selected for  to increase disease resilience of pigs. The objectives of the current study were  to identify genomic regions that are associated with disease resilience in this model, using genome-wide association studies and fine-mapping methods, and to use gene set enrichment analyses to determine whether genomic regions associated with disease resilience are enriched for previously published quantitative trait loci, functional pathways, and differentially expressed genes subject to physiological  states. Multiple quantitative trait loci were detected for all recorded performance and clinical disease traits. The major histocompatibility complex region was found to explain substantial genetic variance for multiple traits, including for growth rate in the late nursery (12.8%) and finisher (2.7%), for several clinical disease traits (up to 2.7%), and for several feeding and drinking traits (up to 4%). Further fine mapping identified 4 quantitative trait  loci in the major histocompatibility complex region for growth rate in the late nursery that spanned the subregions for class I, II, and III, with 1 single-nucleotide polymorphism in the major histocompatibility complex class I subregion capturing the largest effects, explaining 0.8-27.1% of genetic variance for growth rate and for multiple clinical disease traits. This single-nucleotide  polymorphism was located in the enhancer of TRIM39 gene, which is involved in innate immune response. The major histocompatibility complex region was pleiotropic for growth rate in the late nursery and finisher, and for treatment and mortality rates. Growth rate in the late nursery showed strong negative genetic correlations in the major histocompatibility complex region with treatment or mortality rates (-0.62 to -0.85) and a strong positive genetic correlation with growth rate in the finisher (0.79). Gene set enrichment analyses found genomic regions associated with resilience phenotypes to be enriched for previously identified disease susceptibility and immune capacity quantitative trait loci, for genes that were differentially expressed following bacterial or virus infection and immune response, and for gene ontology terms related to immune and inflammatory response. In conclusion, the major histocompatibility complex and other quantitative trait loci that harbor immune-related genes were identified to be associated with disease resilience traits in a large-scale natural polymicrobial disease challenge. The major histocompatibility complex region was pleiotropic for growth rate under challenge and for clinical disease traits. Four quantitative trait loci were identified across the class I, II, and  III subregions of the major histocompatibility complex for nursery growth rate under challenge, with 1 single-nucleotide polymorphism in the major histocompatibility complex class I subregion capturing the largest effects. The major histocompatibility complex and other quantitative trait loci identified play an important role in host response to infectious diseases and can be incorporated in selection to improve disease resilience, in particular the identified single-nucleotide polymorphism in the major histocompatibility complex class I subregion.	0
35324170	Circular RNA Profiling Identifies Novel circPPARA that Promotes Intramuscular Fat Deposition in Pigs.	Intramuscular fat (IMF) content plays an important role in pork quality. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) implicate various biological processes; however, the regulatory mechanisms and functions of circRNAs in porcine IMF remains elusive. Hence, the study assessed the circRNA expression profiling in the longissimus dorsi muscle of pigs with high (H) and low (L) IMF content to unravel their regulatory functions in improving meat quality. The RNA sequencing analysis identified 29,732 circRNAs from six sampled pigs, most of which were exon-derived. In the muscle, 336 were differentially expressed (DE) between the H and L IMF groups; 196 circRNAs were upregulated, and 140 were downregulated. Subsequent qRT-PCR validation of 10 DE circRNAs revealed expression patterns consistent with the RNA-seq data. Gene ontology and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that most significantly enriched DE circRNAs' host genes were linked to lipid metabolism and adipogenesis processes. The circRNA-miRNA regulatory network analysis found several circRNAs targeting miRNAs associated with adipogenesis. Finally, a novel  circRNA, circPPARA, was identified with the expression positively correlated with the IMF content. Detailed analysis revealed that circPPARA was formed via head-to-tail splicing and was more stable than the linear PPARA, predominantly located in the cytoplasm. Functional studies using overexpression and siRNA constructs demonstrated that circPPARA promotes differentiation and hinders the proliferation of porcine intramuscular preadipocytes. Moreover, the dual-luciferase assay revealed that circPPARA adsorbed miR-429 and miR-200b, thereby promoting intramuscular adipogenesis in pigs. Our results identified a candidate circRNA, circPPARA, that affects porcine IMF content. The study provides knowledge of the regulatory functions of circRNAs in intramuscular adipogenesis and abundant resource for future research on circRNAs in pigs.	0
35183111	Comparison of the choice of animals for re-sequencing in two maternal pig lines.	Next-generation sequencing is a promising approach for the detection of causal variants within previously identified quantitative trait loci. Because of the costs of re-sequencing experiments, this application is currently mainly restricted to subsets of animals from already genotyped populations. Imputation from a lower to a higher marker density could represent a useful complementary approach. An analysis of the literature shows that several strategies are available to select animals for re-sequencing. This study demonstrates an animal  selection workflow under practical conditions. Our approach considers different data sources and limited resources such as budget and availability of sampling material. The workflow combines previously described approaches and makes use of  genotype and pedigree information from a Landrace and Large White population. Genotypes were phased and haplotypes were accurately estimated with AlphaPhase. Then, AlphaSeqOpt was used to optimize selection of animals for re-sequencing, reflecting the existing diversity of haplotypes. AlphaSeqOpt and ENDOG were used  to select individuals based on pedigree information and by taking into account key animals that represent the genetic diversity of the populations. After the best selection criteria were determined, a subset of 57 animals was selected for  subsequent re-sequencing. In order to evaluate and assess the advantage of this procedure, imputation accuracy was assessed by setting a set of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip genotypes to missing. Accuracy values were compared to those of alternative selection scenarios and the results showed the clear benefits of a targeted selection within this practical-driven approach. Especially imputation of low-frequency markers benefits from the combined approach described here. Accuracy was increased by up to 12% compared to a randomized or exclusively haplotype-based selection of sequencing candidates.	0
35126349	Maternal Nutrition During Late Gestation and Lactation: Association With Immunity and the Inflammatory Response in the Offspring.	The immature immune system at birth and environmental stress increase the risk of infection in nursing pigs. Severe infection subsequently induces intestinal and respiratory diseases and even cause death of pigs. The nutritional and physiological conditions of sows directly affect the growth, development and disease resistance of the fetus and newborn. Many studies have shown that providing sows with nutrients such as functional oligosaccharides, oils, antioxidants, and trace elements could regulate immunity and the inflammatory response of piglets. Here, we reviewed the positive effects of certain nutrients  on milk quality, immunoglobulin inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and intestinal microflora of sows, and further discuss the effects of these nutrients on immunity and the inflammatory response in the offspring.	0
35109833	Novel multifunctional robotically assisted bipolar instrument for simultaneous radiofrequency sealing and transection: preclinical and single-center experience.	BACKGROUND: A novel robotic-assisted bipolar radiofrequency (RF) multifunctional  vessel seal-and-transection instrument (SynchroSeal, Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) has been developed. The objective of the current paper is to describe the design of SynchroSeal based on bench studies, assess the safety of SynchroSeal in ex vivo and in vivo porcine studies, and provide early clinical context. METHODS: SynchroSeal grasping, energy activation time, and jaw temperature were evaluated with those of the Harmonic Ace+7. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, with Mann-Whitney for comparisons and statistical significance p < 0.05. Ex vivo and in vivo animal safety assessments of tissue after SynchroSeal use were evaluated for burst pressure, thermal spread, and acute sealing. Last, a single-center analysis of the technical metrics of SynchroSeal and Vessel Sealer  Extend (robotically assisted seal-and-transection instrument) in bariatric cases  is provided. RESULTS: Bench studies of SynchroSeal and Harmonic Ace+7 evidenced SynchroSeal's  greater slip resistance force (8.4 ± 1.0 vs. 3.1 ± 0.4 N; p = 0.0002), lower grip pressure (3.0 ± 0.2 vs. 4.2 ± 0.5 kg/cm2; p = 0.0002), faster seal time (1.5 ± 0.4 vs. 11.6 ± 2.5 s; p < 0.0001), lower mean jaw temperature (109.7 ± 7.2 vs. 247.4 ± 8.6 °C; p = 0.0051), and faster cooling to 40 °C (53.6 ± 2.1 vs. 68.0 ± 3.5 s; p = 0.0051). SynchroSeal's mean burst pressures after seal-and-transection and seal only modes were, respectively, 1169.1 ± 393.1 mmHg  and 1159.2 ± 454.6 mmHg. Mean thermal spreads were, respectively, 1.2 ± 0.6 mm and 1.5 ± 0.55 mm. In the chronic animal study, 102 vessels were sealed; at 3 weeks post-procedure, there was no evidence of leakage or adverse events, such  as non-target tissue thermal spread or tissue damage. In bariatrics cases, SynchroSeal was activated more frequently per case; however, its mean activation  time was significantly shorter than Vessel Sealer Extend. No adverse events were  reported for either device. CONCLUSIONS: SynchroSeal's multifunctional design provides enhanced sealing and transection capabilities with an acceptable safety profile.	0
35271886	A noval strategy of deletion in PK gene for construction of a vaccine candidate with exellent safety and complete protection efficiency against high virulent Chinese pseudorabies virus variant.	A variant of pseudorabies virus (PRV) with enhanced pathogenicity have emerged in many vaccinated swine herds in China since 2011. PRVΔTK&gE-AH02, a previously described TK/gE deletion PRV strain arising from the PRV variant AH02LA, has been shown to be safe for PRV antibody positive piglets, and could provide protection  against emerging PRV variants. However, inoculation of PRVΔTK&gE-AH02 into PRV antibody negative neonatal piglets caused lethal infection. In the study, in order to attenuate the virulence of PRVΔTK&gE-AH02, an additional deletion of 1∼x223C13 bp of US3 (the serine/threonine kinase, PK) gene was performed to generate a TK/PK/gE deletion PRV variant (PRVΔTK&PK&gE-AH02). We found that the growth kinetics of PRVΔTK&PK&gE-AH02 was similar to that of PRVΔTK&gE-AH02. Mice  inoculated with PRVΔTK&PK&gE-AH02 in different dose (104.0∼x223C107.0 TCID50) survived and showed no observable clinical symptoms. No virus was detected in the brains or lungs of the mice inoculated with PRVΔTK&PK&gE-AH02. Moreover, mice inoculated with PRVΔTK&PK&gE-AH02 and PRVΔTK&gE-AH02 showed similar survival against virulent PRV AH02LA strain. Importantly, safety test showed no clinical symptoms in PRV antibody negative neonatal piglets that were intranasally inoculated with PRVΔTK&PK&gE-AH02 at a dose of 106.5 TCID50, indicating that the  virulence of PRVΔTK&PK&gE-AH02 was significantly mitigated. Piglets immunized with PRVΔTK&PK&gE-AH02 exhibited a high serum neutralization index. All piglets inoculated intramuscularly (I.M.) with 1 mL (105.0 TCID50) PRVΔTK&PK&gE-AH02 were completely protected against challenge intranasally (I.N.) with 2LD50 (106.5TCID50) PRV AH02LA strain. In summary, our results indicate that deletion of 1∼x223C13 bp of US3 (PK) can provide a useful way for further attenuation of PRV and the PRVΔTK&PK&gE-AH02 might be a promising vaccine candidate for controlling of the virulent PRV variants in China.	0
35425836	Spatiotemporal Analysis and Assessment of Risk Factors in Transmission of African Swine Fever Along the Major Pig Value Chain in Lao Cai Province, Vietnam.	African swine fever (ASF) is a contagious and lethal hemorrhagic disease with a case fatality rate approaching 100% in domestic pigs. The main objectives of this study were to describe the spatiotemporal analysis as well as to assess the potential risk factors along the pig value chain in Lao Cai province, Vietnam. A  total of 925 outbreaks were reported from 2019 to 2020. The three clusters (primary, secondary and 5th) were observed near the Chinese border. The most temporal clusters were detected between May and August during the study period. In addition, we evaluated the association between ASF outbreak locations to the nearest main roads and elevation. For ASF outbreak locations to the nearest main  roads, compared with the reference (<5,000 m), <1,000 m (10.22 times) and 1,000-2,000 m (1.98 times) were significantly higher occurrences of ASF. For elevation, compared to the reference (>1,500 m), the farm locations with <500 m (55.31 times) showed a significantly increased risk of ASF outbreaks. Farmers perceived that the highest risk of ASF transmission may come from collectors and  slaughterers, intermediaries inside and outside the commune, feed agents and maize agents in the commune, and pig retailers. Both commercial and household pig producers considered minimizing the number of people going in and out of pig stables and improving healthcare and husbandry procedures to be both very important and feasible. There is a need for compliance by all pig producers and other actors in the pig value chain to adopt biosecurity practices. Therefore, awareness, knowledge and understanding of infection and risks of ASF need to be improved. Veterinary officials at the provincial and district levels need to improve capacity and resources to perform laboratory analysis for ASF and need to coordinate with local actors on the control and prevention of ASF in the community.	0
35339768	Is serology a realistic approach for monitoring red deer tuberculosis in the field?	Tuberculosis (TB) is a zoonotic mycobacterial infection with great importance in  human health, animal production, and wildlife conservation. Although an ambitious eradication programme in cattle has been implemented for decades, TB-free status  has not yet been achieved in most of Spain, where animal TB persists in a multi-host system of domestic and wild hosts, including the red deer (Cervus elaphus). However, information on long time series and trends of TB prevalence in wildlife is scarce. The diagnosis of TB in wild red deer is often based on gross  pathology and bacteriological culture confirmation, although recently serological assays have been developed to detect anti- Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex (MTC) antibodies. Particularly, protein complex P22 has demonstrated to yield good specificity and sensitivity in the serological diagnosis of MTC for red deer, as well as cattle, goats, sheep, pigs, wild boar, and European badger. Thus, the objective of the present study was to compare the performance of the P22-ELISA with TB-compatible lesion detection, as well as to assess the potential application of each technique for determining spatiotemporal trends and risk factors of MTC infection in wild red deer from low and high TB prevalence areas of Spain over the last two decades. We tested 5095 sera from 13 wild populations  by indirect ELISA using P22 as antigen. Mean seroprevalence (13.22%, CI95: 12.32-14.18) was compared with the prevalence of macroscopic TB-compatible lesions (6.94%, CI95: 6.18-7.79). The results evidenced a poor agreement between  both techniques (K < 0.3), although generalized TB-lesions and anti-P22 antibodies showed a positive association (χ² = 9.054, P = 0.004). Consequently, TB-lesion based prevalence and seroprevalence cannot be considered as equivalent  for TB surveillance in red deer. Regarding the spatiotemporal trend of TB in red  deer in Spain, we observed a North-South gradient of TB occurrence [North: 1.23%  (CI95: 0.77-1.97) of TB-lesions and 12.55% (CI95: 10.91-14.41) of P22-ELISA; Centre: 7.10% (CI95: 6.04-8.33) and 8.74% (CI95: 7.57-10.08); South: 21.04% (CI95:17.81-24.69) and 23.09% (CI95: 19.73-26.84), respectively]. Overall, there  was a stability over time, with higher prevalence in adults belonging to densely  populated sites. We conclude that the P22-ELISA alone is not sufficiently reliable for TB surveillance in red deer at large spatiotemporal scales. Instead, we recommend combining gross pathology and P22-ELISA.	0
35395853	Prevalence of porcine parvovirus 1 through 7 (PPV1-PPV7) and co-factor association with PCV2 and PRRSV in Korea.	BACKGROUND: Classical porcine parvovirus (PPV1) and novel porcine parvoviruses designated porcine parvovirus 2 through 7 (PPV2-PPV7) are widespread in pig populations. The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence rates  of PPV1-PPV7 in Korea by detecting PPVs in serum, lung and fecal samples and to elucidate the association of PPVs with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV), major pathogens involved in porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). A total of 286 serum, 481 lung, and 281 fecal samples collected from 2018 to 2020 were analyzed. RESULTS: The results showed that PPVs are widespread in Korea; the highest detection rates were found in lung samples and ranged from 7.9% (PPV1) to 32.6% (PPV2). Regarding age groups, fattening pigs had the highest detection rates of PPVs, ranging from 6.4% (PPV1) to 36.5% (PPV6); this finding suggests the chronic nature of PPV infections and the continual circulation of these viruses. When compared with PCV2- and PRRSV-negative lung samples, PCV2-positive samples with or without PRRSV positivity had significantly higher detection levels of PPV1 and PPV6. In contrast, the prevalence of PPV2 and PPV7 was significantly higher in PRRSV-infected lung samples regardless of PCV2 detection. PPV5 was detected significantly more frequently in samples  with both PCV2 and PRRSV positivity. CONCLUSIONS: This study could offer a better understanding of the role of PPVs in PCV2 and/or PRRSV infection though further studies are needed to experimentally assess the impact of PPVs in coinfections.	0
35049984	Pneumocystis spp. in Pigs: A Longitudinal Quantitative Study and Co-Infection Assessment in Austrian Farms.	While Pneumocystis has been recognized as both a ubiquitous commensal fungus in immunocompetent mammalian hosts and a major opportunistic pathogen in humans responsible for severe pneumonias in immunocompromised patients, in pigs its epidemiology and association with pulmonary diseases have been rarely reported. Nevertheless, the fungus can be quite abundant in porcine populations with up to  51% of prevalence reported so far. The current study was undertaken to longitudinally quantify Pneumocystis carinii f. sp. suis and other pulmonary pathogens in a cohort of 50 pigs from five Austrian farms (i.e., 10 pigs per farm) with a history of respiratory disease at five time points between the first week and the fourth month of life. The fungus was present as early as the suckling period (16% and 26% of the animals in the first and the third week, respectively), yet not in a high amount. Over time, both the organism load (highest 4.4 × 105 copies/mL) and prevalence (up to 88% of positive animals in the third month) increased in each farm. The relative prevalence of various coinfection patterns was significantly different over time. The current study unravelled a complex co-infection history involving Pneumocystis and other pulmonary pathogens in pigs, suggesting a relevant role of the fungus in the respiratory disease scenario of this host.	0
35063043	Compositional analysis of the tonsil microbiota in relationship to Streptococcus  suis disease in nursery pigs in Ontario.	BACKGROUND: The tonsil of the soft palate in pigs is the colonization site of both commensal and pathogenic microbial agents. Streptococcus suis infections are a significant economic problem in the swine industry. The development of S. suis  disease remains poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to identify whether the tonsillar microbiota profile in nursery pigs is altered with S. suis  disease. Here, the dynamics of the tonsillar microbiota from 20 healthy pigs and  43 diseased pigs with S. suis clinical signs was characterized. RESULTS: Based on the presence or absence of S. suis in the systemic sites, diseased pigs were classified into confirmed (n = 20) or probable (n = 23) group, respectively. Microbiota composition was assessed using the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA, and results were analyzed to identify the diversity of the tonsillar microbiota. The taxonomic composition of the tonsil microbiota proved to be highly diverse between individuals, and the results showed statistically significant microbial community structure among the diagnosis groups. The confirmed group had the lowest observed species richness while the probable group had higher phylogenetics diversity level compared to the healthy group. Un-weighted Unifrac also demonstrated that the probable group had a higher beta diversity than both the healthy and the confirmed group. A Dirichlet-multinomial mixture (DMM) model-based clustering method partitioned the tonsil microbiota into two distinct community types that did not correspond with  disease status. However, there was an association between Streptococcus suis serotype 2 and DMM community type 1 (p = 0.03). ANCOM-BC identified 24 Streptococcus amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) that were differentially abundant between the DMM community types. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the structure and membership of the tonsil microbiota in nursery pigs and uncovers differences and  similarities across varying S. suis disease status. While the overall abundance of Streptococcus was not different among the diagnosis groups, the unique profile of DMM community type 1 and the observed correlation with S. suis serotype 2 could provide insight into potential tonsillar microbiota involvement in S. suis  disease.	0
35034641	Mapping short tandem repeats for liver gene expression traits helps prioritize potential causal variants for complex traits in pigs.	BACKGROUND: Short tandem repeats (STRs) were recently found to have significant impacts on gene expression and diseases in humans, but their roles on gene expression and complex traits in pigs remain unexplored. This study investigates  the effects of STRs on gene expression in liver tissues based on the whole-genome sequences and RNA-Seq data of a discovery cohort of 260 F6 individuals and a validation population of 296 F7 individuals from a heterogeneous population generated from crosses among eight pig breeds. RESULTS: We identified 5203 and 5868 significantly expression STRs (eSTRs, FDR < 1%) in the F6 and F7 populations, respectively, most of which could be reciprocally validated (π1 = 0.92). The eSTRs explained 27.5% of the cis-heritability of gene expression traits on average. We further identified 235  and 298 fine-mapped STRs through the Bayesian fine-mapping approach in the F6 and F7 pigs, respectively, which were significantly enriched in intron, ATAC peak, compartment A and H3K4me3 regions. We identified 20 fine-mapped STRs located in 100 kb windows upstream and downstream of published complex trait-associated SNPs, which colocalized with epigenetic markers such as H3K27ac and ATAC peaks. These included eSTR of the CLPB, PGLS, PSMD6 and DHDH genes, which are linked with genome-wide association study (GWAS) SNPs for blood-related traits, leg conformation, growth-related traits, and meat quality traits, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insights into the effects of STRs on gene expression traits. The identified eSTRs are valuable resources for prioritizing causal STRs for complex traits in pigs.	0
35428319	Mitochondrial supplementation of Sus scrofa metaphase II oocytes alters DNA methylation and gene expression profiles of blastocysts.	BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number in oocytes correlates with oocyte quality and fertilisation outcome. The introduction of additional copies of mtDNA through mitochondrial supplementation of mtDNA-deficient Sus scrofa oocytes resulted in: (1) improved rates of fertilisation; (2) increased mtDNA copy number in the 2-cell stage embryo; and (3) improved development of the embryo to the blastocyst stage. Furthermore, a subset of genes showed changes in  gene expression. However, it is still unknown if mitochondrial supplementation alters global and local DNA methylation patterns during early development. RESULTS: We generated a series of embryos in a model animal, Sus scrofa, by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and mitochondrial supplementation in combination with ICSI (mICSI). The DNA methylation status of ICSI- and mICSI-derived blastocysts was analysed by whole genome bisulfite sequencing. At a global level, the additional copies of mtDNA did not affect nuclear DNA methylation profiles of blastocysts, though over 2000 local genomic regions exhibited differential levels of DNA methylation. In terms of the imprinted genes, DNA methylation patterns were conserved in putative imprint control regions; and the gene expression profile of these genes and genes involved in embryonic genome activation were not affected by mitochondrial supplementation. However, 52 genes showed significant differences in expression as demonstrated by RNAseq analysis. The affected gene networks involved haematological system development and function, tissue morphology and cell cycle. Furthermore, seven mtDNA-encoded t-RNAs were downregulated in mICSI-derived blastocysts suggesting that extra copies of mtDNA affected tRNA processing and/or turnover, hence protein synthesis in blastocysts. We also showed a potential association between  differentially methylated regions and changes in expression for 55 genes due to mitochondrial supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of just an extra ~ 800 copies of mtDNA into oocytes can have a significant impact on both gene expression and DNA methylation profiles in Sus scrofa blastocysts by altering the epigenetic programming established during  oogenesis. Some of these changes may affect specific tissue-types later in life.  Consequently, it is important to determine the longitudinal effect of these molecular changes on growth and development before considering human clinical practice.	0
35181733	Identification of candidate genes that specifically regulate subcutaneous and intramuscular fat deposition using transcriptomic and proteomic profiles in Dingyuan pigs.	Subcutaneous fat and intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition are closely related to meat production and pork quality. Dingyuan pig, as a native pig breed in China, low selection leads to obvious genetic and phenotypic differences in the population. Individuals with extreme fat content in the population are ideal models for studying the mechanism of fat deposition. In this study, we used RNA-Seq and tandem mass tags-based (TMT) proteomics to analyze the key pathways and genes that specifically regulate subcutaneous fat and IMF deposition in Dingyuan pigs. We identified 191 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 61 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in the high and low back fat thickness (HBF, LBF) groups, 85 DEGs and 12 DAPs were obtained in the high and low intramuscular fat (HIMF, LIMF) groups. The functional analysis showed that the DEGs and DAPs in the backfat groups were mainly involved in carbohydrates, amino  acids, and fatty acids metabolism, whereas the IMF groups were involved in the insulin pathway, longevity, and some disease-related pathways. We found 40 candidate genes that might tissue-specifically lipids deposition for subcutaneous and intramuscular fat. Our research provides theoretical reference materials for  the improvement of fat deposition traits of local pig breeds in my country.	0
35445110	High stillbirth rate in a swine farm in Vietnam and associated risk factors.	Objective: The information about risk factors for a high stillbirth rate in piglets is inadequate. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine important risk factors for an extremely high stillbirth rate in a commercial pig farm in Vietnam. Materials and Methods: This study included 628 piglets and 45 Landrace × Yorkshire sows. Data including parity number, gestation length (GL), litter size  (LS), piglet's gender, stillbirth, birth order, birth interval (BI), cumulative farrowing duration (CFD), birth weight (BW), crown-rump length (CRL), body mass index, and ponderal index (PI) were collected. To deal with hierarchical data where several piglets might be born from a sow, Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) were used to examine the association between stillbirth and investigated  risk factors. Results: The stillbirth rate was 14.3%, and the incidence of stillbirth at the litter level was 68.9%. The final multivariate GLMM selected eight factors, including CFD, BI, CRL, BW, PI, GL, LS, and parity, as significant risk factors for stillbirth in the piglet. CFD >90 min, BI > 30 min, CRL <25 cm, BW <1.0 kg, PI <50, GL <114 days, LS >13, and parity 5-8 were associated with increased stillbirth. The final model explained 50.1% of the variation of stillbirth, in which fixed factors explained 43.6% of the variation. Conclusion: The present study indicated that the stillbirth rate in the investigated pig farm was very high, and several factors simultaneously contributed to the situation. Selection for optimal size and shape of piglets, careful supervision of parturition, and replacement of old sows should be some of the practical approaches to reduce the stillbirth rate.	0
35018454	Effects of increased ambient temperature and supplemental altrenogest before pregnancy establishment in gilts.	Heat stress (HS) mitigation strategies are critically needed to combat the substantial economic effects on animal agriculture. The manifestations of seasonal infertility include delayed puberty onset, reduced conception rates, decreased litter size, and increased wean to estrus interval. To assess the effects of HS during early gestation and evaluate the benefit of supplemental altrenogest (ALT) as a mitigation strategy, 30 crossbred postpubertal gilts (157 ± 11 kg body weight) were subjected to estrous synchronization via 14 d oral administration of ALT. Artificial insemination during estrus was performed, and gilts were then placed into one of four treatment groups: HS (35 ± 1 °C for 12 h/31.60 ± 1 °C for 12 h) with (HSALT, n = 7) or without (HSCON, n = 7) 15 mg/d ALT supplementation or thermal neutral (TN; 20 ± 1 °C) conditions with (TNALT, n = 8) or without (TNCON, n = 8) 15 mg/d ALT supplementation until 12 d post-estrus (dpe). Administrating ALT occurred at 0600 hours from 3 to 12 dpe, and rectal temperatures (TR) and respiration rates (RR) were recorded. Blood was  collected via jugular venipuncture on 0, 4, 8, and 12 dpe. Gilts were euthanized  humanely at 12 dpe followed by the collection of ovarian tissue, and uterine flushing for conceptus collection. In HS compared with TN gilts, RR and TR were increased (P < 0.01) but unaffected by ALT supplementation. Feed intake was reduced (P < 0.01) by HS but unaltered by the ALT treatment. Corpora lutea (CL) weight was reduced (P < 0.01) in HSCON gilts when compared with TNCON and HSALT gilts despite progesterone concentrations in serum and luteal tissue not being affected by treatment (P ≥ 0.10). CL diameter was reduced (P ≤ 0.05) in HSALT gilts compared with other treatments. Interleukin-1β (IL1B) uterine flush concentration was not affected (P > 0.20) by environment or ALT supplementation,  although moderate (P = 0.06) interaction between environment and ALT existed, as  IL1B concentration in TNALT was increased (P = 0.03) compared with TNCON gilts. While environment did not affect conceptus development (P = 0.90), ALT supplementation advanced conceptus elongation (P < 0.01). Collectively, these data demonstrate that HS may affect luteal development before pregnancy establishment, and ALT increases conceptus elongation by 12 dpe.	0
35441964	Discovery and synthesis of 1,2,4-oxadiazole derivatives as novel inhibitors of Zika, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and classical swine fever virus infections.	Zika virus (ZIKV), an arbovirus of the Flaviviridae family, has emerged as a significant public health concern owing to its association with congenital abnormalities and severe neurological sequelae. Thus, there is an urgent need to  develop effective therapeutic approaches to efficiently treat ZIKV infections. This study used phenotypic screening to identify a series of 1,2,4-oxadiazole derivatives that possess antiviral activity against ZIKV infection. Subsequently, 28 new derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for this purpose. Among these compounds, 4-(5-phenyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-N-(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)aniline (5d) had potent antiviral activity against ZIKV infections. Furthermore, a structure-activity relationship analysis indicated that a benzyl substitution on the aniline nitrogen of this compound improved potency while augmenting its drug-like properties. In addition, 5d exhibited antiviral activity against various viruses  of Flaviviridae family of worldwide public health importance, such as dengue, Japanese encephalitis and classical swine fever viruses, indicating its potential as a lead compound for generating 1,2,4-oxadiazole derivatives with broad-spectrum anti-flaviviral properties.	0
35158711	Single-Step GBLUP and GWAS Analyses Suggests Implementation of Unweighted Two Trait Approach for Heat Stress in Swine.	The purpose of this study was to perform a genome-wide association study to determine the genomic regions associated with heat stress tolerance in swine. Phenotypic information on carcass weight was available for 227,043 individuals from commercial farms in North Carolina and Missouri, U.S. Individuals were from  a commercial cross of a Duroc sire and a dam resulting from a Landrace and Large  White cross. Genotypic information was available for 8232 animals with 33,581 SNPs. The pedigree file contained a total of 553,448 animals. A threshold of 78 on the Temperature Humidity Index (THI) was used to signify heat stress. A two-trait analysis was used with the phenotypes heat stress (Trait One) and non-heat stress (Trait Two). Variance components were calculated via AIREML and breeding values were calculated using single step GBLUP (ssGBLUP). The heritability for Traits One and Two were calculated at 0.25 and 0.20, respectively, and the genetic correlation was calculated as 0.63. Validation was  calculated for 163 genotyped sires with progeny in the last generation. The benchmark was the GEBV with complete data, and the accuracy was determined as the correlation between the GEBV of the reduced and complete data for the validation  sires. Weighted ssGBLUP did not increase the accuracies. Both methods showed a maximum accuracy of 0.32 for Trait One and 0.54 for Trait Two. Manhattan Plots for Trait One, Trait Two, and the difference between the two were created from the results of the two-trait analysis. Windows explaining more than 0.8% of the genetic variance were isolated. Chromosomes 1 and 14 showed peaks in the difference between the two traits. The genetic correlation suggests a different mechanism for Hot Carcass Weight under heat stress. The GWAS results show that both traits are highly polygenic, with only a few genomic regions explaining more than 1% of variance.	0
35131553	Porcine iucA+ but rmpA- Klebsiella pneumoniae strains proliferate in blood of young piglets but are killed by IgM and complement dependent opsonophagocytosis when these piglets get older.	Klebsiella (K.) pneumoniae causes different diseases in humans and animals including the life-threatening liver abscess syndrome and septicemia, respectively. However, host-pathogen interactions of K. pneumoniae in porcine blood have not been studied. We investigated the working hypothesis that only distinct K. pneumoniae strains have the capacity to survive in porcine blood and  that this feature is associated with specific molecular markers such as sequence  type, profile of siderophore genes and the regulator of the mucoid phenotype (rmp). Furthermore, we characterize the immune response in growing piglets leading to killing of an invasive K. pneumoniae strain. The veterinary isolates showed great diversity in sequence types and profile of siderophore genes. Porcine isolates were mainly positive for the aerobactin gene iucA but did not carry rmpA and this genotype was associated with proliferation in blood of 4-week-old piglets. Supernatants of an iucA+ but not an iucA- strain boosted growth in porcine serum. Between four and eight weeks of age, piglets showed a prominent increase of IgM binding to K. pneumoniae. Immunglobulin M and complement were crucial for killing of a serum-resistant iucA+ porcine K. pneumoniae strain at eight weeks of age. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed induction of phagocytosis and oxidative burst mediated by serum samples of 8-week-old piglets. Based on our in vitro findings we propose that many porcine iucA+ rmpA- K. pneumoniae strains have the ability to cause bacteremia in young piglets in association with aerobactin-mediated iron acquisition and that this phenotype is lost as specific IgM increases after weaning.	0
34899686	The Role of Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide and Mast Cells in the Regulatory Effect of Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393 on Intestinal Mucosal Immune Barrier.	Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) plays an important role in the neuro-endocrine-immune system. Mast cells (MCs) are important immune effector cells. This study was conducted to investigate the protective effect of L. casei  ATCC 393 on Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) K88-induced intestinal mucosal immune barrier injury and its association with VIP/MC signaling by in vitro experiments in cultures of porcine mucosal mast cells (PMMCs) and in vivo experiments using VIP receptor antagonist (aVIP) drug. The results showed that compared with the ETEC K88 and lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced model groups, VIP pretreatment significantly inhibited the activation of MCs and the release of β-hexosaminidase (β-hex), histamine and tryptase. Pretreatment with aVIP abolished the protective effect of L. casei ATCC 393 on ETEC K88-induced intestinal mucosal immune barrier dysfunction in C57BL/6 mice. Also, with the blocking of VIP signal transduction, the ETEC K88 infection increased serum inflammatory cytokines, and the numbers of degranulated MCs in ileum, which were  decreased by administration of L. casei ATCC 393. In addition, VIP mediated the regulatory effect of L. casei ATCC 393 on intestinal microbiota in mice. These findings suggested that VIP may mediate the protective effect of L.casei ATCC 393 on intestinal mucosal immune barrier dysfunction via MCs.	0
35249015	A Therapeutic Extracorporeal Device for Specific Removal of Pathologic Asymmetric Dimethylarginine from the Blood.	INTRODUCTION: Blood levels of uremic toxin, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), are strongly associated with mortality in sepsis, renal failure, and cardiovascular and renal disease patients. METHODS: An extracorporeal approach to reduce pathological ADMA was developed. The dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) was immobilized on agarose beads to prepare a cartridge. The efficacy of cartridge for ADMA lowering in blood was investigated. RESULTS: The DDAH beads and cartridge reduced ADMA from solution or plasma. The magnitude of ADMA removal was dependent on the quantity of DDAH linked to the beads and the flow rate. When tested in association with plasmapheresis, the DDAH-cartridge was highly effective in ADMA removal from the blood and improved the arginine/ADMA ratio in a pig model. CONCLUSION: A new, safe, and effective extracorporeal approach to lower ADMA was  developed which may have application in improving outcomes in patients with vascular complications and risk of mortality associated with high ADMA.	0
35410533	"The ""ideal protein"" concept is not ideal in animal nutrition."	"Amino acids (AAs) are required for syntheses of proteins and low-molecular-weight substances with enormous physiological importance. Since 1912, AAs have been classified as nutritionally essential amino acids (EAAs) or nonessential amino acids (NEAAs) for animals. EAAs are those AAs that are either not synthesized or  insufficiently synthesized de novo in the organisms. It was assumed that all NEAAs (now known as AAs that are synthesizable in animal cells de novo [AASAs]) were formed sufficiently in animals and were not needed in diets. However, studies over the past three decades have shown that sufficient dietary AASAs (e.g. glutamine, glutamate, glycine, and proline) are necessary for the maximum growth and optimum health of pigs, chickens, and fish. Thus, the concept of ""ideal protein"" (protein with an optimal EAA pattern that precisely meets the physiological needs of animals), which was originally proposed in the 1950s but ignored AASAs, is not ideal in animal nutrition. Ideal diets must provide all physiologically and nutritionally essential AAs. Improved patterns of AAs in diets for swine and chickens as well as zoo and companion animals have been proposed in recent years. Animal-sourced feedstuffs supply abundant EAAs and AASAs (including glutamate, glutamine, glycine, proline, 4-hydroxyproline, and taurine) for diets of swine, poultry, fish, and crustaceans to improve their growth, development, reproduction, and health, while sustaining global animal production. Nutritionists should move beyond the ""ideal protein"" concept to consider optimum ratios and amounts of all proteinogenic AAs in diets for mammals, birds, and aquatic animals, and, in the case of carnivores, also taurine."	0
35308386	The Construction and Immunogenicity Analyses of Recombinant Pseudorabies Virus With NADC30-Like Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus-Like Particles Co-expression.	Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) and pseudorabies (PR) are highly infectious swine diseases and cause significant financial loss in China. The respiratory system and reproductive system are the main target systems. Previous studies showed that the existing PR virus (PRV) and PRRS virus (PRRSV) commercial vaccines could not provide complete protection against PRV variant strains and NADC30-like PRRSV strains in China. In this study, the PRV variant strain XJ and NADC30-like PRRSV strain CHSCDJY-2019 are used as the parent for constructing a recombinant pseudorabies virus (rPRV)-NC56 with gE/gI/TK gene deletion and co-expressing NADC30-like PRRSV GP5 and M protein. The rPRV-NC56 proliferated stably in BHK-21 cells, and it could stably express GP5 and M protein. Due to the introduction of the self-cleaving 2A peptide, GP5 and M protein were able to express independently and form virus-like particles (VLPs) of PRRSV in rPRV-NC56-infected BHK-21 cells. The rPRV-NC56 is safe for use in mice; it can colonize and express the target protein in mouse lungs for a long time. Vaccination with rPRV-NC56 induces PRV and NADC30-like PRRSV specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, and protects 100% of mice from virulent PRV XJ strain. Furthermore, the virus-neutralizing antibody (VNA) elicited by rPRV-NC56 showed significantly lower titer against SCNJ-2016 (HP-PRRSV) than that against CHSCDJY-2019 (NADC30-like PRRSV). Thus, rPRV-NC56 appears to be a promising candidate vaccine against NADC30-like PRRSV and PRV for the control and eradication of the variant PRV and NADC30-like PRRSV.	0
35130864	Hepatitis E seroprevalence and risk factors in humans and pig in Ghana.	BACKGROUND: Although Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection has significant negative impact on the health and wellbeing of underprivileged populations, the burden of  HEV in Ghana is still unclear, despite widespread water, sanitation, and hygiene  (WASH) related conditions that predispose people to the risk of infection. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to explore rates of HEV seroprevalence and HEV prevalence, as well as risk factors in humans and domestic pigs in Ghana. These were determined using ELISAs manufactured by Wantai Beijing  Biopharmaceuticals, China. The study involved 1365 community members, 105 pig farmers and 474 domestic pigs from four administrative regions of Ghana. RESULTS: Results showed overall seroprevalence and prevalence of 12.4% and 0.7% in community members and 15.2% and 2.9% in pig farmers respectively. There was no significant difference in the seroprevalence between the two groups (Z = 0.851; p = 0.3953). However, the prevalence in pig farmers was significantly higher than in community members (Z = 2.412; p = 0.016). Age (OR = 1.369, CI = 1.243 - 1.508; p = 0.0000), gender (OR = 1.419, CI = 1.101 - 1.991; p = 0.043), and the region of residence (OR = 1.569, CI = 1.348 - 1.827; p = 0.0000) were significant risk factors for HEV seroprevalence in a multivariate regression model. In pigs, overall seroprevalence and prevalence of 62.4% and 5.5% were recorded respectively. A significant difference in seroprevalence was found between confined (6.7%) and free-range pigs (88.3%), (Z = 7.492; p < 0.00001) in the Volta Region. Multivariate logistic regression showed a significant association between seroprevalence and husbandry (OR = 7.051, CI = 3.558- 13.972; p = 0.0000) and region (OR = 4.602, CI = 2.300 - 9.205; p = 0.0000) in pigs in the Volta and  Greater Accra Region. CONCLUSION: From this study, HEV is endemic in Ghana with high seroprevalence in  humans and pig populations. This underscores the need for awareness creation and  action for prevention and control.	0
35175184	Acquired haemophilia A: Italian Consensus Recommendations on diagnosis, general management and treatment of bleeding.	BACKGROUND: Acquired haemophilia A (AHA) is a rare bleeding disorder due to autoantibodies to coagulation factor VIII that may be secondary to autoimmune diseases, cancer, drugs, pregnancy, infections, or be idiopathic. Recurrent bleeding, often severe, mostly in muscles and soft tissues, and isolated prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), in the absence of personal and family history of bleeding, are typical features that should raise the suspicion of AHA. Poor awareness of the disease results in diagnostic delays  and inappropriate treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Italian Association of Haemophilia Centres (AICE) developed consensus recommendations in cooperation with the Italian Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (SISET). The document was shared with scientific societies of specialist physicians, laboratory professionals and pharmacists to spread knowledge about AHA and promote appropriate diagnosis/treatment. RESULTS: Ready availability of the aPTT mixing test is crucial, although diagnostic confirmation and optimal management require prompt referral of patients to specialised centres with rapidly available diagnostic and therapeutic facilities. If immediate referral is unfeasible, treatment must be undertaken early, under guidance of specialised centres or based on shared protocols. Recommendations about diagnosis, general management and, in bleeding patients, haemostatic therapy using bypassing agents or replacement treatment, including the recently available recombinant porcine factor VIII, are provided, considering the different clinical settings and laboratory facilities. DISCUSSION: This consensus document aims to improve the overall healthcare pathways for AHA, harmonise the management and therapeutic approaches to newly diagnosed patients and reduce the still relevant complications and mortality in this setting.	0
35167316	Host Genetic Determinants of the Microbiome Across Animals: From Caenorhabditis elegans to Cattle.	Animals harbor diverse communities of microbes within their gastrointestinal tracts. Phylogenetic relationship, diet, gut morphology, host physiology, and ecology all influence microbiome composition within and between animal clades. Emerging evidence points to host genetics as also playing a role in determining gut microbial composition within species. Here, we discuss recent advances in the study of microbiome heritability across a variety of animal species. Candidate gene and discovery-based studies in humans, mice, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, cattle, swine, poultry, and baboons reveal trends in the types of microbes that are heritable and the host genes and pathways involved in shaping the microbiome. Heritable gut microbes within a host species tend to be phylogenetically restricted. Host genetic variation in immune- and growth-related genes drives the abundances of these heritable bacteria within the gut. With only a small slice of the metazoan branch of the tree of life explored to date, this is an area rife with opportunities to shed light into the mechanisms governing host-microbe relationships.	0
35276872	Fructooligosaccharide Reduces Weanling Pig Diarrhea in Conjunction with Improving Intestinal Antioxidase Activity and Tight Junction Protein Expression.	This study was to illustrate the effects of fructooligosaccharide (FOS) on the antioxidant capacity, intestinal barrier function, and microbial community of weanling pigs. Results showed that FOS reduced the incidence of diarrhea (6.5 vs. 10.8%) of pigs (p &lt; 0.05) but did not affect growth performance when compared  with the control group. A diet supplemented with FOS increased ileal mRNA expression of occludin (1.7 vs. 1.0), claudin-1 (1.9 vs. 1.0), claudin-2 (1.8 vs. 1.0), and claudin-4 (1.7 vs. 1.0), as well as colonic mRNA expression of ZO-1 (1.6 vs. 1.0), claudin-1 (1.7 vs. 1.0), occludin (1.9 vs. 1.0), and pBD-1 (1.5 vs. 1.0) when compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.05). FOS supplementation  improved the anti-oxidase activity and expression of nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2), and decreased concentrations of D-lactate (3.05 U/L vs.  2.83 U/L) and TNF-α (59.1 pg/mL vs. 48.0 pg/mL) in the serum when compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, FOS increased Sharpea, Megasphaera, and Bacillus populations in the gut when compared with the control group (p &lt;  0.05). Association analysis indicated that mRNA expression of occludin and claudin-1 in the ileal mucosa were correlated positively with populations of Sharpea and Bacillus (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, mRNA expression of occludin and  claudin-1 in the colonic mucosa were correlated positively with abundances of Sharpea, Lactobocillus, and Bifidobacterium (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, FOS activated Nrf2 signaling and increased the expression of specific tight junction  proteins, which were associated with reduced diarrhea incidence.	0
35317113	Recombinant hemagglutinin of swine H1N1 influenza virus expression in the insect  cells: Formulation in Montanide ISA71 adjuvant and the potency studies.	Objectives: Influenza is a highly contagious disease, which affects the respiratory system and seasonal influenza is common throughout the world. Influenza vaccination is an effective way to reduce the risk of death and hospitalization. This study aims at the expression of swine recombinant hemagglutinin protein in the baculovirus expression system and it offers a comparison of the immunologic parameters with the commercial vaccine. Materials and Methods: The HA gene from the swine H1N1 strain of the Influenza virus was cloned into the Bac-To-Bac expression system in pFastBAC HTA vector and was transformed into Escherichia coli TOP10 strain. After the confirmation, the vector was transfected into the SF9 insect cell line. The recombinant HA was evaluated by SDS-PAGE and western blot. After formulation in Montanide ISA71 adjuvant, the immunization test was performed comparatively with Alum adjuvant, commercial vaccine in four groups of BALB/c mice, of which one group was control  without any vaccination. Two weeks after the last immunization, the antibody response was assessed with HI assay, and experimental mice were challenged with mouse-adapted Influenza A/PR8/34 (H1N1) virus through nasal inhalation. Results: The immunoassay results revealed that the candidate vaccine induced the  antibody response as the commercial one did but it did not significantly reduce the mortality rate, body loss, and severe fever. Conclusion: To summarize, the results showed that the recombinant protein with the MontanideTM ISA- 71 adjuvant developed a more appropriate level of immunity than Alum adjuvant, so it might be used as a safe and reliable vaccine against H1N1 virus for further research.	0
35386394	Whole-genome analysis reveals the hybrid formation of Chinese indigenous DHB pig  following human migration.	Hybridization is widespread in nature and is a valuable tool in domestic breeding. The DHB (DaHuaBai) pig in South China is the product of such a breeding strategy, resulting in increased body weight compared with other pigs in the surrounding area. We analyzed genomic data from 20 Chinese pig breeds and investigated the genomic architecture after breed formation of DHB. The breed showed inconsistency in genotype and body weight phenotype, in line with selection after hybridization. By quantifying introgression with a haplotype-based approach, we proposed a two-step introgression from large-sized pigs into small-sized pigs to produce DHB, consistent with the human migration events in Chinese history. Combining with gene prioritization and allele frequency analysis, we identify candidate genes that showed selection after introgression and that may affect body weight, such as IGF1R, SRC, and PCM1. Our  research provides an example of a hybrid formation of domestic breeds along with  human migration patterns.	0
35061545	Transient Cell Cycle Induction in Cardiomyocytes to Treat Subacute Ischemic Heart Failure.	BACKGROUND: The regenerative capacity of the heart after myocardial infarction is limited. Our previous study showed that ectopic introduction of 4 cell cycle factors (4F; CDK1 [cyclin-dependent kinase 1], CDK4 [cyclin-dependent kinase 4],  CCNB [cyclin B1], and CCND [cyclin D1]) promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation in 15% to 20% of infected cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo and improves cardiac function after myocardial infarction in mice. METHODS: Using temporal single-cell RNA sequencing, we aimed to identify the necessary reprogramming stages during the forced cardiomyocyte proliferation with 4F on a single cell basis. Using rat and pig models of ischemic heart failure, we aimed to start the first preclinical testing to introduce 4F gene therapy as a candidate for the treatment of ischemia-induced heart failure. RESULTS: Temporal bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing and further biochemical validations of mature human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes  treated with either LacZ or 4F adenoviruses revealed full cell cycle reprogramming in 15% of the cardiomyocyte population at 48 hours after infection  with 4F, which was associated mainly with sarcomere disassembly and metabolic reprogramming (n=3/time point/group). Transient overexpression of 4F, specifically in cardiomyocytes, was achieved using a polycistronic nonintegrating lentivirus (NIL) encoding 4F; each is driven by a TNNT2 (cardiac troponin T isoform 2) promoter (TNNT2-4Fpolycistronic-NIL). TNNT2-4Fpolycistronic-NIL or control virus was injected intramyocardially 1 week after myocardial infarction in rats (n=10/group) or pigs (n=6-7/group). Four weeks after injection, TNNT2-4Fpolycistronic-NIL-treated animals showed significant improvement in left  ventricular ejection fraction and scar size compared with the control virus-treated animals. At 4 months after treatment, rats that received TNNT2-4Fpolycistronic-NIL still showed a sustained improvement in cardiac function and no obvious development of cardiac arrhythmias or systemic tumorigenesis (n=10/group). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides mechanistic insights into the process of forced  cardiomyocyte proliferation and advances the clinical feasibility of this approach by minimizing the oncogenic potential of the cell cycle factors owing to the use of a novel transient and cardiomyocyte-specific viral construct.	0
34914964	Transcription factor Sp2 promotes TGFB-mediated interstitial cell osteogenic differentiation in bicuspid aortic valves through a SMAD-dependent pathway.	Calcification of the bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) involves differential expression of various RNA genes, which is achieved through complex regulatory networks that  are controlled in part by transcription factors and microRNAs. We previously found that miR-195-5p regulates the osteogenic differentiation of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) by targeting the TGF-β pathway. However, the transcriptional regulation of miR-195-5p in calcified BAV patients is not yet clear. In this study, stenotic aortic valve tissues from patients with BAVs and tricuspid aortic valves (TAVs) were collected. Candidate transcription factors of miR-195-5p were predicted by bioinformatics analysis and tested in diseased valves and in male porcine VICs. SP2 gene expression and the corresponding protein levels in BAV were significantly lower than those in TAV, and a low SP2 expression level environment in VICs resulted in remarkable increases in RNA expression levels of RUNX2, BMP2, collagen 1, MMP2, and MMP9 and the corresponding proteins. ChIP assays revealed that SP2 directly bound to the transcription promoter region of miR-195-5p. Cotransfection of SP2 shRNA and a miR-195-5p mimic in porcine VICs demonstrated that SP2 repressed SMAD7 expression via miR-195-5p, while knockdown of SP2 increased the mRNA expression of SMAD7 and the corresponding protein and attenuated Smad 2/3 expression. Immunofluorescence  staining of diseased valves confirmed that the functional proteins of osteogenesis differentiation, including RUNX2, BMP2, collagen 1, and osteocalcin, were overexpressed in BAVs. In Conclusion, the transcription factor Sp2 is expressed at low levels in VICs from BAV patients, which has a negative impact on miR-195-5p expression by binding its promoter region and partially promotes calcification through a SMAD-dependent pathway.	0
35282397	Incidence of dystocia at piglet level in cloprostenol-induced farrowings and associated risk factors.	Few studies have investigated risk factors for dystocia in swine, although this birthing abnormality can compromise welfare of both sows and piglets by increasing stillbirth rate and decreasing sow productivity. This study aimed to determine risk factors associated with dystocia at piglet level in cloprostenol-induced farrowings. A dystocia event was recorded when a birth interval exceeded 45  min or when manual extraction was applied. Data were collected from 898 piglets born from 77 Landrace × Yorkshire crossbred sows, which were induced for farrowing on day 114 of gestation. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were used to evaluate the association between dystocia and parity, gestation length, litter size, relative birth order (RBO (%)  =  100  ⋅  birth order/litter size), birth weight, crown rump length, body mass index, ponderal index, piglet's sex, use of oxytocin, and stillbirth. Sows nested in farrowing batches were fitted as random factors in GLMMs. Incidence of dystocia at piglet and farrowing levels was 11.0 % and 75.3 %, respectively. The final multivariate model explained 20.1 % variation of dystocia. RBO had a quadratic effect on dystocia in which incidence of dystocia decreased from RBO  ≤  40 % to  RBO  =  60 %-70 %, and then increased to the end of parturition. Piglets with birth weight  >  1700  g and stillborn piglets had higher odds of dystocia in comparison with piglets with a birth weight of 900-1700  g (OR  =  2.63; 95 % CI  =  1.66-4.18) and live-born piglets (OR  =  2.62; 95 % CI  =  1.12-6.15), respectively. This study indicates that dystocia is very common in cloprostenol-induced farrowings and suggests that the last one-third of parturitions is the most important stage to be supervised, and selection for homogenous litters and moderate high birth weight may reduce the rate of dystocia.	0
35052905	Comparison of Consumption Data and Phenotypical Antimicrobial Resistance in E. coli Isolates of Human Urinary Samples and of Weaning and Fattening Pigs from Surveillance and Monitoring Systems in Germany.	Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) data from humans are mostly collected from clinical isolates, whereas from livestock data also exist from colonizing pathogens. In Germany, livestock data are collected from clinical and nonclinical isolates. We compared resistance levels of clinical and nonclinical isolates of Escherichia coli from weaning and fattening pigs with clinical outpatient isolates of humans from urban and rural areas. We also studied the association of AMR with available antimicrobial use (AMU) data from humans and pigs. Differences between rural and urban isolates were minor and did not affect the comparison between human and pig isolates. We found higher resistance levels to most antimicrobials in human isolates compared to nonclinical isolates of fattening pigs. Resistance to ampicillin, however, was significantly more frequent in clinical isolates of fattening pigs and in clinical and nonclinical isolates of weaning pigs compared to isolates from humans. The opposite was observed for ciprofloxacin. Co-trimoxazole resistance proportions were higher in clinical isolates of weaning and fattening pigs as compared to isolates from humans. Resistance proportions were higher in clinical isolates than in nonclinical isolates from pigs of the same age group and were also higher in weaner than in fattening pigs. Significant associations of AMU and AMR were found for gentamicin resistance and aminoglycoside use in humans (borderline) and for ampicillin resistance in clinical isolates and penicillin use in fattening pigs. In summary, we found significant differences between isolates from all populations, requiring more detailed analyses supported by molecular data and better harmonized data on  AMU and AMR.	0
35173214	Changes of operative performance of pulse pressure variation as a predictor of fluid responsiveness in endotoxin shock.	Several limitations regarding pulse pressure variation (PPV) use have been reported. Our aim was to describe changes in the PPV operative performance as a predictor of fluid responsiveness during the development of a swine endotoxin shock model and to assess hemodynamic variables associated with PPV changes. A swine porcine endotoxin shock model was established (Escherichia Coli 055:B5 endotoxin) in 7 pigs, and 3 pigs were included in the control group. The endotoxin was infused until the mean arterial pressure (MAP) dropped below 50 mmHg (TH0); then, the model animal was reanimated with fluids and vasopressors. We performed fluid challenges every hour for 6 h. ROC curve analysis and a linear mixed model were performed. The area under the curve of PPV decreased from 0.95 (0.81-1.00) to 0.60 (0.17-1.00) at TH0. Its cutoff increased  from 10.5 to 22.00% at TH0. PPV showed an inverse relationship with stroke volume, mean systemic filling pressure, MAP, and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (p < 0.001, AIC = 111.85). The PPV operative performance as a predictor of  fluid responsiveness decreased with the progression of shock. This could lead to  an inverse association between PPV and the following variables: MAP and SVR.	0
35163797	The Competitive Endogenous RNA (ceRNA) Regulation in Porcine Alveolar Macrophages (3D4/21) Infected by Swine Influenza Virus (H1N1 and H3N2).	H1N1 and H3N2 are the two most common subtypes of swine influenza virus (SIV). They not only endanger the pig industry, but are also a huge risk of zoonotic diseases. However, the molecular mechanism and regulatory network of pigs (hosts) against influenza virus infection are still unclear. In this study, porcine alveolar macrophage cell (3D4/21) models infected by swine influenza virus (H1N1  and H3N2) were constructed. The expression profiles of miRNAs, mRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNAs after H1N1 and H3N2 infected 3D4/21 cells were revealed in this study. Then, two ceRNAs (TCONS_00166432-miR10391-MAN2A1 and novel_circ_0004733-miR10391-MAN2A1) that regulated H1N1 and H3N2 infection in 3D4/21 cells were verified by the methods of bioinformatics analysis, gene overexpression, gene interference, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), dual luciferase activity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP). In addition, the important candidate molecules (miR-10391, TCONS_00166432, and novel_circ_0004733) were identified by qPCR and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Finally, the regulatory effect and possible molecular mechanism of the target gene MAN2A1  were identified by the methods of gene interference, qPCR, Western blot and ELISA. The results of this study suggested that TCONS_00166432 and novel_circ_0004733 could competitively bind miR-10391 to target the MAN2A1 gene to regulate swine influenza virus infecting 3D4/21 cells. This study reported for the first time the ceRNA networks involved in the regulation of the swine influenza virus infecting 3D4/21 cells, which provided a new insight into the molecular mechanism of 3D4/21 cells against swine influenza virus infection.	0
35327174	Successful Laparoscopic Oviductal Artificial Insemination in the Endangered Tsushima Leopard Cat (Prionailurus bengalensis euptilurus).	The Tsushima leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis euptilurus) is an endangered wild felid that lives solely on Tsushima Island, Nagasaki, Japan. Japan's Ministry of the Environment is working with the Japanese Association of Zoo and Aquariums for ex situ conservation of this species. However, considering genetic  diversity, it is difficult to conduct captive breeding programs by natural breeding alone; hence, assisted reproductive technologies are required. This study aimed to breed Tsushima leopard cats, which otherwise cannot be paired, using laparoscopic oviductal artificial insemination (AI). Female Tsushima leopard cats (female 1, aged 7 years; female 2, aged 6 years) were treated with 200 IU equine chorionic gonadotropin, followed by administration of 1000 IU porcine luteinizing hormone (pLH) after 96 h to induce ovulation. Laparoscopic AI was performed 32 h post-pLH administration. Females 1 and 2 were inseminated in the oviduct with 2.4 × 10⁶ and 3.3 × 10⁶ motile spermatozoa, respectively, collected from two males. Pregnancy was confirmed by radiography 45 and 51 days post-AI in females 1 and 2, respectively; one fetus was found in female 2. Moreover, female 2 had spontaneous delivery of a female kitten 66 days post-AI. This is the first successful case of AI in a Tsushima leopard cat.	0
35433684	A Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism in the Promoter of Porcine ARHGAP24 Gene Regulates Aggressive Behavior of Weaned Pigs After Mixing by Affecting the Binding of Transcription Factor p53.	Pigs are important biomedical model animals for the study of human neurological diseases. Similar to human aggressive behavior in children and adolescents, weaned pigs also show more aggressive behavior after mixing, which has negative effects on animal welfare and growth performance. The identification of functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to the aggressive behavior of pigs would provide valuable molecular markers of the aggressive behavioral trait for genetic improvement program. The Rho GTPase-activating protein 24 (ARHGAP24) gene plays an important role in regulating the process of axon guidance, which may impact the aggressive behavior of pigs. By resequencing  the entire coding region, partially adjacent introns and the 5' and 3' flanking regions, six and four SNPs were identified in the 5' flanking region and 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the porcine ARHGAP24 gene, respectively. Association analyses revealed that nine SNPs were significantly associated with aggressive behavioral traits (p = < 1.00 × 10-4-4.51 × 10-2), and their haplotypes were significantly associated with aggressive behavior (p = < 1.00 × 10-4-2.99 × 10-2). The core promoter region of the ARHGAP24 gene has been identified between  -670 and -1,113 bp. Furthermore, the luciferase activity of allele A of rs335052970 was significantly less than that of allele G, suggesting that the transcriptional activity of the ARHGAP24 gene was inhibited by allele A of rs335052970. It was identified that the transcription factor p53 bound to the transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) containing allele A of rs335052970. In porcine primary neural cells, p53 binds to the target promoter region of the ARHGAP24 gene, reduces its promoter transcriptional activity, and then reduces its messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression. The results demonstrated that the ARHGAP24 gene had significant genetic effects on aggressive behavioral traits of pigs. Therefore, rs335052970 in the ARHGAP24 gene can be used as a molecular marker to select the less aggressive pigs.	0
34851149	Time Series Transcriptomic Analysis of Bronchoalveolar Lavage Cells from Piglets  Infected with Virulent or Low-Virulent Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus 1.	"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has evolved to escape the immune surveillance for a survival advantage leading to a strong modulation of host's immune responses and favoring secondary bacterial infections. However,  limited data are available on how the immunological and transcriptional responses elicited by virulent and low-virulent PRRSV-1 strains are comparable and how they are conserved during the infection. To explore the kinetic transcriptional signature associated with the modulation of host immune response at lung level, a time-series transcriptomic analysis was performed in bronchoalveolar lavage cells upon experimental in vivo infection with two PRRSV-1 strains of different virulence, virulent subtype 3 Lena strain or the low-virulent subtype 1 3249 strain. The time-series analysis revealed overlapping patterns of dysregulated genes enriched in T-cell signaling pathways among both virulent and low-virulent  strains, highlighting an upregulation of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory immune  checkpoints that were disclosed as Hub genes. On the other hand, virulent Lena infection induced an early and more marked ""negative regulation of immune system  process"" with an overexpression of co-inhibitory receptors genes related to T-cell and NK cell functions, in association with more severe lung lesion, lung viral load, and BAL cell kinetics. These results underline a complex network of molecular mechanisms governing PRRSV-1 immunopathogenesis at lung level, revealing a pivotal role of co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory immune checkpoints in the pulmonary disease, which may have an impact on T-cell activation and related pathways. These immune checkpoints, together with the regulation of cytokine-signaling pathways, modulated in a virulence-dependent fashion, orchestrate an interplay among pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. IMPORTANCE Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the major threats to swine health and global production, causing substantial economic losses. We explore the mechanisms involved in the modulation of host immune response at lung level performing a time-series transcriptomic analysis upon experimental infection with two PRRSV-1 strains of different virulence. A complex network of molecular mechanisms was revealed to control the immunopathogenesis of PRRSV-1 infection, highlighting an interplay among pro- and anti-inflammatory responses as a potential mechanism to restrict inflammation-induced lung injury.  Moreover, a pivotal role of co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory immune checkpoints was evidenced, which may lead to progressive dysfunction of T cells, impairing viral clearance and leading to persistent infection, favoring as well secondary bacterial infections or viral rebound. However, further studies should be conducted to evaluate the functional role of immune checkpoints in advanced stages of PRRSV infection and explore a possible T-cell exhaustion state."	0
34909741	A Sensitization-Free Dimethyl Fumarate Prodrug, Isosorbide Di-(Methyl Fumarate),  Provides a Topical Treatment Candidate for Psoriasis.	Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an effective oral treatment for psoriasis administered in Europe for nearly 60 years. However, its potential has been limited by contact dermatitis that prohibits topical application. This paper characterizes a DMF derivative, isosorbide DMF (IDMF), which was designed to have antipsoriatic effects without skin-sensitizing properties. We show that IDMF exhibits neither genotoxicity nor radiation sensitivity in skin fibroblasts and is nonirritating and nonsensitizing in animal models (rat, rabbit, guinea pig). Microarray analysis of cytokine-stimulated keratinocytes showed that IDMF represses the expression of genes specifically upregulated in psoriatic skin lesions but not those of other skin diseases. IDMF also downregulated genes induced by IL-17A and TNF in keratinocytes as well as predicted targets of NF-κB and the antidifferentiation noncoding RNA (i.e., ANCR). IDMF further stimulated the transcription of oxidative stress response genes (NQO1, GPX2, GSR) with stronger  NRF2/ARE activation compared to DMF. Finally, IDMF reduced erythema and scaling while repressing the expression of immune response genes in psoriasiform lesions  elicited by topical application of imiquimod in mice. These data show that IDMF exhibits antipsoriatic activity that is similar or improved compared with that exhibited by DMF, without the harsh skin-sensitizing effects that have prevented  topical delivery of the parent molecule.	0
35350434	Runs of Homozygosity Uncover Potential Functional-Altering Mutation Associated With Body Weight and Length in Two Duroc Pig Lines.	Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are widely used to investigate genetic diversity, demographic history, and positive selection signatures of livestock. Commercial breeds provide excellent materials to reveal the landscape of ROH shaped during the intense selection process. Here, we used the GeneSeek Porcine 50K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) Chip data of 3,770 American Duroc (AD) and 2,096 Canadian Duroc (CD) pigs to analyze the genome-wide ROH. First, we showed that AD had a moderate genetic differentiation with CD pigs, and AD had more abundant genetic diversity and significantly lower level of inbreeding than CD pigs. In addition, sows had larger levels of homozygosity than boars in AD pigs.  These differences may be caused by differences in the selective intensity. Next,  ROH hotspots revealed that many candidate genes are putatively under selection for growth, sperm, and muscle development in two lines. Population-specific ROHs  inferred that AD pigs may have a special selection for female reproduction, while CD pigs may have a special selection for immunity. Moreover, in the overlapping ROH hotspots of two Duroc populations, we observed a missense mutation (rs81216249) located in the growth and fat deposition-related supergene (ARSB-DMGDH-BHMT) region. The derived allele of this variant originated from European pigs and was nearly fixed in Duroc pigs. Further selective sweep and association analyses indicated that this supergene was subjected to strong selection and probably contributed to the improvement of body weight and length in Duroc pigs. These findings will enhance our understanding of ROH patterns in different Duroc lines and provide promising trait-related genes and a functional-altering marker that can be used for genetic improvement of pigs.	0
35122326	Quantifying the probability of detection of wild ungulates with the Judas technique.	The Judas technique is often used in control or eradication of particular vertebrate pests. The technique exploits the tendency of individuals to form social groups. A radio collar is affixed to an individual and its subsequent monitoring facilitates the detection of other conspecifics. Efficacy of this technique would be improved if managers could estimate the probability that a Judas individual would detect conspecifics. To calculate this probability, we estimated association rates of Judas individuals with other Judas individuals, given the length of time the Judas has been deployed. We developed a simple model of space-use for individual Judas animals and constrained detection probabilities to those specific areas. We then combined estimates for individual Judas animals  to infer the probability that a wild individual could be detected in an area of interest via Judas surveillance. We illustrated the method by using data from a feral goat eradication program on Isla Santiago, Galápagos, and a feral pig eradication program on Santa Cruz Island, California. Association probabilities declined as the proximity between individual areas of use of a Judas pair decreased. Unconditional probabilities of detection within individual areas of use averaged 0.09 per month for feral pigs and 0.11 per month for feral goats. Probabilities that eradication had been achieved, given no detections of wild conspecifics, and an uninformative prior probability of eradication were 0.79 (90% CI 0.22-0.99) for feral goats and 0.87 (90% CI 0.44-1.0) for feral pigs. We  envisage several additions to the analyses used that could improve estimates of Judas detection probability. Analyses such as these can help managers increase the efficacy of eradication efforts, leading to more effective effects to restore native biodiversity.	0
35101484	Impact of fertilization with pig or calf slurry on antibiotic residues and resistance genes in the soil.	Antibiotic residues and antibiotic resistance genes can enter the environment via fertilization with calf and pig manure. In a longitudinal study, nine antibiotic  resistance genes (tet(B), tet(L), tet(M), tet(O), tet(Q), tet(W), erm(B), erm(F)  and sul2) and 56 antibiotic residues were investigated in 288 soil samples and 8  corresponding slurry samples from 6 pig farms and 2 veal farms using qPCR and LC-MS/MS, respectively. A significant increase in gene copy number of tet(M), erm(B), erm(F) and sul2 was observed in all the soil layers between sampling times prior to (T1) and 2-3 weeks after fertilization (T3). Tet(B), tet(Q) and tet(L) were least abundant in the soil among the genes tested. From 7 classes of  antibiotics, 20 residues were detected in soil and slurry using an optimized and  validated extraction method. Flumequine was detected in all soil samples in concentrations below 100 μg/kg despite being detected in only half of the corresponding slurry samples. Doxycycline, oxytetracycline, lincomycin and sulfadiazine were also frequently detected in concentrations ranging from 0.1 μg/kg to 500 μg/kg and from 2 μg/kg and 9480 μg/kg in soil and slurry, respectively. Furthermore a positive association between the presence of antibiotic residues (total antibiotic load) and antibiotic resistance genes in soil was found. One possible explanation for this is a simultaneous introduction  of antibiotic residues and resistance genes upon application of animal slurry.	0
34872547	Length of metacarpal and metatarsal bones in five Iranian sheep breeds and their  associations with ungula measurements.	BACKGROUND: This study aimed to measure the length of metacarpal and metatarsal bones in five Iranian sheep breeds and to correlate the length of the bones with  ungula measurements. Thoracic and pelvic limbs of 2-year-old, previously untrimmed, pastured Afshari, Moghani, Kurdi, Makoui, and Lori-Bakhtiari ewes, (n = 20 ewes per breed) were collected after slaughter. The following lengths were recorded in the metacarpal and metatarsal bones: from the margo proximalis lateralis to the lateral (L1) and medial (D1) cartilago physialis; from the margo proximalis lateralis to the margo abaxialis of the lateral (L2) and medial (D2) caput; from the cartilago physialis lateralis to the margo abaxialis of the lateral caput (X1); from the cartilago physialis medialis to the margo distalis of the caput ridge (X2) and from the margo axialis of cartilago physialis to the  margo axialis of the lateral caput (X3). Additionally, measurements of the ungula including pars dorsalis length, pars mobilis lateralis and medialis height, pars  dorsalis height to the ground and to the solea cornea, thickness of the solea in  the pars dorsalis, pars mobilis lateralis and medialis, solea cornea length and angulus dorsalis were recorded in the medial and lateral digits of the thoracic and pelvic limbs. Data on length of the metatarsal and metacarpal bones were analysed using mixed model equations while Pearson correlations were calculated between metacarpal and metatarsal bones and ungula measurements. RESULTS: Lori- Bakhtiari and Moghani ewes had greater L1, L2, and D1 and D2 while X1, X2 and X3 was greater in Kurdi ewes (P < 0.05). Measurements such as L1, L2,  D1 and D2 were greater in the metatarsal than in metacarpal bones (P < 0.05) and  the opposite was observed for X1, X2 and X3 (P < 0.05). No asymmetry was observed between the lateral and medial measurements (P > 0.05). Low to moderate correlations were observed between bone and ungula measurements (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Under the conditions of this study, differences in metacarpal and metatarsal bone measurements were observed between breeds but no asymmetry was observed between lateral and medial bones. Results indicate an association between metacarpal and metatarsal bones ungula measurements. This could provide baseline information for the development and/or improvement of current ungula health protocols in the studied sheep breeds.	0
34902738	The construction and immunogenicity analyses of a recombinant pseudorabies virus  with porcine circovirus type 3 capsid protein co-expression.	Porcine circovirus-associated diseases (PCVADs) and pseudorabies (PR) are highly  contagious and economically significant diseases of swine in China. Porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) is an emerging swine pathogen of PCVAD. Currently, no PCV3 vaccine is commercially available, and the epidemic caused by it is still spreading worldwide. In this study, we used the PRV variant strain HNX as the parental virus to construct recombinant PRV with TK/gE gene deletion and capsid (Cap) protein co-expression, named HNX-ΔTK/ΔgE-ORF2. The results revealed that PCV3 Cap protein can be detected in HNX-ΔTK/ΔgE-ORF2-infected PK-15 cells by both western blotting and immunofluorescence assays. Vaccination with HNX-ΔTK/ΔgE-ORF2 did not cause pruritus, ruffled fur, systemic infection, or inflammation (without high expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in plasma). Furthermore, HNX-ΔTK/ΔgE-ORF2 immunization induced an anti-Cap specific antibody, activated a PRV-specific cellular immune response, and provided 100 % protection to mice against the challenge of the virulent HNX strain. Thus, HNX-ΔTK/ΔgE-ORF2 appears to be a promising vaccine candidate against PRV and PCV3 for the control of the PRV variant and PCV3.	0
34875996	Further host-genomic characterization of total antibody response to PRRSV vaccination and its relationship with reproductive performance in commercial sows: genome-wide haplotype and zygosity analyses.	BACKGROUND: The possibility of using antibody response (S/P ratio) to PRRSV vaccination measured in crossbred commercial gilts as a genetic indicator for reproductive performance in vaccinated crossbred sows has motivated further studies of the genomic basis of this trait. In this study, we investigated the association of haplotypes and runs of homozygosity (ROH) and heterozygosity (ROHet) with S/P ratio and their impact on reproductive performance. RESULTS: There was no association (P-value ≥ 0.18) of S/P ratio with the percentage of ROH or ROHet, or with the percentage of heterozygosity across the whole genome or in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region. However, specific ROH and ROHet regions were significantly associated (P-value ≤ 0.01) with S/P ratio on chromosomes 1, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 13, and 17 but not (P-value ≥ 0.10) with reproductive performance. With the haplotype-based genome-wide association study (GWAS), additional genomic regions associated with  S/P ratio were identified on chromosomes 4, 7, and 9. These regions harbor immune-related genes, such as SLA-DOB, TAP2, TAPBP, TMIGD3, and ADORA. Four haplotypes at the identified region on chromosome 7 were also associated with multiple reproductive traits. A haplotype significantly associated with S/P ratio that is located in the MHC region may be in stronger linkage disequilibrium (LD)  with the quantitative trait loci (QTL) than the previously identified single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (H3GA0020505) given the larger estimate of genetic  variance explained by the haplotype than by the SNP. CONCLUSIONS: Specific ROH and ROHet regions were significantly associated with S/P ratio. The haplotype-based GWAS identified novel QTL for S/P ratio on chromosomes 4, 7, and 9 and confirmed the presence of at least one QTL in the MHC region. The chromosome 7 region was also associated with reproductive performance. These results narrow the search for causal genes in this region and  suggest SLA-DOB and TAP2 as potential candidate genes associated with S/P ratio on chromosome 7. These results provide additional opportunities for marker-assisted selection and genomic selection for S/P ratio as genetic indicator for litter size in commercial pig populations.	0
35155642	The Evidence for a Causal Link Between Disease and Damaging Behavior in Pigs.	Damaging behaviors (DB) such as tail and ear biting are prevalent in pig production and reduce welfare and performance. Anecdotal reports suggest that health challenges increase the risk of tail-biting. The prevalence of tail damage and health problems show high correlations across batches within and between farms. There are many common risk factors for tail-biting and health problems, notably respiratory, enteric and locomotory diseases. These include suboptimal thermal climate, hygiene, stocking density and feed quality. The prevalence of tail damage and health problems also show high correlations across batches within and between farms. However, limited evidence supports two likely causal mechanisms for a direct link between DB and health problems. The first is that generalized poor health (e.g., enzootic pneumonia) on farm poses an increased risk of pigs performing DB. Recent studies indicate a possible causal link between an experimental inflammation and an increase in DB, and suggest a link between cytokines and tail-biting. The negative effects of poor health on the ingestion and processing of nutrients means that immune-stimulated pigs may develop specific nutrient deficiencies, increasing DB. The second causal mechanism involves tail-biting causing poor health. Indirectly, pathogens enter the body via the tail lesion and once infected, systemic spread of infection may  occur. This occurs mainly via the venous route targeting the lungs, and to a lesser extent via cerebrospinal fluid and the lymphatic system. In carcasses with tail lesions, there is an increase in lung lesions, abscessation, arthritis and osteomyelitis. There is also evidence for the direct spread of pathogens between  biters and victims. In summary, the literature supports the association between poor health and DB, particularly tail-biting. However, there is insufficient evidence to confirm causality in either direction. Nevertheless, the limited evidence is compelling enough to suggest that improvements to management and housing to enhance pig health will reduce DB. In the same way, improvements to housing and management designed to address DB, are likely to result in benefits to pig health. While most of the available literature relates to tail-biting, we  suggest that similar mechanisms are responsible for links between health and other DB.	0
35369328	Myocardial Extracellular Volume Fraction Measured by Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging Negatively Correlates With Cardiomyocyte Breadth in a Healthy Porcine Model.	Background: The extracellular volume fraction (ECV) derived from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is extensively used to evaluate myocardial fibrosis. However, due to the limited histological verification in healthy individuals, it  remains unclear whether the size of cardiomyocytes may play a potential role in the physiological changes of ECV. The aim of this study was to examine the association between cardiomyocyte size and myocardial ECV by using a healthy porcine model. Methods: Sixteen domestic healthy pigs were anesthetized and underwent cardiac MRI with mechanical controlled breathing. Intravenous contrast medium was introduced at a dose of 0.2-0.25 mmol/kg. The interventricular septum ECV was calculated using an established MRI procedure, which was based on the pre- and post-contrast T1 values of the heart and individual blood hematocrit. The cardiomyocyte breadth (CmyB) in cross section was measured by hematoxylin and eosin staining to reflect the cardiomyocyte size. Results: Data were successfully acquired from 14 pigs. The CmyB was obtained from the myocardial tissues corresponding to the region of interest on cardiac MRI. The mean ± SD of the ECV was 0.253 ± 0.043, and the mean ± SD of the CmyB was 10.02 ± 0.84 μm. The ECV exhibited a negative correlation with the CmyB (r = -0.729, p = 0.003). Conclusion: The myocardial ECV detected by cardiac MRI is negatively correlated with the CmyB in healthy pigs, demonstrating that the size of cardiomyocytes is potentially associated with the ECV under physiological conditions.	0
35441590	Neocortical pyramidal neurons with axons emerging from dendrites are frequent in  non-primates, but rare in monkey and human.	The canonical view of neuronal function is that inputs are received by dendrites  and somata, become integrated in the somatodendritic compartment and upon reaching a sufficient threshold, generate axonal output with axons emerging from  the cell body. The latter is not necessarily the case. Instead, axons may originate from dendrites. The terms 'axon carrying dendrite' (AcD) and 'AcD neurons' have been coined to describe this feature. In rodent hippocampus, AcD cells are shown to be functionally 'privileged', since inputs here can circumvent somatic integration and lead to immediate action potential initiation in the axon. Here, we report on the diversity of axon origins in neocortical pyramidal cells of rodent, ungulate, carnivore, and primate. Detection methods were Thy-1-EGFP labeling in mouse, retrograde biocytin tracing in rat, cat, ferret, and macaque, SMI-32/βIV-spectrin immunofluorescence in pig, cat, and macaque, and Golgi staining in macaque and human. We found that in non-primate mammals, 10-21% of pyramidal cells of layers II-VI had an AcD. In marked contrast, in macaque and human, this proportion was lower, and was particularly low for supragranular neurons. A comparison of six cortical areas (sensory, association, limbic) in three macaques yielded percentages of AcD cells which varied by a factor of 2 between the areas and between the individuals. Unexpectedly, pyramidal cells in the white matter of postnatal cat and aged human cortex exhibit AcDs to much higher percentages. In addition, interneurons assessed in developing cat and adult human cortex had AcDs at type-specific proportions and for some types at much higher percentages than pyramidal cells. Our findings expand the current knowledge regarding the distribution and proportion of AcD cells in neocortex of  non-primate taxa, which strikingly differ from primates where these cells are mainly found in deeper layers and white matter.	0
34922518	Transcatheter radiofrequency pulmonary artery denervation in swine: the evaluation of lesion degree, hemodynamics and pulmonary hypertension inducibility.	BACKGROUND: Mechanisms of positive effects of pulmonary artery (PA) denervation (PADN) remain poorly understood. The study aimed to evaluate pulmonary hemodynamic changes after PADN and their association with the extent of PA wall damage in an acute thromboxane A2 (TXA2)-induced pulmonary hypertension (PH) model in swine. METHODS: In this experimental sham-controlled study, 17 normotensive male white Landrace pigs (the mean weight 36.2 ± 4.5 kg) were included and randomly assigned to group I (n = 9)-PH modeling before and after PADN, group II (n = 4)-PADN only, or group III (n = 4)-PH modeling before and after a sham procedure. Radiofrequency (RF) PADN was performed in the PA trunk and at the proximal parts  of the right and left PAs. PA wall lesions were characterized at the autopsy study using histological and the immunohistochemical examination. RESULTS: In groups I and II, no statistically significant changes in the mean pulmonary arterial pressure nor systemic blood pressure were found after PADN (-0.8 ± 3.4 vs 4.3 ± 8.6 mmHg, P = 0.47; and 6.0 ± 15.9 vs -8.3 ± 7.5 mmHg, P = 0.1; correspondingly). There was a trend towards a lower diastolic pulmonary  arterial pressure after PADN in group I when compared with group III during repeat PH induction (34.4 ± 2.9 vs 38.0 ± 0.8; P = 0.06). Despite the presence of severe PA wall damage at the RF application sites, S100 expression was preserved  in the majority of PA specimens. The presence of high-grade PA lesions was associated with HR acceleration after PADN (ρ = 0.68, p = 0.03). No significant correlation was found between the grade of PA lesion severity and PA pressure after PADN with or without PH induction. CONCLUSIONS: Extended PADN does not affect PH induction using TXA2. Significant PA adventitia damage is associated with HR acceleration after PADN. Possible delayed effects of PADN on perivascular nerves and pulmonary hemodynamics require further research in chronic experiments.	0
35011225	ACSL4 Directs Intramuscular Adipogenesis and Fatty Acid Composition in Pigs.	The intramuscular fat is a major quality trait of meat, affecting sensory attributes such as flavor and texture. Several previous GWAS studies identified Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) gene as the candidate gene to regulate intramuscular fat content in different pig populations, but the underlying molecular function of ACSL4 in adipogenesis within pig skeletal muscle is not fully investigated. In this study, we isolated porcine endogenous intramuscular adipocyte progenitors and performed ACSL4 loss- and gain-of-function experiments during adipogenic differentiation. Our data showed that ACSL4 is a positive regulator of adipogenesis in intramuscular fat cells isolated from pigs. More interestingly, the enhanced expression of ACSL4 in pig intramuscular adipocytes could increase the cellular content of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as gamma-L eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The above results not only confirmed the function of  ACSL4 in pig intramuscular adipogenesis and meat quality attributes, but also provided new clues for the improvement of the nutritional value of pork for human health.	0
35122624	Mapping and analysis of a spatiotemporal H3K27ac and gene expression spectrum in  pigs.	The limited knowledge of genomic noncoding and regulatory regions has restricted  our ability to decipher the genetic mechanisms underlying complex traits in pigs. In this study, we characterized the spatiotemporal landscape of putative enhancers and promoters and their target genes by combining H3K27ac-targeted ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq in fetal (prenatal days 74-75) and adult (postnatal days 132-150) tissues (brain, liver, heart, muscle and small intestine) sampled from Asian aboriginal Bama Xiang and European highly selected Large White pigs of both sexes. We identified 101,290 H3K27ac peaks, marking 18,521 promoters and 82,769 enhancers, including peaks that were active across all tissues and developmental  stages (which could indicate safe harbor locus for exogenous gene insertion) and  tissue- and developmental stage-specific peaks (which regulate gene pathways matching tissue- and developmental stage-specific physiological functions). We found that H3K27ac and DNA methylation in the promoter region of the XIST gene may be involved in X chromosome inactivation and demonstrated the utility of the  present resource for revealing the regulatory patterns of known causal genes and  prioritizing candidate causal variants for complex traits in pigs. In addition, we identified an average of 1,124 super-enhancers per sample and found that they  were more likely to show tissue-specific activity than ordinary peaks. We have developed a web browser to improve the accessibility of the results ( http://segtp.jxau.edu.cn/pencode/?genome=susScr11 ).	0
34963048	Microfluidic Synthesis of Theranostic Nanoparticles with Near-Infrared Scintillation: Toward Next-Generation Dosimetry in X-ray-Induced Photodynamic Therapy.	We developed a microfluidic synthesis to grow GdF3:Eu theranostic scintillating nanoparticles to simultaneously monitor the X-ray dose delivered to tumors during treatments with X-ray activated photodynamic therapy (X-PDT). The flow reaction was optimized to enhance scintillation emission from the Eu3+ ions. The as-prepared ∼15 nm rhombohedral-shaped nanoparticles self-assembled into ∼100 nm  mesoporous flower-like nanostructures, but the rhombohedral units remained intact and the scintillation spectra unaltered. The conjugation of the ScNPs with multilayers of methylene blue (MB) in a core-shell structure (GdF@MB) resulted in enhanced singlet oxygen (1O2) generation under X-ray irradiation, with maximum 1O2 production for nanoparticles with 4 MB layers (GdF@4MB). High 1O2 yield was further evidenced in cytotoxicity assays, demonstrating complete cell death only  for the association of ScNPs with MB and X-rays. Because the scintillating Eu3+ emission at 694 nm is within the therapeutic window and was only partially absorbed by the MB molecules, it was explored for getting in vivo dosimetric information. Using porcine skin and fat to simulate the optical and radiological  properties of the human tissues, we showed that the scintillation light can be detected for a tissue layer of ∼16 mm, thick enough to be employed in radiotherapy treatments of breast cancers, for instance. Therefore, the GdF3:Eu ScNPs and the GdF@4MB nanoconjugates are strong candidates for treating cancer with X-PDT while monitoring the treatment and the radiation dose delivered, opening new avenues to develop a next-generation modality of real-time in vivo dosimetry.	0
35024554	Phenotypic detection, antimicrobial susceptibility and virulence profile of staphylococci in the pig production setting, Makurdi, Nigeria.	Livestock, particularly pigs, have increasingly been recognized as important reservoirs for zoonotic transmission of pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococci. Livestock production systems in developing countries of sub-Saharan Africa, including Nigeria, are characterized by high misuse/abuse of  antimicrobials and a close association between humans and these animals, which promotes the emergence and transmission of resistant and potentially virulent bacteria. In the present study, we investigated the occurrence and characteristics (species distribution, virulence and resistance profile) of staphylococci from smallholder backyard pig farms, slaughter slabs and pig handlers in Makurdi, Nigeria. A total of 330 nasal swabs originating from 300 pigs and 30 in-contact humans were collected and processed. One hundred and thirteen samples [34.2 %; 95 % confidence interval (CI): 29.1-39.6] comprising 103 (34.3 %; 95 % CI: 29.0-40.0) and 10 (33.3 %; 95 % CI: 17.3-52.8 %) samples from pigs and humans, respectively, were positive for staphylococci, yielding 120 isolates (pigs n=110, humans n=10). The 120 isolates were distributed into 15 species with Staphylococcus aureus (n=25) followed by Staphylococcus cohnii (n=19) and Staphylococcus sciuri (n=14) occurring more frequently. All isolates were resistant to β-lactam (100 %) antibiotics. Resistance to some critical antimicrobials, including linezolid (22 %), vancomycin (19.2 %), gentamicin (7.5%) and the fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin (75.8 %) and enrofloxacin (66.7 %), was also observed. Majority (99.2 %) of the isolates displayed a multidrug resistance phenotype with the AMP-C-CIP-E-ENR-FOX-OX-P-S-SXT-TE phenotype being predominant. Overall, 70 % of the isolates expressed the methicillin resistance phenotype, out of which 20 % (n=17) were MRSA. Resistance to serum bactericidal activity and biofilm production were respectively observed in 45 (100 %) and 5 (11.3 %) of the coagulase-positive staphylococci. Our findings demonstrated the occurrence of a high diversity of staphylococci expressing multidrug resistance and potentially virulent phenotypes among healthy swine and pig handlers in small-scale backyard farms in North-Central Nigeria. These findings underscore the potential role of pig production settings in the emergence and dissemination  of potentially virulent staphylococci and the importance of the development of antimicrobial resistance monitoring systems/implementation of control measures in developing countries. Proper hygienic practices and control of indiscriminate use and misuse of antibiotics are recommended.	0
35296347	Investigating the effects of peptide-based, MOS and protease feed additives on the growth performance and fecal microbial composition of weaned pigs.	BACKGROUND: Digestive disorders in weaning pigs remain a major challenge for swine producers. Different types of commercial feed additives have been developed to promote gut health and development in young pigs, but their effects on resident gut microbial communities remain largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of a peptide-based product (Peptiva) in combination with mannose oligosaccharides (MOS) and an exogenous protease on the  performance and fecal microbiome of nursery pigs. METHODS: A total of 1097 weaned pigs were divided into 44 pens (24-26 pigs/pen) with each pen randomly assigned to one of four experimental diets as part of Phase II and Phase III of a standard nursery phase feeding program. Fecal samples collected from representative control and treatment pigs were used to investigate bacterial composition profiles by high throughput sequencing of PCR-generated amplicons targeting the V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene. RESULTS: Higher gain:feed was observed for pigs fed Peptiva and MOS compared to Controls during the period when experimental diets were fed, but the benefits of  supplementation were not maintained after pigs were transitioned to a non-supplemented diet. Three candidate bacterial species, identified as Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), were found to have significantly different abundances between control samples and treatment samples during the same phase. In Phase III samples, SD_Ssd-00039, predicted to be a strain of Streptococcus alactolyticus based on nucleotide sequence identity, was the most highly represented of these OTUs with an average abundance in pigs fed Peptiva, MOS and  protease that was 3.9 times higher than in Controls. The report also presents evidence of microbial succession that occurred during the trial, with 16 of the 32 most abundant OTUs found to vary between Phase II and Phase III samples for the same dietary treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary supplementation with a combination of a peptide-based product, MOS, and protease increased the growth performance of weaned pigs compared to control animals during the nursery phase, but these benefits were no  longer observed within 2 weeks after all animals were transitioned to a non-supplemented diet. Supplementation with these feed additives was found to modulate the composition of the swine gut microbiome during this period.	0
35146013	Construction and Immunogenicity of a Recombinant Pseudorabies Virus Variant With  TK/gI/gE/11k/28k Deletion.	In China, the re-emerging pseudorabies virus (PRV) variant has caused large-scale outbreaks of pseudorabies in swine herds with classical PRV vaccine immunization  since late 2011. Here, a recombinant PRV with TK/gI/gE/11k/28k deletion was constructed based on variant HN1201 strain isolated in 2012, by the bacterial artificial chromosome infectious clones. Compared with the parental virus, the recombinant PRV rHN1201TK-/gE-/gI-/11k-/28k- showed a similar virus grown curve and exhibited smaller plaques. The vaccination of rHN1201TK-/gE-/gI-/11k-/28k- could elicit an earlier and higher level of gB antibody, and the neutralizing antibodies elicited by rHN1201TK-/gE-/gI-/11k-/28k- were effective against both PRV classical and variant strains. Clinically, the body temperature of the pigs immunized with rHN1201TK-/gE-/gI-/11k-/28k- was significantly lower than that of  the classical PRV vaccine immunized pigs, and the recombinant PRV could provide effective protection against the challenge with the PRV variant. These results imply that the rHN1201TK-/gE-/gI-/11k-/28k- could be a promising vaccine candidate for the prevention of the current epidemic of pseudorabies in China.	0
34878947	Quantitative susceptibility mapping as a measure of cerebral oxygenation in neonatal piglets.	Prominence of cerebral veins using susceptibility weighted magnetic resonance imaging (SWI) has been used as a qualitative indicator of cerebral venous oxygenation (CvO2). Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) adds more precision to the assessment of CvO2, but has not been applied to neonatal hypoxic ischemic  injury (HII). We proposed to study QSM measures of venous susceptibility and their correlation with direct measures of brain oxygenation and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the neonatal piglet. The association of QSM intravascular cerebral  venous susceptibility, with brain tissue O2 tension, CBF, cortical tissue oxyhemoglobin saturation, and the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood measurement during various oxygenation states was determined by linear regression. Compared to normoxia, venous susceptibility in the straight sinus increased 56.8 ± 25.4% during hypoxia, while decreasing during hyperoxia (23.5 ± 32.9%) and hypercapnia (23.3 ± 73.1%), which was highly correlated to all other measures of oxygenation (p < 0.0001) but did not correlate to CBF (p = 0.82). These findings demonstrate a strong relationship between venous susceptibility and brain tissue O2 tension. Our results suggest that QSM-derived  venous susceptibility is sensitive to cerebral oxygenation status across various  oxygenation states.	0
35090573	Serotonin receptors and their association with the immune system in the gastrointestinal tract of weaning piglets.	BACKGROUND: Immune cell activation and perpetuation of inflammation have been attributed to the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT). Our hypothesis was that the 5-HT system plays a role in GI health and immunity in post-weaning piglets. A disruption of the 5-HT system post-weaning with transcriptional upregulation of 5-HT receptors may be linked to increased cytokine mRNA abundance and immune system activation. METHODS: The objective of this exploratory study was to assess the relationship between 5-HT receptor expression and immune system biomarkers in piglets at 1 (n = 9) and 15 (n = 10) days post-weaning. The mRNA transcript abundance of three 5-HT receptors (5-HTR3, 5-HTR4, and 5-HTR7) measured in jejunum and colon tissues were used to determine the relationship with the immune system and jejunal morphometry at 2 timepoints post-weaning using correlations, mixed models, and multivariate analysis techniques. RESULTS: Overall, 5-HT receptor mRNA expression decreased from day 1 to day 15 post-weaning. Time × tissue interactions showed the lowest 5-HTR3 expression in the colon and lower 5-HTR7 expression in the jejunum at 15 days post-weaning. 5-HTR3 and 5-HTR4 expression were negatively associated with pro-inflammatory (IFN-ɣ) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10 and IL-12β) cytokines in jejunum, and with TNF-α in the colon at 1-day post-weaning. At 15 days post-weaning, 5-HTR3 in the  colon was negatively associated with pro-inflammatory (IL-1α, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-8, and IFN-ɣ) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10 and IL-12β) cytokines. Furthermore, 5-HTR7 expressed a predominantly pro-inflammatory profile (IFN-α, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-8, TNF-α and IL-12α) in the jejunum at the same timepoint, whereas colonic 5-HTR7 expression was negatively correlated with IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-10 and TGF-β. Lastly, positive correlations were found for increased expression of 5-HTR4 receptor with villus height, 5-HTR7 receptor expression and crypt depth, and increased expression of 5-HTR3 and 5-HTR4 receptor with villus height to crypt depth ratio at 1-day post-weaning. CONCLUSIONS: The 5-HT receptor mRNA abundance was associated with the immune system and intestinal morphometry in piglets. The 5-HT receptors were highly expressed at weaning in both jejunum and colon tissues relative to 15 days post-weaning. Although a clear relationship between immune system and 5-HTR expression is observed, particularly at day 15, a cause-consequence cannot be proven with current data. Further research is warranted to elucidate the effects  of 5-HT on gastrointestinal inflammation during the weaning process in piglets, which could be the basis for new interventions to ease weaning stress.	0
35449721	Prevalence of carbapenem resistance and its potential association with antimicrobial use in humans and animals in rural communities in Vietnam.	Background: Vietnam and Southeast Asia are hotspots for antimicrobial resistance; however, little is known on the prevalence of carriage of carbapenem resistance in non-hospitalized humans and in animals. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), particularly Escherichia coli (CREC) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) and also Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) are emerging threats worldwide. Methods: We investigated healthy humans (n = 652), chickens (n = 237), ducks (n = 150) and pigs (n = 143) in 400 small-scale farms in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. Samples (rectal swabs, faecal swabs) were investigated for carriage of CRE/CRAB and were further characterized phenotypically and genotypically. Results: In the Mekong Delta of Vietnam, the prevalence of CRE isolates in human  rectal swabs was 0.6%, including 4 CREC and 1 CRKP. One pig was infected with CREC (prevalence 0.7%). CRAB was isolated from chickens (n = 4) (prevalence 2.1%) and one duck (prevalence 0.7%). CRKP was isolated from a human who was also colonized with CREC. The CRKP strain (ST16), from an 80 year-old person with pneumonia under antimicrobial treatment, genetically clustered with clinical strains isolated in a hospital outbreak in southern Vietnam. The prevalence of CRE was higher among humans that had used antimicrobials within 90 days of the sampling date than those had not (4.2% versus 0.2%) (P = 0.005). All CRE/CRAB strains were MDR, although they were susceptible to colistin and neomycin. The carbapenemase genes identified in study strains were bla NDM and bla OXA. Conclusions: The finding of a CRKP strain clustering with previous hospital outbreak raises concerns about potential transmission of carbapenem-resistant organisms from hospital to community settings or vice-versa.	0
35111328	Survey of Salmonellae occurrence in meat-producing rabbitries in Switzerland.	BACKGROUND: An outbreak of salmonellosis due to Salmonella Typhimurium was detected coincidentally in a Swiss meat rabbitry, given that surveillance of Salmonella in rabbits is not mandatory in Switzerland. METHODS: To assess the extent of potentially subclinical Salmonella carriage in meat rabbits, faecal pool samples of 50 farms (90% of Swiss commercial rabbitries) with ground covering litter and group housing were bacteriologically  tested. Additionally, 236 rabbits showing clinical signs compatible with intestinal diseases, such as salmonellosis, were examined postmortem and analysed bacteriologically. Salmonella isolates were serotyped and analysed by whole genome sequencing (WGS). RESULTS: Salmonella Typhimurium was detected in three commercial farms (6.0% of all tested farms). The affected farms were directly linked to the animal trade and Salmonella isolates were shown to be identical by WGS. CONCLUSION: There is no increased hazard for Salmonella carriage in the animal welfare-friendly Swiss husbandry systems in general, despite risk factors such as ground covering litter.	0
35273382	Introgressive hybridisation between domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) and endemic Corsican wild boars (S. s. meridionalis): effects of human-mediated interventions.	Owing to the intensified domestication process with artificial trait selection, introgressive hybridisation between domestic and wild species poses a management  problem. Traditional free-range livestock husbandry, as practiced in Corsica and  Sardinia, is known to facilitate hybridisation between wild boars and domestic pigs (Sus scrofa). Here, we assessed the genetic distinctness and genome-wide domestic pig ancestry levels of the Corsican wild boar subspecies S. s. meridionalis, with reference to its Sardinian conspecifics, employing a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay and mitochondrial control  region (mtCR) haplotypes. We also assessed the reliance of morphological criteria and the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) coat colour gene to identify individuals with domestic introgression. While Corsican wild boars showed closest affinity to Sardinian and Italian wild boars compared to other European populations based on  principal component analysis, the observation of previously undescribed mtCR haplotypes and high levels of nuclear divergence (Weir's θ > 0.14) highlighted the genetic distinctness of Corsican S. s. meridionalis. Across three complementary analyses of mixed ancestry (i.e., STRUCTURE, PCADMIX, and ELAI), proportions of domestic pig ancestry were estimated at 9.5% in Corsican wild boars, which was significantly higher than in wild boars in Sardinia, where free-range pig keeping was banned in 2012. Comparison of morphologically pure- and hybrid-looking Corsican wild boars suggested a weak correlation between morphological criteria and genome-wide domestic pig ancestry. The study highlights the usefulness of molecular markers to assess the direct impacts of management practices on gene flow between domestic and wild species.	0
35019865	Patella cryo-free technique with recycled frozen autograft reconstruction preserves extensor mechanism for proximal tibial malignancy.	BACKGROUNDS: We designed a patella cryo-free method to protect patella from cryoinjury during recycled frozen bone-prosthesis-composite reconstruction for proximal tibial malignancy. This study aimed to use animal model to ensure safety and efficacy of this method and reported our clinical outcomes. METHODS: Six swine proximal tibias along with patella and patellar tendon were harvested and dived into group A (n = 3, traditional patella freezing) and group  B (n = 3, patella cryo-free). Temperature curve measurement, histological analysis, and TUNEL assay were performed in both groups. Clinically, we retrospectively reviewed 23 patients with proximal tibia malignant bone tumor (13: traditional patella freezing method; 10: patella cryo-free method). The clinical and functional outcomes were reported and compared in both groups. RESULTS: Temperature curve of the group B showed that ideal therapeutic temperature (<-60°C) required to kill tumor cells can be achieved in the proximal tibia while the innocent patella can be kept in room temperature at all time. Histological analysis showed better preservation of the cartilage tissue in patella of group B. TUNEL assay showed significantly more apoptotic cells in the  frozen tibia of both groups and frozen patella of group A. When reviewing our clinical results, less complication of the patella as well as better functional preservation were found in patients subjecting to patella cryo-free method. No local recurrence was observed in either group. CONCLUSION: Patellar cryo-free technique could protect patella from cryoinjury during freezing and therefore preserve more extensor functions for patients with  proximal tibial malignant bone tumors.	0
34951645	Phylogeography Reveals Association between Swine Trade and the Spread of Porcine  Epidemic Diarrhea Virus in China and across the World.	The ongoing SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-CoV (coronavirus)-2 pandemic has exposed major gaps in our knowledge on the origin, ecology, evolution, and spread of animal coronaviruses. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae that may have originated from bats and leads to significant hazards and widespread epidemics in the swine population. The role of local and global trade of live swine and swine-related products in disseminating PEDV remains unclear, especially in developing countries with complex swine production systems. Here, we undertake an in-depth phylogeographic analysis of PEDV sequence data (including 247 newly sequenced samples) and employ an extension of this inference framework that enables formally testing the contribution of a range of predictor variables to the geographic spread of PEDV. Within China, the provinces of Guangdong and Henan were identified as primary hubs for the spread of PEDV, for which we estimate live swine trade to play a very important role. On a global scale, the United States and China maintain the highest number of PEDV lineages. We estimate that,  after an initial introduction out of China, the United States acted as an important source of PEDV introductions into Japan, Korea, China, and Mexico. Live swine trade also explains the dispersal of PEDV on a global scale. Given the increasingly global trade of live swine, our findings have important implications for designing prevention and containment measures to combat a wide range of livestock coronaviruses.	0
35186025	Genome-Wide Assessment of a Korean Composite Pig Breed, Woori-Heukdon.	A Korean synthetic pig breed, Woori-Heukdon (WRH; F3), was developed by crossing  parental breeds (Korean native pig [KNP] and Korean Duroc [DUC]) with their crossbred populations (F1 and F2). This study in genome-wide assessed a total of  2,074 pigs which include the crossbred and the parental populations using the Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip. After quality control of the initial datasets, we performed population structure, genetic diversity, and runs of homozygosity (ROH) analyses. Population structure analyses showed that crossbred populations were genetically influenced by the parental breeds according to their generation stage in the crossbreeding scheme. Moreover, principal component analysis showed the dispersed cluster of WRH, which might reflect introducing a new breeding group into the previous one. Expected heterozygosity values, which were used to assess  genetic diversity, were .365, .349, .336, .330, and .211 for WRH, F2, F1, DUC, and KNP, respectively. The inbreeding coefficient based on ROH was the highest in KNP (.409), followed by WRH (.186), DUC (.178), F2 (.107), and F1 (.035). Moreover, the frequency of short ROH decreased according to the crossing stage (from F1 to WRH). Alternatively, the frequency of medium and long ROH increased,  which indicated recent inbreeding in F2 and WRH. Furthermore, gene annotation of  the ROH islands in WRH that might be inherited from their parental breeds revealed several interesting candidate genes that may be associated with adaptation, meat quality, production, and reproduction traits in pigs.	0
35369845	Genome wide copy number variations using Porcine 60K SNP Beadchip in Landlly pigs.	In the present study, Porcine 60K SNP genotype data from 69 Landlly pigs were used to explore Copy Number Variations (CNVs) across the autosomes. A total of 386 CNVs were identified using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in PennCNV software, which were subsequently aggregated to 115 CNV regions (CNVRs). Among the total detected CNVRs, 58 gain, 49 were loss type while remaining 8 events were both gain and loss types. Identified CNVRs covered 12.5 Mb (0.55%) of Sus scrofa reference 11.1 genome. Comparison of our results with previous investigations on  pigs revealed that approximately 75% CNVRs were novel, which may be due to differences in genetic background, environment and implementation of artificial selection in Landlly pigs. Functional annotation and pathway analysis showed the  significant enrichment of 267 well-annotated Sus scrofa genes in CNVRs. These genes were involved in different biological functions like sensory perception, meat quality traits, back fat thickness and immunity. Additionally, KIT and FUT1  were two major genes detected on CNVR in our population. This investigation provided a comprehensive overview of CNV distribution in the Indian porcine genome for the first time, which may be useful for further investigating the association of important quantitative traits in Landlly pigs.Highlights115 CNVRs  were identified in 69 Landlly pig population.Approximately 75% detected CNVRs were novel for Landlly population.Significant enrichment of 267 well-annotated Sus scrofa genes observed in these CNVRs.These genes were involved in different biological functions like sensory perception, meat quality traits, back fat thickness and immunity.Comprehensive CNV map in the Indian porcine genome developed for the first time.	0
35022274	Diagnostic Value of Circulating Antigens in the Serum of Piglets with Experimental Acute Toxoplasmosis.	Toxoplasmosis, caused by Toxoplasma gondii, an apicomplexan parasite, infects all warm-blooded animals, including a third of the human population. Laboratory diagnosis of acute toxoplasmosis is based on the detection of anti-T. gondii IgM  and IgG and T. gondii nucleic acid; however, these assays have certain limitations. Circulating Ags (CAgs) are reliable diagnostic indicators of acute infection. In this study, we established a model of acute T. gondii infection in  Large White pigs. CAg levels peaked between 3 and 5 d after inoculation, and 28 CAgs were identified using an immunoprecipitation-shotgun approach, among which dolichol-phosphate-mannose synthase family protein (TgDPM), C3HC zinc finger-like protein (TgZFLP3), and ribosomal protein RPL7 (TgRPL7) were selected to further investigate their value in the diagnosis of acute toxoplasmosis. Immunofluorescence assays revealed that TgDPM and TgRPL7 were localized in the membrane surface, while TgZFLP3 was localized in the apical end. Western blotting revealed the presence of the three proteins in the serum during acute infection.  Indirect ELISA results indicate that TgZFLP3 is likely to be a novel candidate for the diagnosis of acute toxoplasmosis. However, these three proteins may not be useful as candidate vaccines against toxoplasmosis owing to their low protective ability. In addition, deletion of the zflp3 gene partially attenuated  virulence in Kunming mice. Collectively, we identified 28 CAgs in the serum of piglets with experimental acute toxoplasmosis and confirmed that TgZFLP3 is a potential biomarker for acute T. gondii infection. The results of this study provide data to improve the detection efficiency of acute toxoplasmosis.	0
35061866	Risk factors for the abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes aph(3')-III, erm(B), sul2 and tet(W) in pig and broiler faeces in nine European countries.	OBJECTIVES: The occurrence and zoonotic potential of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in pigs and broilers has been studied intensively in past decades. Here, we describe AMR levels of European pig and broiler farms and determine the potential risk factors. METHODS: We collected faeces from 181 pig farms and 181 broiler farms in nine European countries. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to quantify the relative abundance of four antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) [aph(3')-III, erm(B), sul2 and tet(W)] in these faeces samples. Information on antimicrobial use (AMU) and other farm characteristics was collected through a questionnaire. A mixed model using country and farm as random effects was performed to evaluate the relationship of AMR with AMU and other farm characteristics. The correlation  between individual qPCR data and previously published pooled metagenomic data was evaluated. Variance component analysis was conducted to assess the variance contribution of all factors. RESULTS: The highest abundance of ARG was for tet(W) in pig faeces and erm(B) in  broiler faeces. In addition to the significant positive association between corresponding ARG and AMU levels, we also found on-farm biosecurity measures were associated with relative ARG abundance in both pigs and broilers. Between-country and between-farm variation can partially be explained by AMU. Different ARG targets may have different sample size requirements to represent the overall farm level precisely. CONCLUSIONS: qPCR is an efficient tool for targeted assessment of AMR in livestock-related samples. The AMR variation between samples was mainly contributed to by between-country, between-farm and within-farm differences, and  then by on-farm AMU.	0
35079818	Weighted single-step GWAS for body mass index and scans for recent signatures of  selection in Yorkshire pigs.	Controlling extra fat deposition is economically favorable in modern swine industry. Understanding the genetic architecture of fat deposition traits such as body mass index (BMI) can help in improving genomic selection for such traits. We utilized a weighted single-step genome-wide association study (WssGWAS) to detect genetic regions and candidate genes associated with BMI in a Yorkshire pig population. Three extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH)-related statistics were also incorporated within a de-correlated composite of multiple signals (DCMS) framework to detect recent selection signatures signals. Overall, the full pedigree consisted of 7,016 pigs, of which 5,561 had BMI records and 598 pigs were genotyped with an 80 K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. Results showed that the most significant windows (top 15) explained 9.35% of BMI genetic  variance. Several genes were detected in regions previously associated with pig fat deposition traits and treated as potential candidate genes for BMI in Yorkshire pigs: FTMT, SRFBP1, KHDRBS3, FOXG1, SOD3, LRRC32, TSKU, ACER3, B3GNT6,  CCDC201, ADCY1, RAMP3, TBRG4, CCM2. Signature of selection analysis revealed multiple candidate genes previously associated with various economic traits. However, BMI genetic variance explained by regions under selection pressure was minimal (1.31%). In conclusion, candidate genes associated with Yorkshire pigs' BMI trait were identified using WssGWAS. Gene enrichment analysis indicated that  the identified candidate genes were enriched in the insulin secretion pathway. We anticipate that these results further advance our understanding of the genetic architecture of BMI in Yorkshire pigs and provide information for genomic selection for fat deposition in this breed.	0
35396557	The transcriptome from asexual to sexual in vitro development of Cystoisospora suis (Apicomplexa: Coccidia).	The apicomplexan parasite Cystoisospora suis is an enteropathogen of suckling piglets with woldwide distribution. As with all coccidian parasites, its lifecycle is characterized by asexual multiplication followed by sexual development with two morphologically distinct cell types that presumably fuse to  form a zygote from which the oocyst arises. However, knowledge of the sexual development of C. suis is still limited. To complement previous in vitro studies, we analysed transcriptional profiles at three different time points of development (corresponding to asexual, immature and mature sexual stages) in vitro via RNASeq. Overall, transcription of genes encoding proteins with important roles in gametes biology, oocyst wall biosynthesis, DNA replication and axonema formation as well as proteins with important roles in merozoite biology was identified. A homologue of an oocyst wall tyrosine rich protein of Toxoplasma gondii was expressed in macrogametes and oocysts of C. suis. We evaluated inhibition of sexual development in a host-free culture for C. suis by antiserum  specific to this protein to evaluate whether it could be exploited as a candidate for control strategies against C. suis. Based on these data, targets can be defined for future strategies to interrupt parasite transmission during sexual development.	0
35020825	Boar spermadhesin AWN: novel insights in its binding behavior and localization on sperm.	As a major spermadhesin first found in the seminal plasma (SP) of boars, AWN is described to fulfil a variety of reproduction related tasks. Although being the best investigated boar spermadhesin, information about its interaction with membranes is inconsistent. In this regard, previous reports locate AWN either inside or on the surface of sperm cells and at different regions, depending on the method and antibody used. Here, we localize native AWN (natAWN) in/on epididymal, ejaculated, capacitated, and acrosome-reacted boar sperm using epifluorescence and electron microscopy as well as an analysis of potential lipid-binding partners of natAWN and recombinant AWN (recAWN). By applying a custom-made anti-AWN antibody, localization of AWN in the equatorial segment (EQS) of ejaculated, capacitated, and acrosome-reacted boar sperm was discovered. Electron microscopy showed that AWN is localized both on the sperm surface and on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane and in close vicinity to the nuclear  and both acrosomal membranes of sperm. Analysis of epididymal sperm indicated migration of AWN from the retral postacrosomal part to the EQS during the epididymal passage. In contrast to hypotheses claiming a specific association of  AWN to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and in line with our previous study describing an interaction with phosphatidic acid (PA), the current results show a rather electrostatically driven binding mechanism of AWN to negative lipids. In conclusion, this work provides new insights into the arrangement of AWN in the EQS, which suggest a possible role in sperm-oocyte fusion.	0
35401691	Combined Analysis of RRBS DNA Methylome and Transcriptome Reveal Novel Candidate  Genes Related to Porcine Clostridium perfringens Type C-Induced Diarrhea.	Clostridium perfringens type C (Cp) is one of the principal microorganisms responsible for bacterial diarrhea in neonatal and pre-weaning piglets. To better understand the molecular effects of Cp infection, we performed a genome-wide comparison of the changes in DNA methylation and gene expression in Cp infected resistant and susceptible piglets. We characterized the pattern of changes in methylation and found 6485, 5968, and 6472 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of piglets infected with Cp in IR vs. IC, IS vs. IC, and IS vs. IR groups, respectively. These methylation changes for genes mainly involved in immune and inflammatory responses, cell adhesion, and activation of transcription factors. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analyses showed that the differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were associated with negative regulation of transcription, apoptotic processes, protein binding, and kinase activity. In addition, they were enriched  in immunity-related pathways, such as MAPK signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor  signaling pathway, and NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Integrative analysis identified 168, 198, and 7 mRNAs showing inverse correlations between methylation and expression with Cp infection. Altered DNA methylation and expression of various genes suggested their roles and potential functional interactions upon Cp infection, 14 immune-associated mRNAs with differential methylation and transcriptional repression were identified in IS vs. IR, commonly revealing that  the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) LBP, TBX21, and LCN2 were likely involved in the piglets against Cp infection. The present results provide further insight into the DNA methylation epigenetic alterations of C. perfringens type C  infected piglet ileum tissues, and may advance the identification of biomarkers and drug targets for predicting susceptibility to and controlling C. perfringens  type C-induced piglet diarrhea.	0
35378984	The RAISE Trial: A Novel Device and First-in-Man Trial.	BACKGROUND: Currently, standard medical therapies have limited effects on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which impacts on the life quality and survival of patients. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the percutaneous radiofrequency ablation-based interatrial shunting for HFpEF with a novel atrial septostomy device. METHODS: A preclinical study in 11 normal domestic pigs and the first-in-man study in 10 patients with HFpEF were performed. The major safety events and interatrial shunt performance were evaluated at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and  6 months post-procedure in both animals and human patients. The clinical functional status was also assessed in the first-in-man study. RESULTS: Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation-based interatrial shunting therapy  was performed successfully both in animals and patients. In the animal study, a left-to-right interatrial shunt was created with a mean defect size of 5.5±2.2 mm without procedure-related safety events. Seven pigs showed the continuous shunting with a mean defect size of 4.1±1.5 mm at 6 months. In the first-in-man study, a median interatrial defect diameter of 5.0 (4.0-6.0) mm was measured immediately. No major safety events including death and thromboembolism were observed. The continuous shunting with the defect size of 4.0 (3.0-4.0) mm could  still be observed in 7 patients at 6 months. The clinical status was significantly improved with NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) reduced by 2149 pg/mL ([95% CI, 204-3301] P=0.028), with 6-minute walk distance increased by 88 m ([95% CI, 50-249] P=0.008) and with New York Heart Association  class improved in 8 patients at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: The present results showed that percutaneous radiofrequency ablation-based interatrial shunting was a safe and potentially effective therapy  for HFpEF, providing a nonpharmacological and nonimplanted option for HFpEF management.

35322371	Effect of Carbonyl Cyanide Chlorophenylhydrazone on Intrabacterial Concentration  and Antimicrobial Activity of Amphenicols against Swine Resistant Actinobacillus  pleuropneumoniae and Pasteurella multocida.	Effects and mechanism of carbonyl cyanide chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) on antimicrobial activity of florfenicol (FF) and thiamphenicol (TAP) were investigated against amphenicol-resistant Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Pasteurella multocida isolated from diseased swine. Broth microdilution and time-kill assays indicated that CCCP dose-dependently and substantially (4-32 fold MIC reduction) improved amphenicol antimicrobial activity. When combined with CCCP at the lowest literature reported dose (2-5 μg/mL), 85% FF resistant A. pleuropneumoniae and 92% resistant P. multocida showed significantly reduced FF MICs (≥ 4-fold). In contrast, none or few of the susceptible A. pleuropneumoniae  and P. multocida had FF MICs reduction ≥ 4-fold. 90% FF resistant A. pleuropneumoniae and 96% resistant P. multocida carried the floR gene, indicating strong association with the FloR efflux pump. With CCCP, the intracellular FF concentration increased by 71% in floR+ resistant A. pleuropneumoniae and 156% in floR+ resistant P. multocida strains but not the susceptible strains. The degree  of reduction in TAP MICs was found consistently in parallel to FF for both bacteria. Taken together, partially attributed to blockage of drug-efflux, the combination of FF or TAP with CCCP at sub-cytotoxic concentrations was demonstrated and showed feasibility to combat amphenicol-resistant A. pleuropneumoniae and P. multocida isolated from diseased swine.	0
35216013	A Conserved Receptor-Binding Domain in the VP1u of Primate Erythroparvoviruses Determines the Marked Tropism for Erythroid Cells.	Parvovirus B19 (B19V) is a human pathogen with a marked tropism for erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs). The N-terminal of the VP1 unique region (VP1u) contains  a receptor-binding domain (RBD), which mediates virus uptake through interaction  with an as-yet-unknown receptor (VP1uR). Considering the central role of VP1uR in the virus tropism, we sought to investigate its expression profile in multiple cell types. To this end, we established a PP7 bacteriophage-VP1u bioconjugate, sharing the size and VP1u composition of native B19V capsids. The suitability of  the PP7-VP1u construct as a specific and sensitive VP1uR expression marker was validated in competition assays with B19V and recombinant VP1u. VP1uR expression  was exclusively detected in erythroid cells and cells reprogrammed towards the erythroid lineage. Sequence alignment and in silico protein structure prediction  of the N-terminal of VP1u (N-VP1u) from B19V and other primate erythroparvoviruses (simian, rhesus, and pig-tailed) revealed a similar structure characterized by a fold of three or four α-helices. Functional studies with simian parvovirus confirmed the presence of a conserved RBD in the N-VP1u, mediating virus internalization into human erythroid cells. In summary, this study confirms the exclusive association of VP1uR expression with cells of the erythroid lineage. The presence of an analogous RBD in the VP1u from non-human primate erythroparvoviruses emphasizes their parallel evolutionary trait and zoonotic potential.	0
35154256	Assessment of Heterozygosity and Genome-Wide Analysis of Heterozygosity Regions in Two Duroc Pig Populations.	Heterozygosity can effectively reflect the diverse models of population structure and demographic history. However, the genomic distribution of heterozygotes and the correlation between regions of heterozygosity (runs of heterozygosity, ROHet) and phenotypes are largely understudied in livestock. The objective of this study was to identify ROHet in the Duroc pig genome, and investigate the relationships  between ROHet and eight important economic traits. Here, we genotyped 3,770 American Duroc (S21) and 2,096 Canadian Duroc (S22) pigs using 50 K single nucleotide polymorphism array to analyze heterozygosity. A total of 145,010 and 84,396 ROHets were characterized for S21 and S22 populations, respectively. ROHet segments were mostly enriched in 1-2 Mb length classification (75.48% in S21 and  72.25% in S22). The average genome length covered by ROHet was 66.53 ± 12.20 Mb in S21 and 73.32 ± 13.77 Mb in S22 pigs. Additionally, we detected 20 and 13 ROHet islands in S21 and S22 pigs. Genes in these genomic regions were mainly involved in the biological processes of immunity and reproduction. Finally, the genome-wide ROHet-phenotypes association analysis revealed that 130 ROHets of S21 and 84 ROHets of S22 were significantly associated with eight economic traits. Among the candidate genes in the significant ROHet regions, 16 genes related to growth, metabolism, and meat quality were considered as candidate genes for important economic traits of pigs. This work preliminarily explores the effect of heterozygosity-rich regions in the pig genome on production performance and provides new insights for subsequent research on pig genetic improvement.	0
34852955	Identification by volatolomics of hydrocarbon, oxygenated, sulfur and aromatic markers of livestock exposure to α-hexabromocyclododecane.	Volatile organic compounds (VOC)-based metabolomics, or volatolomics, was investigated for revealing livestock exposure to chemical contamination. Three farm animals, namely laying hens, broilers, and pigs, were experimentally exposed to 5 or 50 ng α-HBCDD g-1 feed. Liver and egg yolk for hens were analysed by headspace-SPME-GC-MS to reveal candidate markers of the livestock exposure to α-HBCDD. For hens, 2-butanol was found as marker in egg. In liver, twelve VOCs were highlighted as markers, with three aromatic VOCs - styrene, o-xylene, α-methylstyrene - highlighted for the two α-HBCDD doses. For broilers, six markers were revealed, with interestingly, styrene and phenol which were also found as markers in hen liver. For pigs, ten markers were revealed and the seven  tentatively identified markers were oxygenated and sulfur VOCs. The candidate markers tentatively identified were discussed in light of previous volatolomics data, in particular from a γ-HBCDD exposure of laying hens.	0
35159307	Comparative Transcriptomic Profiles of Differentiated Adipocytes Provide Insights into Adipogenesis Mechanisms of Subcutaneous and Intramuscular Fat Tissues in Pigs.	Subcutaneous fat thickness and intramuscular fat content are closely related to meat production and quality in the pig industry. Adipogenesis in adipocytes from  subcutaneous and intramuscular fat tissues involves different genes and regulatory mechanisms. Analyzing the data of mRNA and miRNA transcriptomes during the differentiation of adipocytes from these two sources will help identify the different mechanisms of subcutaneous and intramuscular fat deposition. In this study, RNA sequencing technology was used to analyze the differential expression  of genes and miRNAs in subcutaneous and intramuscular adipocytes at days 0, 2, 4, and 8 of differentiation. We mainly attributed the difference between fat depositions of the two types of adipocytes to variations in the expression patterns of related genes. Through combined weighted gene co-expression network analysis and K-MEANS, we identified 30 and 22 genes that mainly regulated the differentiation of subcutaneous adipocytes and intramuscular adipocytes, respectively. A total of 17 important candidate miRNAs were identified. This study provides valuable reference for the study of different mechanisms of adipogenesis among subcutaneous and intramuscular fat and contributes to improving pig breeding.	0
34935650	Reliable Assessment of Swine Renal Fibrosis Using Quantitative Magnetization Transfer Imaging.	OBJECTIVES: Quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) is useful for measurement of murine renal fibrosis at high and ultrahigh field strengths. However, its utility at clinical field strengths and in human-like kidneys remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that qMT would successfully detect fibrosis in swine kidneys with unilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS) at 3.0 T. METHODS: The qMT protocol is composed of MT scans with variable flip angles and offset frequencies, and of B0, B1, and T1 mapping. Pigs were scanned 10 weeks after RAS or control. A 2-pool model was used to fit the bound pool fraction f of the renal cortex (CO) and outer medulla (OM). Then qMT-derived f in 5 normal and  10 RAS pigs was compared with histological fibrosis determined using Masson's trichrome staining and to renal perfusion assessed with computed tomography. RESULTS: The qMT 2-pool model provided accurate fittings of data collected on swine kidneys. Stenotic kidneys showed significantly elevated f in both the CO (9.8% ± 2.7% vs 6.4% ± 0.9%, P = 0.002) and OM (7.6% ± 2.2% vs 4.7% ± 1.1%, P = 0.002), as compared with normal kidneys. Histology-measured renal fibrosis and qMT-derived f correlated directly in both the cortex (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.93, P < 0.001) and OM (r = 0.84, P = 0.002), and inversely with stenotic kidney perfusion (r = 0.85, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of qMT for measuring fibrosis in human-like swine kidneys, and the association between tissue macromolecule content and renal perfusion. Therefore, qMT may be useful as a tool for noninvasive assessment of renal fibrosis in subjects with RAS at clinical field strengths.	0
34996689	Comparison of four equations for estimation of glomerular filtration rate in predicting cardiovascular events and subclinical vascular disease in patients with type-2 diabetes.	AIMS: Chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined by a low glomerular filtration rate (GFR), is a predictor of cardiovascular disease in patients with type-2 diabetes  (T2D). We aimed to compare four GFR equations in predicting future cardiovascular events in T2D and the presence of subclinical vascular disease. METHODS: Four equations were used to estimate GFR in asymptomatic T2D patients consulting our centre for cardiovascular assessment. Follow-up was performed to collect cardiovascular events. Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) was used to build and compare prediction models, and the incremental value of the addition of GFR with any of the 4 formulas was evaluated. The ability to triage patients with and without CVD events according to GFR were assessed by comparing the receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves with the 4 models. RESULTS: Among 829 asymptomatic T2D patients, the CKD prevalence was 20.2% for Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), 17.3% for Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI), 20.7% for Lund-Malmö Revised (LMR) and 21.4% for Full Age Spectrum (FAS). All the estimated GFRs were well correlated from one formula to another, with stronger agreement to define CKD (GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) between MDRD and CKD-EPI, and between LMR and FAS. The 5-year incidence of cardiovascular events was 8% (n = 63). After adjustment on covariables, CKD was significantly associated with cardiovascular events when defined by MDRD (HR = 2.04; 1.15-3.60) and CKD-EPI (HR = 1.90; 1.05-3.41) but missed statistical significance when using LMR (HR = 1.74; 0.97-3.14) or FAS (HR = 1.71; 0.94-3.14). Only the prediction models including MDRD and CKD-EPI provided a significant incremental information to the predictive model without GFR, but the area under the ROC curves were similar with the 4 models: 0.60 [0.54-0.68] for MDRD, 0.61 [0.49-0.65] for CKD-EPI and 0.62 [0.55-0.69] for LMR and FAS, without any significant difference among formulas. CONCLUSION: In asymptomatic T2D patients, MDRD and CKD-EPI may be preferable when more specificity is desired (stronger association between GFR and CVD events), while LMR and FAS appear more sensitive by including a higher number of patients  with GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2.	0
35289986	Tri-Layered and Gel-Like Nanofibrous Scaffolds with Anisotropic Features for Engineering Heart Valve Leaflets.	3D heterogeneous and anisotropic scaffolds that approximate native heart valve tissues are indispensable for the successful construction of tissue engineered heart valves (TEHVs). In this study, novel tri-layered and gel-like nanofibrous scaffolds, consisting of poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) and poly(aspartic acid) (PASP), are fabricated by a combination of positive/negative conjugate electrospinning and bioactive hydrogel post-processing. The nanofibrous PLGA-PASP scaffolds present tri-layered structures, resulting in anisotropic mechanical properties that are comparable with native heart valve leaflets. Biological tests show that nanofibrous PLGA-PASP scaffolds with high PASP ratios significantly promote the proliferation and collagen and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) secretions of human aortic valvular interstitial cells (HAVICs), compared to PLGA scaffolds. Importantly, the nanofibrous PLGA-PASP scaffolds are found to effectively inhibit the osteogenic differentiation of HAVICs. Two types of porcine VICs, from young and adult age groups, are further seeded onto the PLGA-PASP scaffolds. The adult  VICs secrete higher amounts of collagens and GAGs and undergo a significantly higher level of osteogenic differentiation than young VICs. RNA sequencing analysis indicates that age has a pivotal effect on the VIC behaviors. This study provides important guidance and a reference for the design and development of 3D  tri-layered, gel-like nanofibrous PLGA-PASP scaffolds for TEHV applications.	0
35252426	Impact of a Regulation Restricting Critical Antimicrobial Usage on Prevalence of  Antimicrobial Resistance in Escherichia coli Isolates From Fecal and Manure Pit Samples on Dairy Farms in Québec, Canada.	To tackle antimicrobial resistance (AMR), one of the major health threats of this century, the World Health Organization (WHO) endorsed a global action plan in 2015. This plan calls countries to develop national actions to address AMR. The province of Québec, Canada, adopted a new regulation on the 25th of February 2019, to limit the use in food animals of antimicrobials of very high importance  in human medicine. We aimed to establish the impact of this regulation by comparing the AMR situation in dairy cattle in Québec ~2 years before and 2 years after its introduction. We sampled calves, cows, and the manure pit in 87 farms.  Generic and putative ESBL/AmpC E. coli were tested for susceptibility to 20 antimicrobials. Logistic regression was used to investigate whether the probability of antimicrobial resistance differed between isolates obtained from the pre and post regulation periods by sample type (calves, cows, manure pit) and in general. To identify AMR genes dissemination mechanisms, we sequenced the whole genome of 15 generic isolates. In the generic collection, at the herd level, the proportion of multidrug resistant (MDR) isolates, decreased significantly from 83 to 71% (p = 0.05). Folate inhibitor and aminoglycoside resistances demonstrated a significant decrease. However, when analyzed by sample type (calves, cows, manure pit), we did not observe a significant AMR decrease in any of these categories. In the ESBL/AmpC collection, we did not detect any significant difference between the two periods. Also, the general resistance gene profile was similar pre and post regulation. We identified both clonal and plasmidic dissemination of resistance genes. In conclusion, as early as 2 years post regulation implementation, we observed a significant decrease in MDR in the  dairy industry in Quebec in the generic E. coli collection with folate inhibitor  and aminoglycoside resistances showing the most significant decrease. No other significant decreases were yet observed.	0
35234713	Dimethyl Malonate Slows Succinate Accumulation and Preserves Cardiac Function in  a Swine Model of Hemorrhagic Shock.	BACKGROUND: Succinate (SI) is a citric acid cycle metabolite that accumulates in  tissues during hemorrhagic shock (HS) due to electron transport chain uncoupling. Dimethyl malonate (DMM) is a competitive inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase, which has been shown to reduce SI accumulation and protect against reperfusion injury. Whether DMM can be therapeutic after severe HS is unknown. We hypothesized that DMM would prevent SI buildup during resuscitation in a swine model of hemorrhagic shock, leading to better physiological recovery after resuscitation (RES). METHODS: The carotid arteries of Yorkshire pigs were cannulated with a 5-French catheter. After placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter and femoral arterial line, the  carotid catheters were opened and the animals were exsanguinated to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 45 mm. After 30 minutes in the shock state, the animals were resuscitated to a MAP of 60 mm using lactated ringers. A MAP above 60 mm was maintained throughout RES. One group received 10 mg/kg of DMM (n = 6) while the control received sham injections (n = 6). The primary end-point was SI  levels. Secondary end-points included cardiac function and lactate. RESULTS: SI levels increased from baseline to the 20-minute RES point in control, while the DMM cohort remained unchanged. The DMM group required less IV fluid to  maintain a MAP above 60 (450.0 vs. 229.0 mL, p = 0.01). The DMM group had higher  pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at the 20 and 40-minute RES points. The DMM group had better recovery of cardiac output and index during RES, while the control had no improvement. While lactate levels were similar, DMM may lead to increased ionized calcium levels. DISCUSSION: DMM slows SI accumulation during HS and helps preserve cardiac filling pressures and function during RES. In addition, DMM may protect against depletion of ionized calcium. DMM may have therapeutic potential during HS.	0
34879859	PIG-A gene mutation as a genotoxicity biomaker in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-exposed barbecue workers.	BACKGROUND: The PIG-A gene mutation assay is a valuable tool for measuring in vivo gene mutations in blood cells. The human PIG-A assay, used as a potential genotoxicity biomarker, is minimally invasive, sensitive, and cost-efficient; however, the relationship between carcinogen exposure and PIG-A mutations is not  well understood. METHODS: We investigated the genotoxic effect of red blood cells using PIG-A assay and lymphocyte cytokinesis-block micronucleus test in barbecue restaurant workers (N = 70) exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and self-identified healthy control subjects (N = 56). Urinary PAH metabolites were measured to evaluate internal exposure levels. RESULTS: Multivariate Poisson regression showed that the PAH-exposed workers exhibited significantly higher PIG-A mutant frequency (MF) (8.04 ± 6.81 × 10- 6)  than did the controls (5.56 ± 5.26 × 10- 6) (RR = 0.707, 95% CI: 0.615-0.812, P < 0.001). These results indicate that PAH exposure is a risk factor for elevated PIG-A MF. The frequencies of micronuclei (MN) and nuclear buds (NBUD) in the PAH-exposed workers (MN: 3.06 ± 2.07 ‰, NBUD: 1.38 ± 1.02 ‰) were also significantly higher than in the controls (MN: 1.46 ± 0.64 ‰, P < 0.001; NBUD: 0.70 ± 0.60 ‰, P < 0.001). Additionally, PIG-A MFs showed better associations with several urinary hydroxylated PAH metabolites (P2-OH-Flu = 0.032, r2-OH-Flu = 0. 268; P2-OH-Phe = 0.022, r2-OH-Phe = 0.286; P3-OH-Phe = 0.0312, r3-OH-Phe = 0.270; P4-OH-Phe = 0.018, r4-OH-Phe = 0.296), while the increase in MN, NPB, and NBUD frequencies was not associated with any OH-PAH metabolites; and high-PAH-exposed workers showed the highest PIG-A MFs. Furthermore, there was a significant association between PIG-A MF and PAH exposure levels (Chi-square test for trend, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that an increase in PIG-A MF in barbecue workers could reflect the response to PAH exposure, providing evidence of its potential as a genotoxicity biomarker in human risk assessment.	0
34983523	The recombinant pseudorabies virus expressing porcine deltacoronavirus spike protein is safe and effective for mice.	BACKGROUND: Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a new pathogenic porcine intestinal coronavirus, which has appeared in many countries since 2012. PDCoV disease caused acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and death in piglets, resulted in significant economic loss to the pig industry. However, there is no commercially available vaccine for PDCoV. In this study, we constructed recombinant pseudorabies virus (rPRVXJ-delgE/gI/TK-S) expressing PDCoV spike (S)  protein and evaluated its safety and immunogenicity in mice. RESULTS: The recombinant strain rPRVXJ-delgE/gI/TK-S obtained by CRISPR/Cas gE gene editing technology and homologous recombination technology has genetic stability in baby hamster syrian kidney-21 (BHK-21) cells and is safe to mice. After immunizing mice with rPRVXJ-delgE/gI/TK-S, the expression levels of IFN-γ and IL-4 in peripheral blood of mice were up-regulated, the proliferation of spleen-specific T lymphocytes and the percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in  mice spleen was increased. rPRVXJ-delgE/gI/TK-S showed good immunogenicity for mice. On the seventh day after booster immunity, PRV gB and PDCoV S specific antibodies were detected in mice, and the antibody level continued to increase, and the neutralizing antibody level reached the maximum at 28 days post- immunization (dpi). The recombinant strain can protect mice with 100% from the challenge of virulent strain (PRV XJ) and accelerate the detoxification of PDCoV  in mice. CONCLUSION: The recombinant rPRVXJ-delgE/gI/TK-S strain is safe and effective with strong immunogenicity and is expected to be a candidate vaccine against PDCoV and PRV.	0
35178130	Endothelin-Converting Enzyme 1 and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor as Potential Biomarkers during Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion with Prolonged Hypothermic Lung-Sparing.	Lung transplantation requires optimization of donor's organ use through ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) to avoid primary graft dysfunction. Biomarkers can aid in organ selection by providing early evidence of suboptimal lungs during EVLP and thus avoid high-risk transplantations. However, predictive biomarkers of pulmonary graft function such as endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have not been described under EVLP with standard prolonged hypothermic preservation, which are relevant in situations where lung procurement is difficult or far from the transplantation site. Therefore, this study is aimed at quantifying ECE-1 and VEGF, as well as determining their association with hemodynamic, gasometric, and mechanical ventilatory parameters in a swine model of EVLP with standard prolonged hypothermic preservation. Using a protocol with either immediate (I-) or delayed  (D-) initiation of EVLP, ECE-1 levels over time were found to remain constant in  both study groups (p > 0.05 RM-ANOVA), while the VEGF protein was higher after prolonged preservation, but it decreased throughout EVLP (p > 0.05 RM-ANOVA). Likewise, hemodynamic, gasometric, mechanical ventilatory, and histological parameters had a tendency to better results after 12 hours of hypothermic preservation in the delayed infusion group.	0
35016714	Role of airway smooth muscle cell phenotypes in airway tone and obstruction in guinea pig asthma model.	BACKGROUND: Airway obstruction (AO) in asthma is driven by airway smooth muscle (ASM) contraction. AO can be induced extrinsically by direct stimulation of ASM with contractile agonists as histamine, or by indirect provocation with antigens  as ovalbumin, while the airway tone is dependent on intrinsic mechanisms. The association of the ASM phenotypes involved in different types of AO and airway tone in guinea pigs was evaluated. METHODS: Guinea pigs were sensitized to ovalbumin and challenged with antigen. In each challenge, the maximum OA response to ovalbumin was determined, and before the challenges, the tone of the airways. At third challenge, airway responsiveness (AR) to histamine was evaluated and ASM cells from trachea were disaggregated to determinate: (a) by flow cytometry, the percentage of cells that express transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), interleukin-13 (IL-13) and sarco-endoplasmic Ca2+ ATPase-2b (SERCA2b), (b) by RT-PCR, the SERCA2B gene expression, (c) by ELISA, reduced glutathione (GSH) and, (d) Ca2+ sarcoplasmic reticulum refilling rate by microfluorometry. Control guinea pig group received saline instead ovalbumin. RESULTS: Antigenic challenges in sensitized guinea pigs induced indirect AO, AR to histamine and increment in airway tone at third challenge. No relationship was observed between AO induced by antigen and AR to histamine with changes in airway tone. The extent of antigen-induced AO was associated with both, TGF-β1 expression in ASM and AR degree. The magnitude of AR and antigen-induced AO showed an inverse correlation with GSH levels in ASM. The airway tone showed an inverse association with SERCA2b expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that each type of AO and airway tone depends on different ASM phenotypes: direct and indirect AO seems to be sensitive to the level of oxidative stress; indirect obstruction induced by antigen appears to be  influenced by the expression of TGF-β1 and the SERCA2b expression level plays a role in the airway tone.	0
35458465	Molecular Characterization of Small Ruminant Lentiviruses Isolated from Polish Goats with Arthritis.	Previous studies revealed that the small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) population in Poland is highly heterogeneous. All SRLVs detected from Polish sheep and goats so far have belonged to subtypes B1, B2, A1, A5, A12, A13, A16, A17, A18, A23 and A24. However, all characterized strains originated from asymptomatic animals. This is the first study that characterizes the molecular properties of SRLVs isolated from different organs of six arthritic goats. Segments from three genomic regions (gag, LTR and env) were analyzed. In addition, we quantified the  SRLV proviral load in the blood and different organs and examined its association with different degrees of histopathological lesions. All sequences obtained from  the goats involved in this study were homogeneous, showing an average degree of variability of 4.8%, 3.7% and 8.8% for gag, LTR and env, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the sequences from the analyzed goats were clustered within SRLVs group A and formed a new subtype within this group, tentatively named A27. The histopathological examination of the lung, mammary gland, synovial membranes of joints and brain of the analyzed goats revealed evidence of inflammatory processes associated with SRLV infection, which was confirmed by positive immunohistochemistry assays. No significant correlation was observed between histological features and alterations in the sequences from different tissues. No tissue-specific signature pattern was identified. It was shown that animals with a higher proviral load showed more lesion severity in various SRLV-affected tissues, indicating a positive association between these two parameters. Our results also revealed differences in the SRLV load between animals even though the sequences derived from all of the goats were closely related, suggesting that host factors may restrict and control viral replication. This study provides new information about SRLV variants isolated from arthritic goats; however, more studies, including the isolation and characterization of biological properties of these viruses, should be performed to evaluate their pathogenic potential.	0
35325756	A 12-bp indel in the 3'UTR of porcine CISH gene associated with Landrace piglet diarrhea score.	Variations in Cytokine inducible SH2-containing protein (CISH) gene influence human susceptibility to common infectious diseases, but little is known about CISH in swine. The objectives of this study were to 1) determine porcine CISH (pCISH) mRNA expression level in different tissues of piglets, 2) predict putative functional genetic variations within pCISH, 3) investigate the association between a identified variation in the 3'UTR and piglets phenotype traits in Min (n = 226) and Landrace (n = 186) population, and explore the function of this variation. Results of quantitative PCR showed pCISH mRNA expressed in all the collected tissues with higher level in lung and ileum than colon (p < 0.05). In-silico analysis indicated none of the functional ns-SNPs existed in pCISH coding region. Results from the characterizing of 3'UTR presented a novel 12-bp insertion/deletion (indel) mutation. Statistical analysis demonstrated that this 12-bp indel associated with piglets diarrhea score in the  Landrace population, and animals with AA genotype (12-bp insertion) presented lower diarrhea score when compared with BB (p < 0.05) or AB (p < 0.01) carriers.  The in vitro study indicated that the luciferase activity of reconstruct plasmid  psiCHECK-2-CISH-AA or psiCHECK-2-CISH-BB was significantly lower than the negative control (p < 0.05), and luciferase activity of psiCHECK-2-CISH-AA was higher than that of the psiCHECK-2-CISH-BB (p < 0.05). Although results herein suggested the 12-bp indel might affect Landrace piglet susceptibility to diarrhea, further association studies in more populations are needed before this  preliminary finding could be used for pig breeding.	0
34896249	Lactobacillus acidophilus ameliorates obesity in mice through modulation of gut microbiota dysbiosis and intestinal permeability.	Obesity associated with low-grade chronic inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis is considered as a worldwide public health crisis. In the meanwhile, different probiotics have demonstrated beneficial effects on this condition, thus increasing the interest in the development of probiotic treatments. In this context, the aim of this study is to investigate the anti-obesity effects of potential probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus isolated from the porcine gut. Then, it is found that L. acidophilus reduces body weight, fat mass, inflammation and insulin resistance in mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD), accompanied by activation in brown adipose tissue (BAT) as well as improvements of energy, glucose and lipid metabolism. Besides, our data indicate that L. acidophilus not  only reverses HFD-induced gut dysbiosis, as indicated by the decreased Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratios and endotoxin bearing Gram-negative bacteria levels, but also maintains intestinal barrier integrity, reduces metabolic endotoxemia, and inhibits the TLR4 / NF- κB signaling pathway. In addition, the results of microbiome phenotype prediction by BugBase and bacterial functional potential prediction using PICRUSt show that L. acidophilus treatment improves the gut microbiota functions involving metabolism, immune response, and pathopoiesia. Furthermore, the anti-obesity effect is transmissible via horizontal faeces transfer from L. acidophilus-treated mice to HFD-fed mice. According to our data, it is seen that L. acidophilus could be a good candidate for probiotic of ameliorating obesity and associated diseases such as hyperlipidemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases, and insulin resistance through its anti-inflammatory properties and alleviation of endothelial dysfunction and gut dysbiosis.	0
35436549	Metabolic conjugation reduces in vitro toxicity of the flavonoid nevadensin.	The present study focuses on the association between metabolic capacity and toxicity of the natural occurring flavonoid nevadensin in vitro. Human colon (HT29), liver (HepG2) and bone marrow (KG1) carcinoma cells were used and strong  cell line dependent differences in toxic effect strength were found. HepG2 and KG1 cells were more sensitive against nevadensin treatment in comparison to HT29 cells. High resolution mass spectrometry experiments showed that nevadensin  is rapidly glucuronidated in HT29 cells, whereas KG1 cells do not metabolize nevadensin, thus glucuronidation was supposed to be a crucial metabolic pathway in vitro. To proof this suggestion, nevadensin glucuronides were isolated from pig liver microsomes und structurally elucidated via NMR spectroscopy. In HepG2 cells a cellular enrichment of nevadensin itself as well as nevadensin-7-O-glucuronide was determined by tandem mass spectrometry. A proteomic screening of uridine 5'-diphospho (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) in HT29 and HepG2 cells provided first hints that the isoforms UGT1A6 and UGT1A1  are responsible for nevadensin glucuronidation. Additionally, nevadensin was found to be a potent SULT inhibitor in HepG2 cells. In sum, the present study clearly illustrates the importance of obtaining detailed information about metabolic competence of cell lines which should be considered in the evaluation of toxic endpoints.	0
34967057	The 2021 IXA Keith Reemtsma Lecture: Moving xenotransplantation to the clinic.	Keith Reemtsma was a pioneer in xenotransplantation, the Honorary Founding President of the International Xenotransplantation Association (in 1998), and a wonderful personality. It is a privilege to be invited to give this lecture in his memory. If he were alive today, he would be delighted to see the progress that has been made in pig organ transplantation into nonhuman primate recipients. This progress has largely resulted from two major advances: (i) the increasing availability of pigs with multiple genetic manipulations aimed at protecting the  cells of the organ from the primate immune response and (ii) the introduction of  novel immunosuppressive agents that block the CD40/CD154 costimulation pathway. There is strong evidence from numerous in vitro studies that the transplantation  of a triple-knockout pig organ, particularly if expressing several human protective proteins, into a patient is likely to be significantly more successful than if that same organ is transplanted into a nonhuman primate recipient. With this fact in mind, and in view of the advances currently being made, the time has surely come when we need to consider moving from the laboratory to the clinic. However, there are still questions we need to definitively resolve: (i) What exact genetic modifications do we need in the organ-source pig? (ii) What exact immunosuppressive regimen will we choose? (iii) How will we monitor the immune response and diagnose and treat rejection? and (iv) How do we plan to prevent or  treat potential infectious complications? Furthermore, when these matters have been resolved, which patients will be offered a pig organ in the first trial? We  have suggested that patients who are very unlikely to survive until a suitable deceased human donor kidney becomes available are those who should be considered  for the initial trials. Assessing public attitudes to xenotransplantation is also important before embarking on a clinical trial. I suggest that progress is much more likely to be made from a small clinical trial than if we persist in carrying out experiments in an animal model that no longer mimics the clinical situation.	0
35327109	Assessment of Chilling Injury in Boar Spermatozoa by Kinematic Patterns and Competitive Sperm-Oviduct Binding In Vitro.	Sensitive detection of chilling injury in boar spermatozoa is required to evaluate novel hypothermic preservation concepts. The study's aim was to examine  whether analyses of motility patterns and sperm binding in a competitive oviduct  explant assay (cOEA) sensitively detect chilling-induced alterations in sperm function. Semen samples (n = seven boars) were split into four subsamples by dilution either in Beltsville Thawing Solution (BTS) or Androstar® Plus and stored at 5 °C or 17 °C. Storage temperature had a significant effect on the distribution of spermatozoa in seven major kinematic clusters. The effect size of chilling at 5 °C as estimated by Cramer's V was higher (p &lt; 0.05) in the BTS medium (0.21) compared to AndroStar® Plus (0.11). Spermatozoa extended in Androstar® Plus had higher relative binding capacity compared to sperm in BTS (p  &lt; 0.05). Binding indices correlated with the percentage of viable, acrosome-intact (r = 0.62) and motile spermatozoa (r = 0.72, both p &lt; 0.001).  The cluster size of sperm with slow, vigorous movement was negatively correlated  with sperm-oviduct binding (r = -0.43, p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, the cluster analysis of sperm kinematics and competitive sperm oviduct binding in vitro present meaningful biological tests to assess novel concepts for hypothermic semen preservation.	0
35142398	Intracardiac MR imaging (ICMRI) guiding-sheath with amplified expandable-tip imaging and MR-tracking for navigation and arrythmia ablation monitoring: Swine testing at 1.5 and 3T.	"PURPOSE: Develop a deflectable intracardiac MR imaging (ICMRI) guiding-sheath to  accelerate imaging during MR-guided electrophysiological (EP) interventions for radiofrequency (500 kHz) ablation (RFA) of arrythmia. Requirements include imaging at three to five times surface-coil SNR in cardiac chambers, vascular insertion, steerable-active-navigation into cardiac chambers, operation with ablation catheters, and safe levels of MR-induced heating. METHODS: ICMRI's 6 mm outer-diameter (OD) metallic-braided shaft had a 2.6 mm OD  internal lumen for ablation-catheter insertion. Miniature-Baluns (MBaluns) on ICMRI's 1 m shaft reduced body-coil-induced heating. Distal section was a folded  ""star""-shaped imaging-coil mounted on an expandable frame, with an integrated miniature low-noise-amplifier overcoming cable losses. A handle-activated movable-shaft expanded imaging-coil to 35 mm OD for imaging within cardiac-chambers. Four MR-tracking micro-coils enabled navigation and motion-compensation, assuming a tetrahedron-shape when expanded. A second handle-lever enabled distal-tip deflection. ICMRI with a protruding deflectable EP catheter were used for MR-tracked navigation and RFA using a dedicated 3D-slicer user-interface. ICMRI was tested at 3T and 1.5T in swine to evaluate (a) heating, (b) cardiac-chamber access, (c) imaging field-of-view and SNR, and (d) intraprocedural RFA lesion monitoring. RESULTS: The 3T and 1.5T imaging SNR demonstrated >400% SNR boost over a 4 × 4 ×  4 cm3 FOV in the heart, relative to body and spine arrays. ICMRI with MBaluns met ASTM/IEC heating limits during navigation. Tip-deflection allowed navigating ICMRI and EP catheter into atria and ventricles. Acute-lesion long-inversion-time-T1-weighted 3D-imaging (TWILITE) ablation-monitoring using ICMRI required 5:30 min, half the time needed with surface arrays alone. CONCLUSION: ICMRI assisted EP-catheter navigation to difficult targets and accelerated RFA monitoring."	0
35000615	Epidemiology of Astrovirus, Norovirus and Sapovirus in Greek pig farms indicates  high prevalence of Mamastrovirus suggesting the potential need for systematic surveillance.	BACKROUND: Astrovirus, Norovirus and Sapovirus exhibit a wide distribution in swine pig herds worldwide. However, the association of porcine Astrovirus (PAstV), porcine Norovirus (PoNoV) and porcine Sapovirus (PoSaV) with disease in  pigs remains uncertain. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of PAstV, PoNoV and PoSaV in Greek pig farms using both conventional RT-PCR and SYBR-Green  Real-time RT-PCR in an effort to compare the sensitivity of the two methods. We examined 1400 stool samples of asymptomatic pigs originating from 28 swine farms  throughout Greece in pools of five. RESULTS: PAstV was detected in all 28 swine farms examined, with an overall prevalence of 267/280 positive pools (95.4%). Porcine Caliciviruses prevalence was found at 36 and 57 out of the 280 examined samples, by the conventional and SYBR-Green Real time RT-PCR, respectively. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the positive samples revealed that the detected PAstV sequences are clustered  within PAstV1, 3 and 4 lineages, with PAstV3 being the predominant haplotype (91.2%). Interestingly, sequencing of the Calicivirus positive samples demonstrated the presence of non-target viruses, i.e. Sapovirus, Kobuvirus and Sapelovirus sequences and one sequence highly similar to bat Astrovirus, while no Norovirus sequence was detected. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of PAstV in Greek pig farms poses a necessity for further investigation of the pathogenicity of this virus and its inclusion in surveillance programs in case that it proves to be important. To our knowledge, this is the first epidemiological study of these viruses in pig farms in Greece.	0
35410129	Identification of circRNA-associated ceRNA networks using longissimus thoracis of pigs of different breeds and growth stages.	BACKGROUND: Long-term artificial selection for growth rate and lean meat rate has eventually led to meat quality deterioration. Muscle fiber type is a key factor that markedly affects meat quality. circRNAs have been reported to participate in diverse biological activities, including myofiber growth and development; thus, we herein compared porcine circRNA transcriptome between oxidative and glycolytic muscle tissues. RESULTS: Longissimus thoracis muscle tissues were obtained from Lantang and Landrace pigs at birth (LT1D and LW1D, respectively) and 90 postnatal days (LT90D and LW90D, respectively). Hematoxylin and eosin staining and quantitative real-time PCR revealed that all structural traits of the muscle showed large variations between different breeds and growth stages. In total, 329 known miRNAs and 42,081 transcript candidates were identified; 6,962 differentially expressed  transcripts were found to play a key role in myogenesis by gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses. In addition, 3,352 circRNAs were identified using five predicting algorithms, and 104 circRNA candidates were differentially expressed. Integrated analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs, mRNAs, and circRNAs led to the identification of 777, 855, and  22 convincing ceRNA interactions in LT1D vs. LT90D, LW1D vs. LW90D, and LT90D vs. LW90D, respectively. Finally, we identified a circRNA candidate circKANSL1L, which showed high homology between mice and pigs, and it was found to inhibit the proliferation of C2C12 cells but promote their differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: We identified genome-wide circRNAs in 0- and 90-day-old Lantang and  Landrace pigs by RNA-seq and found that circRNAs were abundant, differentially expressed, and associated with myogenesis. Our results should serve as a reference for future studies on pork quality.	0
34864146	Reannotation of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae hypothetical proteins revealed novel potential virulence factors.	Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is a bacterium that inhabits the swine respiratory tract, causing porcine enzootic pneumonia, which generates significant economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. The knowledge on M. hyopneumoniae biology and virulence have been significantly increased by genomics studies. However, around 30% of the predicted proteins remained of unknown function so far. According to the original annotation, the genome of M. hyopneumoniae 7448, a Brazilian pathogenic strain, had 693 coding DNA sequences, 244 of which were annotated as coding for hypothetical or uncharacterized proteins. Among them, there may be still several genes coding for unknown virulence factors. Therefore, this study aimed to functionally reannotate the whole set of 244 M. hyopneumoniae 7448 proteins of unknown function based on currently available database and bioinformatic tools, in order to predict novel potential virulence factors. Predictions of physicochemical properties, subcellular localization, function, overall association to virulence and antigenicity are provided. With that, 159 out of the set of 244 proteins of unknown function had a putative function associated to them, allowing identification of novel enzymes, membrane transporters, lipoproteins, DNA-binding proteins and adhesins. Furthermore, 139 proteins were generally associated to virulence, 14 of which had a function assigned and were differentially expressed between pathogenic and non-pathogenic  strains of M. hyopneumoniae. Moreover, all extracellular or cytoplasmic membrane  predicted proteins had putative epitopes identified. Overall, these analyses improved the functional annotation of M. hyopneumoniae 7448 genome from 65% to 87% and allowed the identification of new potential virulence factors.	0
34979897	Evaluation of the phenotypic and genomic background of variability based on litter size of Large White pigs.	BACKGROUND: The genetic background of trait variability has captured the interest of ecologists and animal breeders because the genes that control it could be involved in buffering various environmental effects. Phenotypic variability of a  given trait can be assessed by studying the heterogeneity of the residual variance, and the quantitative trait loci (QTL) that are involved in the control  of this variability are described as variance QTL (vQTL). This study focuses on litter size (total number born, TNB) and its variability in a Large White pig population. The variability of TNB was evaluated either using a simple method, i.e. analysis of the log-transformed variance of residuals (LnVar), or the more complex double hierarchical generalized linear model (DHGLM). We also performed a single-SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) genome-wide association study (GWAS). To our knowledge, this is only the second study that reports vQTL for litter size in pigs and the first one that shows GWAS results when using two methods to evaluate variability of TNB: LnVar and DHGLM. RESULTS: Based on LnVar, three candidate vQTL regions were detected, on Sus scrofa chromosomes (SSC) 1, 7, and 18, which comprised 18 SNPs. Based on the DHGLM, three candidate vQTL regions were detected, i.e. two on SSC7 and one on SSC11, which comprised 32 SNPs. Only one candidate vQTL region overlapped between the two methods, on SSC7, which also contained the most significant SNP. Within this vQTL region, two candidate genes were identified, ADGRF1, which is involved  in neurodevelopment of the brain, and ADGRF5, which is involved in the function of the respiratory system and in vascularization. The correlation between estimated breeding values based on the two methods was 0.86. Three-fold cross-validation indicated that DHGLM yielded EBV that were much more accurate and had better prediction of missing observations than LnVar. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that the LnVar and DHGLM methods resulted in genetically different traits. Based on their validation, we recommend the use of  DHGLM over the simpler method of log-transformed variance of residuals. These conclusions can be useful for future studies on the evaluation of the variability of any trait in any species.	0
34977444	Prevalence, Distribution, and Genotypes of Adenovirus and Norovirus in the Puzi River and Its Tributaries and the Surrounding Areas in Taiwan.	This study investigated the prevalence, distribution, and genotypes of adenoviruses (AdVs) and noroviruses (NoVs) in the Puzi River and surrounding areas in Taiwan. The viruses in the water samples were isolated using the membrane filtration method and the viral nucleic acids were extracted. The RNA of NoVs was reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. AdVs and NoVs were detected using nested PCR. Genotyping and phylogenetic analyses were performed to identify the various  viral genotypes in the water samples. Human adenovirus (HAdVs) and porcine adenovirus (PAdVs) were the predominant genotypes in the water samples. The prevalence of F species HAdVs serotype 41 (79.2%) and C species PAdVs serotype 5  (18.1%) was higher than that of other serotypes. Among NoVs, genogroup GII was more prevalent than GI. In particular, GII.4 (21.2%) and GII.17 (18.2%) were the  predominant genotypes, which was consistent with the clinical findings. The prevalence of both AdVs and NoVs was higher in the winter than spring, summer and autumn seasons. AdVs and NoVs detection results were statistically analyzed by investigating their association with water quality indicators. The results revealed that the presence of AdVs was significantly correlated with the heterotrophic bacterial count, total coliform Escherichia coli, turbidity, salinity, and dissolved oxygen. Meanwhile, the presence of NoVs was only significantly correlated with temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen. Microbial pollution sources may include urban runoff and discharge of water from livestock  farms situated near the river and tributaries within this region of Taiwan. Future studies should include comparisons of the presence of AdVs and NoVs in these known pollution sources and water quality monitoring of these watersheds, as this will allow potential identification of pollution sources. Additionally, remediation strategies must be developed to minimize viral contamination in the river ecosystem.	0
34957439	Genetic association of polymorphisms in porcine RGS16 with porcine circovirus viral load in naturally infected Yorkshire pigs.	Regulator of G protein signaling 16 (RGS16) is known to be associated with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). PCV2 associated disease (PCVAD) is a serious problem in the swine industry. The representative symptoms of PCVAD are high viral titer proliferation and decreased average daily gain. In this study, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the RGS16 region, including  the upstream region. Of the 22 identified SNPs, rs332913874, rs326071195, and rs318298586 were genotyped in 142 Yorkshire pigs. These SNPs were significantly associated with the PCV2 viral load. Moreover, the haplotype combination was also related to the PCV2 viral load. The haplotype and diplotype analysis also had a significant difference with the PCV2 viral load. Taken together, our results suggest that RGS16 SNPs considerably affect the PCV2 viral load.	0
35413946	Lungworms (Metastrongylus spp.) demonstrated in domestic pigs with respiratory disease: was there a clinical relevance?	BACKGROUND: An outdoor pig herd was affected by severe respiratory disease in one out of three pastures. At necropsy, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Pasteurella multocida were detected in the lungs, as well as the lung worm Metastrongylus apri. The life cycle of Metastrongylus spp. includes earthworms as intermediate hosts, and since domestic pigs mainly are reared indoors, lungworm infections have not been diagnosed in domestic pigs in Sweden for decades, not even in pigs  reared outdoors. Therefore, this disease outbreak was scrutinised from the view of validating the impact of Metastrongylus spp. RESULTS: At the time of the disease outbreak, neither eggs of Metastrongylus spp., Trichuris suis nor Ascaris suum were detected in faeces of pigs aged ten weeks. In contrast, five-months-old pigs at the pasture with respiratory disease  shed up to 3800 eggs per gram (Epg) of Ascaris suum and up to 1100 Epg of Trichuris suis, whereas eggs of these parasites were not demonstrated in healthy  pigs aged six months at another pasture. Low numbers of eggs from Metastrongylus  spp. (< 150 Epg) were seen in faecal samples from both these age categories. At slaughter, seven weeks later, ten normal weighted pigs in the preceding healthy batch were compared with ten normal weighted and five small pigs from the affected batch. Healing Mycoplasma-like pneumonic lesions were seen in all groups. All small pigs shed eggs of Ascaris suum in the faeces, compared to around 50% of the larger pigs. Metastrongylus spp. were demonstrated in 13 of the 25 pigs (52%), representing all groups included. CONCLUSION: As Metastrongylus spp. were demonstrated regardless of health status, and also in another healthy outdoor herd, the impact of Metastrongylus spp. on the outbreak of respiratory disease was depreciated. Instead, a possible association with a high burden of Ascaris suum was suggested to have preceded the severe outbreak with respiratory disease in the affected herd. Further, it was concluded that Metastrongylus spp. will escape detection at routine meat inspections made at slaughterhouses, and as they appeared to generally not induce clinical signs of respiratory disease Metastrongylus spp. may be more common in outdoor production than previously believed.	0
35405912	Differences in Fatty Acid Profile and Physical-Chemical Composition of Slavonska  slanina-Dry Cured Smoked Bacon Produced from Black Slavonian Pig and Modern Pigs.	The objective of this study was to compare the psysico-chemical composition and fatty acid (FFA) profile of traditional dry cured bacon Slavonska slanina, produced from the authentic Black Slavonian Pig (BP) and modern pigs (MP), using  traditional homemade principles. The samples of Slavonska slanina produced from BP had a significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher fat content (78.32%) than the samples produced from MP (46.47%), while the samples produced from MP showed significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) protein and moisture content. The samples produced from BP also showed lower aw and salt content but higher pH. Determination of fatty acid composition was performed at the end of the production process. The composition of fatty acids with respect to the groups of  saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids was determined, as well as the ratios n-6/n-3 and PUFA/SFA. The results of fatty  acid composition determination of Slavonska slanina produced from BP and MP show  that oleic acid (C18: 1n9) is the most dominant fatty acid from the MUFA group (47.02 and 46.25%), the most common SFA acid was palmitic acid (C16: 0) (23.44 and 24.96%), and PUFA linoleic acid (C18: 2n-6c) (10.76 and 9.74%). The genotype  had a significant (p &lt; 0.05) effect on the SFA and USFA composition of Slavonska slanina. The ratios PUFA/SFA (0.34-0.28) and n-6/n-3 (31.84-27.34) for  samples of Slavonska slanina produced from BP and MP are in concordance with previously published data for different dry cured meat products, and do not comply with the nutritionally recommended values of international health organizations (PUFA/SFA &gt; 0.4 and n-6/n-3 &lt; 4).	0
35074856	Basic fibroblast growth factor inhibits aortic valvular interstitial cells calcification via Notch1 pathway.	Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is an active pathological process mediated by abnormal activation and transdifferentiation of valvular interstitial cells (VICs). The present study aims to investigate the function and underlying mechanism of the basic fibroblast growth factor (BFGF) on osteogenic differentiation of VICs. Porcine VICs cultured with osteogenic induction medium are supplemented with or without BFGF. Morphology of VICs is identified by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin, the cell viability is assessed by  the cell counting kit-8 method, and protein and mRNA expression level of osteogenic differentiation markers, including Runx2, osteopontin, and Sp7, are verified by western blot analysis and quantitative real-time PCR, respectively. RNA sequencing is used to identify changes in gene profiles. Alizarin Red S staining is used to measure calcium deposition. The results demonstrate that the  content of calcium deposition and the expression level of osteogenic markers are  downregulated by supplementing BFGF. Notch1 signaling pathway is extracted as a candidate target after bioinformatics analysis by RNA sequencing. The transfection of si-Notch1 abolishes the calcification inhibitory effect of BFGF.  Taken together, our findings shed the light on the mechanism and potential therapeutics of BFGF for CAVD.	0
34961532	Surgical techniques for aortic valve xenotransplantation.	BACKGROUND: Heart valve replacement in neonates and infants is one of the remaining unsolved problems in cardiac surgery because conventional valve prostheses do not grow with the children. Similarly, heart valve replacement in children and young adults with contraindications to anticoagulation remains an unsolved problem because mechanical valves are thrombogenic and bioprosthetic valves are prone to early degeneration. Therefore, there is an urgent clinical need for growing heart valve replacements that are durable without the need for anticoagulation. METHODS: A human cadaver model was used to develop surgical techniques for aortic valve xenotransplantation. RESULTS: Aortic valve xenotransplantation is technically feasible. Subcoronary implantation of the valve avoids the need for a root replacement. CONCLUSION: Aortic valve xenotransplantation is promising because the development of GTKO.hCD46.hTBM transgenic pigs has brought xenotransplantation within clinical reach.	0
35202111	Tissular Genomic Responses to Oral FB1 Exposure in Pigs.	Fumonisin B1 (FB1) is a widespread mycotoxin produced by fungal Fusarium species-mainly in maize, one of the plants most commonly used for food and feed.  Pigs and horses are the animal species most susceptible to this mycotoxin. FB1 exposure can cause highly diverse clinical symptoms, including hepatotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and intestinal barrier function disturbance. Inhibition of ceramide synthetase is a well-understood ubiquitous molecular mechanism of FB1 toxicity, but other more tissue-specific effects remain to be elucidated. To investigate the effects of FB1 in different exposed tissues, we cross-analyzed the transcriptomes of fours organs: liver, jejunum, jejunal Peyer's patches, and  spleen. During a four-week study period, pigs were fed a control diet or a FB1-contaminated diet (10 mg/kg feed). In response to oral FB1 exposure, we observed common biological processes in the four organs, including predominant and recurrent processes (extracellular matrix organization, integrin activation,  granulocyte chemotaxis, neutrophil migration, and lipid and sterol homeostasis),  as well as more tissue-specific processes that appeared to be related to lipid outcomes (cell cycle regulation in jejunum, and gluconeogenesis in liver).	0
35033551	Determinants for antimicrobial resistance genes in farm dust on 333 poultry and pig farms in nine European countries.	Livestock feces with antimicrobial resistant bacteria reaches the farm floor, manure pit, farm land and wider environment by run off and aerosolization. Little research has been done on the role of dust in the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in farms. Concentrations and potential determinants of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in farm dust are at present not known. Therefore in this study absolute ARG levels, representing the levels people and animals might be exposed to, and relative abundances of ARGs, representing the levels in the bacterial population, were quantified in airborne farm dust using qPCR. Four ARGs were determined in 947 freshly settled farm dust samples, captured with electrostatic dustfall collectors (EDCs), from 174 poultry (broiler) and 159 pig farms across nine European countries. By using linear mixed modeling, associations with fecal ARG levels, antimicrobial use (AMU) and farm and animal related parameters were determined. Results show similar relative abundances in farm dust as in feces and a significant positive association (ranging between 0.21 and 0.82) between the two reservoirs. AMU in pigs was positively associated with ARG abundances in dust from the same stable. Higher biosecurity standards were associated with lower relative ARG abundances in poultry and higher relative ARG abundances in pigs. Lower absolute ARG levels in  dust were driven by, among others, summer season and certain bedding materials for poultry, and lower animal density and summer season for pigs. This study indicates different pathways that contribute to shaping the dust resistome in livestock farms, related to dust generation, or affecting the bacterial microbiome. Farm dust is a large reservoir of ARGs from which transmission to bacteria in other reservoirs can possibly occur. The identified determinants of ARG abundances in farm dust can guide future research and potentially farm management policy.	0
35169654	Genetic diversity of meat quality related genes in Argentinean pigs.	Genetic influence on pork quality exists between breeds and within a breed. The variation is caused by a large set of genes, and pork quality traits have a multifactorial background. Research into the genetics of meat quality found causative mutations associated with marked effects on pig meat value. This study  aimed to investigate the segregation of meat quality-related SNPs and compare their diversity and genetics in commercial and Creole pigs from different farms in the North-West of Argentina. A screen for SNPs in RYR1, PRKAG3, CAST, and SOX6 candidate genes and the differentiation of their genotypes by PCR-RFLP was conducted. All genes were characterized by a high level of polymorphism and heterozygosity, and populations showed no differences in the genetic structure for the analyzed SNPs. These results highlighted the role of pig genotypes as a source of basic variability potentially affecting processed meat products and fresh meat.	0
35098466	Transcriptomics and transmission ultrastructural examination reveals the nephrotoxicity of cadmium in laying hens.	The objective of this study was to reveal the effects of cadmium (Cd) on ultrastructural changes, oxidative stress, and transcriptome expression in the kidneys of laying hens. Seventy-two healthy Hy-Line brown laying hens at 41 weeks old were randomly allocated to four treatment groups with six replicates. The control group received a basal diet without additional Cd incorporation, and the  other three treatment groups received diets supplemented with 15, 30, or 60 mg Cd /kg of feed. After 6 weeks of exposure, the results show that administration of 60 mg/kg Cd significantly reduced (P < 0.05) eggshell thickness. With an increase in the Cd concentration in feed, the concentrations of renal Zn and Fe also had changed. Renal histopathology and ultrastructure also showed aggravated damage to glomeruli and renal tubules and the deformation of nuclei and mitochondria in all Cd treatment groups. With an increase in Cd in feed, the activity of glutathione  peroxide (GPX) and catalase (CAT) was significantly reduced (P < 0.05), while the activity of total antioxidant capacity (T -AOC) was decreased (P < 0.05) only in  the 60 mg/kg Cd group. RNA-seq analysis revealed that 410 genes displayed differential expression (≥ 1.5-fold) in the 60 mg/kg supplementation group, compared to the control group. GO and KEGG pathway analysis results showed that Cd affected many genes involved in mitochondria and ion transport. In conclusion, this study elaborates the mechanisms underlying renal toxicity caused by Cd, which might provide target candidate genes for alleviating Cd poisoning in laying hens.	0
35450598	Multielectrode Unipolar Voltage Mapping and Electrogram Morphology to Identify Post-Infarct Scar Geometry: Validation by Histology.	OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the ability of uni- and bipolar electrograms collected with a multielectrode catheter with smaller electrodes to: 1) delineate scar; and 2) determine local scar complexity. BACKGROUND: Early reperfusion results in variable endocardial scar, often overlaid with surviving viable myocardium. Although bipolar voltage (BV) mapping  is considered the pillar of substrate-based ablation, the role of unipolar voltage (UV) mapping has not been sufficiently explored. It has been suggested that bipolar electrograms collected with small electrode catheters can better identify complex scar geometries. METHODS: Twelve swine with early reperfusion infarctions were mapped with the 48-electrode OctaRay catheter and a conventional catheter during sinus rhythm. BV electrograms with double components were identified. Transmural (n = 933) biopsy  specimens corresponding to mapping points were obtained, histologically assessed, and classified by scar geometry. RESULTS: OctaRay UV (UVOcta) and BV (BVOcta) amplitude were associated with the amount of viable myocardium at a given location, with a stronger association for  UVOcta (R2 = 0.767 vs 0.473). Cutoff values of 3.7 mV and 1.0 mV could delineate  scar (area under the curve: 0.803 and 0.728 for UVOcta and BVOcta, respectively). The morphology of bipolar electrograms collected with the OctaRay catheter more frequently identified areas with 2 layers of surviving myocardium than electrograms collected with the conventional catheter (84% vs 71%). CONCLUSIONS: UV mapping can generate a map to delineate the area of interest when using a multielectrode catheter. Within this area of interest, the morphology of  bipolar electrograms can identify areas in which a surviving epicardial layer may overlay a poorly coupled, potentially arrhythmogenic, endocardium.	0
35287733	Associations between testicular development and fetal size in the pig.	BACKGROUND: Impaired reproductive performance is the largest contributing factor  for the removal of boars from commercial systems. Intrauterine growth restricted  piglets represent 25% of the total number of piglets born and have impaired reproductive performance. This study aimed to improve the understanding of temporal changes in testicular gene expression during testes development in fetuses of different size. The lightest and closest to mean litter weight (CTMLW) male Large White × Landrace littermates were collected at gestational days (GD) 45, 60 and 90 (n = 5-6 litters/GD). RESULTS: Testes weight and testes weight as a percentage of fetal weight were not associated with fetal size at GD60 or 90. Fetal plasma testosterone was not associated with fetal size at GD90. There was no association between fetal size and seminiferous tubule area and number, number of germ or Sertoli cells per tubule. The lightest fetuses tended to have wider seminiferous tubules compared to the CTMLW fetuses at GD90 (P = 0.077). The testicular expression of KI67 (P ≤ 0.01) and BAX:BCL2 ratio (P = 0.058) mRNAs decreased as gestation progressed. Greater SPP1 mRNA expression was observed at GD60 when compared with  GD45 and 90 (P ≤ 0.05). Lower expression of DMRT1 and SPP1 (P < 0.01) mRNAs was observed in testes associated with the lightest fetuses compared to the CTMLW fetuses at GD90. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide novel insights into the expression profiles of genes associated with testicular development and function. Further, these data suggest that programming of reproductive potential in IUGR boars occurs late in gestation, providing a platform for further mechanistic investigation.	0
35336894	Genetic Characteristics and Pathogenicity of a Novel Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus with a Naturally Occurring Truncated ORF3 Gene.	Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the major pathogen that causes diarrhea and high mortality in newborn piglets, with devastating impact on the pig industry. To further understand the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity  of PEDV field strains, in this study the complete genomes of four PEDV variants (HN2021, CH-HNYY-2018, CH-SXWS-2018, and CH-HNKF-2016) obtained from immunized pig farms in central China between 2016 to 2021 were characterized and analyzed.  Phylogenetic analysis of the genome and S gene showed that the four strains identified in the present study had evolved into the subgroup G2a, but were distant from the vaccine strain CV777. Additionally, it was noteworthy that a new PEDV strain (named HN2021) belonging to the G2a PEDV subgroup was successfully isolated in vitro and it was further confirmed by RT-PCR that this isolate had a  large natural deletion at 207-373 nt of the ORF3 gene, which has never been reported before. Particularly, in terms of pathogenicity evaluation, colostrum deprivation piglets challenged with PEDV HN2021 showed severe diarrhea and high mortality, confirming that PEDV HN2021 was a virulent strain. Hence, PEDV strain  HN2021 of subgroup G2a presents a promising vaccine candidate for the control of  recurring porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) in China. This study lays the foundation for better understanding of the genetic evolution and molecular pathogenesis of PEDV.	0
35078535	Cough associated with the detection of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae DNA in clinical and environmental specimens under controlled conditions.	BACKGROUND: The association of cough with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (MHP) DNA detection in specimens was evaluated under conditions in which the MHP status of  inoculated and contact-infected pen mates was closely monitored for 59 days post-inoculation (DPI). METHODS: Seven-week-old pigs (n = 39) were allocated to five rooms (with one pen). Rooms contained 9 pigs each, with 1, 3, 6, or 9 MHP-inoculated pigs, respectively, except Room 5 (three sham-inoculated pigs). Cough data (2 × week) and specimens, tracheal swabs (2 × week), oral fluids (daily), drinker wipes (~ 1 × week), and air samples (3 × week) were collected. At 59 DPI, pigs were euthanized, and lung and trachea were evaluated for gross and microscopic lesions. Predictive cough value to MHP DNA detection in drinker and oral fluid samples were estimated using mixed logistic regression. RESULTS: Following inoculation, MHP DNA was first detected in tracheal swabs from inoculated pigs (DPI 3), then oral fluids (DPI 8), air samples (DPI 10), and drinker wipes (21 DPI). MHP DNA was detected in oral fluids in 17 of 59 (Room 1)  to 43 of 59 (Room 3) samples, drinker wipes in 4 of 8 (Rooms 2 and 3) to 5 of 8 (Rooms 1 and 4) samples, and air samples in 5 of 26 (Room 2) or 3 of 26 (Room 4)  samples. Logistic regression showed that the frequency of coughing pigs in a pen  was associated with the probability of MHP DNA detection in oral fluids (P < 0.01) and nearly associated with drinker wipes (P = 0.08). Pathology data revealed an association between the period when infection was first detected and  the severity of gross lung lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Dry, non-productive coughs suggest the presence of MHP, but laboratory testing and MHP DNA detection is required for confirmation. Based on the data from this study, oral fluids and drinker wipes may provide a convenient  alternative for MHP DNA detection at the pen level when cough is present. This information may help practitioners in specimen selection for MHP surveillance.	0
35158627	Is There a Link between Vomeronasalitis and Aggression in Stable Social Groups of Female Pigs?	The vomeronasal organ (VNO) is a bilateral chemosensory structure strongly involved in animal behaviour, thanks to its sensory epithelium (VNSE) that detects pheromones. Experimental VNO lesions can impair social, reproductive and  maternal behaviour, while feline spontaneous vomeronasalitis has been associated  with aggression. This study aimed to describe vomeronasalitis in farm pigs and explore its association with intraspecific behavioural alterations. Using 38 six-month-old pigs, the skin lesion score based on Welfare Quality® protocols was obtained during the fattening period. The seventy-six VNOs from these pigs were stained in haematoxylin-eosin for histological examinations. VNSE inflammation was classified considering its intensity. Skin lesions data were compared to vomeronasalitis. There were 34% of pigs that showed unilateral VNSE inflammation, while 66% were bilaterally affected. The mean ± SD number of skin lesions/animal  was 4.4 ± 2.82, and 34% of pigs scored 1 (moderately wounded animals) at least once during the fattening period. Statistical analysis showed an association between bilateral vomeronasalitis and skin lesion score (p < 0.05) and between bilateral moderate vomeronasalitis and skin lesions number (p < 0.01). This is the first report linking vomeronasalitis to social life in farm animals. Considering the role of social life in animal welfare, our data opens a research  field linking pathology to animal behaviour.	0
34988935	A putative PCV3-associated disease in piglets from Southern Brazil.	Porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) is widely distributed worldwide, and its association with clinical disease in pigs has been studied in recent years. This  study describes a novel PCV3-associated clinical disease in piglets from Brazil.  Since September 2020, we received 48 piglets with large caudally rotated ears, weakness, and dyspnea. Most piglets were from gilts and died 1-5 days after birth. Two piglets that presented similar clinical signs and survived until 35-60 days had a marked decrease in growth rate. At post-mortem examination, the  lungs did not collapse due to marked interlobular edema. Microscopically, the main feature was multisystemic vasculitis characterized by lymphocytes and plasma cells infiltrating and disrupting the wall of vessels, lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, and encephalitis. Viral replication was confirmed in these lesions through in situ hybridization (ISH-RNA). Seventeen cases were positive for PCV3 in PCR analysis, and all samples tested negative for porcine circovirus (PCV1, and PCV2); porcine parvovirus (PPV1, 2, 5, and 6); atypical porcine pestivirus (APPV); porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRSV); and ovine herpesvirus-2 (OvHV-2). Phylogenetic analysis of the ORF2 sequence from five different pig farms showed that the PCV3a clade is circulating among Brazil's swineherds and causing neonatal piglet losses.

34867921	NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation Enhanced by TRIM25 is Targeted by the NS1 Protein of 2009 Pandemic Influenza A Virus.	Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-mediated interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) production is one of the crucial responses in innate immunity upon infection with viruses including influenza A virus (IAV) and is modulated by both viral and host cellular proteins. Among host proteins involved, we identified tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25)  as a positive regulator of porcine NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1β production.  TRIM25 achieved this function by enhancing the pro-caspase-1 interaction with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing caspase recruitment domain (ASC). The N-terminal RING domain, particularly residues predicted to be critical for the E3 ligase activity of TRIM25, was responsible for this enhancement. However, non-structural protein 1 (NS1) C-terminus of 2009 pandemic IAV interfered with this action by interacting with TRIM25, leading to diminished association between pro-caspase-1 and ASC. These findings demonstrate that TRIM25 promotes the IL-1β signaling, while it is repressed by IAV NS1 protein, revealing additional antagonism of the NS1 against host pro-inflammatory responses.	0
35168569	Large-scale association study on daily weight gain in pigs reveals overlap of genetic factors for growth in humans.	BACKGROUND: Imputation from genotyping array to whole-genome sequence variants using resequencing of representative reference populations enhances our ability to map genetic factors affecting complex phenotypes in livestock species. The accumulation of knowledge about gene function in human and laboratory animals can provide substantial advantage for genomic research in livestock species. RESULTS: In this study, 201,388 pigs from three commercial Danish breeds genotyped with low to medium (8.5k to 70k) SNP arrays were imputed to whole genome sequence variants using a two-step approach. Both imputation steps achieved high accuracies, and in total this yielded 26,447,434 markers on 18 autosomes. The average estimated imputation accuracy of markers with minor allele frequency ≥ 0.05 was 0.94. To overcome the memory consumption of running genome-wide association study (GWAS) for each breed, we performed within-breed subpopulation GWAS then within-breed meta-analysis for average daily weight gain  (ADG), followed by a multi-breed meta-analysis of GWAS summary statistics. We identified 15 quantitative trait loci (QTL). Our post-GWAS analysis strategy to prioritize of candidate genes including information like gene ontology, mammalian phenotype database, differential expression gene analysis of high and low feed efficiency pig and human GWAS catalog for height, obesity, and body mass index, we proposed MRAP2, LEPROT, PMAIP1, ENSSSCG00000036234, BMP2, ELFN1, LIG4 and FAM155A as the candidate genes with biological support for ADG in pigs. CONCLUSION: Our post-GWAS analysis strategy helped to identify candidate genes not just by distance to the lead SNP but also by multiple sources of biological evidence. Besides, the identified QTL overlap with genes which are known for their association with human growth-related traits. The GWAS with this large data set showed the power to map the genetic factors associated with ADG in pigs and have added to our understanding of the genetics of growth across mammalian species.	0
35448069	Porcine Models of Heart Regeneration.	Swine are popular large mammals for cardiac preclinical testing due to their similarities with humans in terms of organ size and physiology. Recent studies indicate an early neonatal regenerative capacity for swine hearts similar to small mammal laboratory models such as rodents, inspiring exciting possibilities  for studying cardiac regeneration with the goal of improved clinical translation  to humans. However, while swine hearts are anatomically similar to humans, fundamental differences exist in growth mechanisms, nucleation, and the maturation of pig cardiomyocytes, which could present difficulties for the translation of preclinical findings in swine to human therapeutics. In this review, we discuss the maturational dynamics of pig cardiomyocytes and their capacity for proliferative cardiac regeneration during early neonatal development to provide a perspective on swine as a preclinical model for developing cardiac gene- and cell-based regenerative therapeutics.	0
35176608	The swine enteric virome in a commercial production system and its association with neonatal diarrhea.	Swine are an important food source worldwide and producers may not always be aware of the variety of the pathogens infecting their herds, particularly viruses. In this study, 12 enteric viruses were monitored in a total of 181 diarrheic and healthy piglets; namely porcine astrovirus groups 1-5 (poAstV1-5),  rotavirus A and C (RVA-RVC), caliciviruses (CaVs), porcine kobuvirus (PoK), hepatitis E virus (HEV), and torque teno sus virus 1 and k2 (TTsuV1-k2). All animals were sampled before 3 weeks of age, and then at 5, 12 and 20 weeks of age. In addition to the 12 targeted viruses, the virome of 12 piglets at 4 different life stages was characterized using a high-throughput sequencing approach. The presence of CaV (sapovirus), poAstV-3 or poAstV-5 was found to be a risk factor for neonatal diarrhea. Co-infections with RVC and poAstV-2, poAstV-3, and poAstV-4 and CaV co-infected with PoK or poAstV-4 were also found to be risk  factors for diarrhea in piglets. RVC, PoK, poAstV-3 and poAstV-4 were the most prevalent viruses in piglets below 3 weeks of age. PoAstV-2, poAstV-4, TTsuV1 and TTsuVk2 were found to be the most prevalent viruses infecting piglets of 20 weeks of age. The enteric virome composition varied between healthy and diarrheic piglets. The alpha and beta diversity of the enteric viromes varied from under 3  weeks of age to 20 weeks and was mainly supported by phages. Overall, this study  sheds new light on enteric virome dynamics and the virome's relationship with neonatal diarrhea.	0
34993422	Innovative strategies for managing swine welfare during the COVID-19 pandemic in  Iowa.	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization and its impact on animal agriculture in the United States was undeniable. By April, COVID-19 resulted in the simultaneous closure or reduced operations of many meat processing plants in the upper Midwest, leading to supply chain disruptions. In Iowa, the leading pork production and processing state, these disruptions caused producer uncertainty, confusion, and stress, including time-sensitive challenges for maintaining animal care. The Iowa Resource Coordination Center (IRCC) was quickly created and launched by the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship (IDALS). The  IRCC included public representation from the Iowa Pork Producers Association (IPPA), Iowa Pork Industry Center (IPIC), and Iowa State University Extension and Outreach, and private partners including producers, veterinarians, and technical  specialists. Supporting swine welfare, the IRCC provided information on management strategies, dietary alterations to slow pig growth, alternative markets, on-farm euthanasia, and mass depopulation under veterinary oversight. In a crisis, Iowa created a model that reacted to producers' pragmatic, mental and emotional needs. This model could be quickly replicated with an introduction of foreign animal disease.	0
34933675	Genetically modified large animal models for investigating neurodegenerative diseases.	Neurodegenerative diseases represent a large group of neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. Although this group of diseases show heterogeneous clinical and pathological phenotypes, they share important pathological features characterized by the age-dependent and progressive degeneration of nerve cells that is caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins. The association of genetic mutations with neurodegeneration diseases has enabled the establishment of various types of animal models that mimic genetic defects and have provided important insights into the pathogenesis. However, most of genetically modified rodent models lack the overt and selective  neurodegeneration seen in the patient brains, making it difficult to use the small animal models to validate the effective treatment on neurodegeneration. Recent studies of pig and monkey models suggest that large animals can more faithfully recapitulate pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss the important differences in animal models for modeling pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases, aiming to assist the use of  animal models to better understand the pathogenesis and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.	0
34949228	Current efforts towards safe and effective live attenuated vaccines against African swine fever: challenges and prospects.	BACKGROUND: African swine fever (ASF) is a fatal hemorrhagic disease in domestic  pigs and wild boar caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV). Since ASF has been introduced into Europe and Asia, the major pig-raising areas, posing a huge threat to the pork industry worldwide. Currently, prevention and control of ASF are basically dependent on strict biosecurity measures and stamping-out policy once ASF occurs. MAIN TEXT: The major risks of ASF spread are insufficient biosecurity measures and human behaviors. Therefore, a safe and effective vaccine seems to be a reasonable demand for the prevention and control of ASF. Due to the efficacy advantage over other types of vaccines, live attenuated vaccines (LAVs), especially virulence-associated genes deleted vaccines, are likely to be put into emergency and conditional use in restricted areas if ASF is out of control in a country with a huge pig population and pork consumption, like China. However, the safety, efficacy, and genetic stability of current candidate ASF LAVs require comprehensive clinical evaluations prior to country-wide field application. Several critical issues need to be addressed to commercialize an ideal ASF LAV, including a stable cell line for manufacturing vaccines, differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA), and cross-protection from different genotypes. CONCLUSION: A safe and effective DIVA vaccine and an accompanying diagnostic assay will facilitate the prevention, control, and eradication of ASF, which is quite challenging in the near future.	0
35401688	Population Genetic Structure and Selection Signature Analysis of Beijing Black Pig.	Beijing Black pig is an excellent cultivated black pig breed in China, with desirable body shape, tender meat quality and robust disease resistance. To explore the level of admixture and selection signatures of Beijing Black pigs, a  total number of 90 individuals covering nine pig breeds were used in our study, including Beijing Black pig, Large White, Landrace, Duroc, Lantang pig, Luchuan pig, Mashen pig, Huainan pig and Min pig. These animals were resequenced with 18.19 folds mapped read depth on average. Generally, we found that Beijing Black  pig was genetically closer to commercial pig breeds by population genetic structure and genetic diversity analysis, and was also affected by Chinese domestic breeds Huainan pig and Min pig. These results are consistent with the cross-breeding history of Beijing Black pig. Selection signal detections were performed on three pig breeds, Beijing Black pig, Duroc and Large White, using three complementary methods (FST, θπ, and XP-EHH). In total, 1,167 significant selected regions and 392 candidate genes were identified. Functional annotations  were enriched to pathways related to immune processes and meat and lipid metabolism. Finally, potential candidate genes, influencing meat quality (GPHA2,  EHD1, HNF1A, C12orf43, GLTP, TRPV4, MVK, and MMAB), reproduction (PPP2R5B and MAP9), and disease resistance (OASL, ANKRD13A, and GIT2), were further detected by gene annotation analysis. Our results advanced the understanding of the genetic mechanism behind artificial selection of Beijing Black pigs, and provided theoretical basis for the subsequent breeding and genetic research of this breed.	0
35281072	Methylome and Transcriptome-Based Integration Analysis Identified Molecular Signatures Associated With Meningitis Induced by Glaesserella parasuis.	Glaesserella parasuis (G. parasuis) can elicit serious inflammatory responses and cause meningitis in piglets. Previous epigenetic studies have indicated that alterations in host DNA methylation may modify the inflammatory response to bacterial infection. However, to date, genome-wide analysis of the DNA methylome  during meningitis caused by G. parasuis infection is still lacking. In this study, we employed an unbiased approach using deep sequencing to profile the DNA  methylome and transcriptome from G. parasuis infected porcine brain (cerebrum) and integrated the data to identify key differential methylation regions/sites involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response. Results showed that DNA  methylation patterns and gene expression profiles from porcine brain were changed after G. parasuis infection. The majority of the altered DNA methylation regions  were found in the intergenic regions and introns and not associated with CpG islands, with only a low percentage occurring at promoter or exon regions. Integrated analysis of the DNA methylome and transcriptome identified a number of inversely and positively correlated genes between DNA methylation and gene expression, following the criteria of |log2FC| > 0.5, |diffMethy| > 0.1, and P <  0.05. Differential expression and methylation of two significant genes, semaphoring 4D (SEMA4D) and von Willebrand factor A domain containing 1 (VWA1), were validated by qRT-PCR and bisulfite sequencing. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses demonstrated that DNA methylation inversely correlated genes in G. parasuis infected porcine brains were mainly involved with cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, RIG-1-like receptor signaling pathways, and hematopoietic cell  lineage signaling pathways. In addition, a protein-protein interaction network of differentially methylated genes found potential candidate molecular interactions  relevant to the pathology of G. parasuis infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate the DNA methylome and transcriptome data from G. parasuis infected porcine brains. Our findings will help understanding the contribution of genome-wide DNA methylation to the pathogenesis of meningitis in pigs and developing epigenetic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the treatment of G. parasuis induced meningitis.	0
35366906	A review of progress and an advanced method for shock advice algorithms in automated external defibrillators.	Shock advice algorithm plays a vital role in the detection of sudden cardiac arrests on electrocardiogram signals and hence, brings about survival improvement by delivering prompt defibrillation. The last decade has witnessed a surge of research efforts in racing for efficient shock advice algorithms, in this context. On one hand, it has been reported that the classification performance of traditional threshold-based methods has not complied with the American Heart Association recommendations. On the other hand, the rise of machine learning and  deep learning-based counterparts is paving the new ways for the development of intelligent shock advice algorithms. In this paper, we firstly provide a comprehensive survey on the development of shock advice algorithms for rhythm analysis in automated external defibrillators. Shock advice algorithms are categorized into three groups based on the classification methods in which the detection performance is significantly improved by the use of machine learning and/or deep learning techniques instead of threshold-based approaches. Indeed, in threshold-based shock advice algorithms, a parameter is calculated as a threshold to distinguish shockable rhythms from non-shockable ones. In contrast, machine learning-based methods combine multiple parameters of conventional threshold-based approaches as a set of features to recognize sudden cardiac arrest. Noticeably, those features are possibly extracted from stand-alone ECGs,  alternative signals using various decomposition techniques, or fully augmented ECG segments. Moreover, these signals can be also used directly as the input channels of deep learning-based shock advice algorithm designs. Then, we propose  an advanced shock advice algorithm using a support vector machine classifier and  a feature set extracted from a fully augmented ECG segment with its shockable and non-shockable signals. The relatively high detection performance of the proposed  shock advice algorithm implies a potential application for the automated external defibrillator in the practical clinic environment. Finally, we outline several interesting yet challenging research problems for further investigation.	0
34941836	Infrared Thermography Evaluation of Feet Temperature and Its Association with Claw Lengths and Anisodactylia in Purebred Sows of Three Greek Herds.	The aim of the study was to investigate the associations of lower feet temperature with claw lengths measurements in purebred sows. In total 22, 19 and  45 multiparous sows in three herds A, B and C of PIC, DANBRED and TOPIGS genetic  lines respectively participated in the study. Mean parity was 2.5, 2.3 and 3.0 for sows from herds A, B and C respectively. Measurements were made during the periparturient period. Infrared temperature distribution was measured in carpus/tarsus, upper-lower metacarpi/metatarsi and phalanges (IRT1, IRT2, IRT3 and IRT4 respectively). In addition, dorsal, diagonal, heel-sole and dew claw lengths of medial and lateral claw were measured and the difference in dorsal claw length between medial and lateral claw (anisodactylia) was calculated in all four feet. Differences between herds regarding IRT and claw length measurements were analyzed with one-way ANOVA with herds as a fixed factor. Correlations between IRT and claw length measurements in each foot including data from all herds were evaluated using the Pearson's correlation test. Maximum IRT1 to 4 in almost all rear feet, differed significantly between herds, being lower in sows of herd C than A and B (p < 0.05). Claw lengths of all feet were lower in herd C  than those of A and B (p < 0.05). Anisodactylia, differed significantly only in rear feet between herds been higher in herd A than C and B (p < 0.05). In all sows, claw lengths and rear feet anisodactylia were positively correlated with maximum IRT1 to IRT4 (p < 0.05). According to the results, IRT temperature distribution of lower feet of purebred sows of different genetic lines were positive correlated with claw lengths measurements and anisodactylia. Collectively, measuring IRT temperature of lower feet of sows with mobile IRT device could be used as an additional tool towards monitoring feet and claw health.	0
35265090	Transcriptome Profiling of Porcine Naïve, Intermediate and Terminally Differentiated CD8+ T Cells.	The pig has the potential to become a leading research model for human diseases,  pharmacological and transplantation studies. Since there are many similarities between humans and pigs, especially concerning anatomy, physiology and metabolism, there is necessity for a better understanding of the porcine immune system. In adaptive immunity, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are essential for host defense. However, most data on CTLs come from studies in mice, non-human primates and humans, while detailed information about porcine CD8+ CTLs is still  sparse. Aim of this study was to analyze transcriptomes of three subsets of porcine CD8β+ T-cell subsets by using next-generation sequencing technology. Specifically, we described transcriptional profiles of subsets defined by their CD11a/CD27 expression pattern, postulated as naïve (CD8β+CD27+CD11alow), intermediate differentiated (CD8β+CD27dimCD11a+), and terminally differentiated cells (CD8β+CD27-CD11ahigh). Cells were analyzed in ex vivo condition as well as  upon in vitro stimulation with concanavalin A (ConA) and PMA/ionomycin. Our analyses show that the highest number of differentially expressed genes was identified between naïve and terminally differentiated CD8+ T-cell subsets, underlining their difference in gene expression signature and respective differentiation stages. Moreover, genes related to early (IL7-R, CCR7, SELL, TCF7, LEF1, BACH2, SATB1, ZEB1 and BCL2) and late (KLRG1, TBX21, PRDM1, CX3CR1, ZEB2, ZNF683, BATF, EZH2 and ID2) stages of CD8+ T-cell differentiation were highly expressed in the naïve and terminally differentiated CD8+ T-cell subsets,  respectively. Intermediate differentiated CD8+ T-cell subsets shared a more comparable gene expression profile associated with later stages of T-cell differentiation. Genes associated with cytolytic activity (GNLY, PRF1, GZMB, FASL, IFNG and TNF) were highly expressed in terminally and intermediate differentiated CD8+ T-cell subsets, while naïve CD8+ T cells lacked expression even after in vitro stimulation. Overall, PMA/ionomycin stimulation induced much  stronger upregulation of genes compared to stimulation with ConA. Taken together, we provided comprehensive results showing transcriptional profiles of three differentiation stages of porcine CD8+ T-cell subsets. In addition, our study provides a powerful toolbox for the identification of candidate markers to characterize porcine immune cell subsets in more detail.	0
34929285	The construction of a haplotype reference panel using extremely low coverage whole genome sequences and its application in genome-wide association studies and genomic prediction in Duroc pigs.	Extremely low coverage whole genome sequencing (lcWGS) is an economical technique to obtain high-density single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Here, we explored  the feasibility of constructing a haplotype reference panel (lcHRP) using lcWGS and evaluated the effects of lcHRP through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and genomic prediction in pigs. A total of 297 and 974 Duroc pigs were genotyped  using lcWGS and a 50 K SNP array, respectively. We obtained 19,306,498 SNPs using lcWGS with an accuracy of 0.984. With the help of lcHRP, the accuracy of imputation from the SNP array to lcWGS was 0.922. Compared to the SNP array findings, those from the imputation-based GWAS identified more signals across four traits. With the integration of the top 1% imputation-based GWAS findings as genomic features, the accuracies of genomic prediction was improved by 6.0% to 13.2%. This study showed the great potential of lcWGS in pigs' molecular breeding.	0
35454283	Genome-Wide Selection Sweep between Wild and Local Pigs from Europe for the Investigation of the Hereditary Characteristics of Domestication in Sus Scrofa.	The phenotypic characteristics of existing domestic pigs (DPs) greatly differ from those of wild boar (WB) populations thousands of years ago. After thousands  of years of human domestication, WB and DP have diverged greatly in terms of genetics. Theoretically, worldwide local pigs have independent contributions from their local WBs at the beginning of Sus scrofa domestication. The investigation of the vicissitude of the heredity material between domestic populations and their wild ancestors will help in further understanding the domestication history of domestic animals. In the present study, we performed a genome-wide association scan (GWSA) and phylogeny estimation with a total of 1098 public European Illumina 60K single nucleotide polymorphism data, which included 650 local DPs and 448 WBs. The results revealed that the phylogenetic relationship of WBs corresponds to their geographical distribution and carries large divergence with  DPs, and all WB breeds (e.g., HRWB, SBWB, and TIWB) presents a closely linkage with the middle WB (e.g., HRWB, and PLWB). In addition, 64 selected candidate genes (e.g., IDH2, PIP5K1B, SMARCA2, KIF5C, and TJP2) were identified from GWSA.  A total of 63 known multiple biological functional pathways were annotated by 22  genes, and ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis pathways that belong to the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins were significantly enriched (p &lt; 0.05). The most frequent (28.57%) pathways were classified under metabolism. We confirmed that the middle European WB has made an important genetic contribution to the entire European WB populations. A series of selected genes discovered from this study provides the scientific community with a deeper understanding of the heredity performance of metabolism and emotion and the real  purpose behind domestication.	0
34899750	A Co-Association Network Analysis Reveals Putative Regulators for Health-Related  Traits in Pigs.	In recent years, the increase in awareness of antimicrobial resistance together with the societal demand of healthier meat products have driven attention to health-related traits in livestock production. Previous studies have reported medium to high heritabilities for these traits and described genomic regions associated with them. Despite its genetic component, health- and immunity-related traits are complex and its study by association analysis with genomic markers may be missing some information. To analyse multiple phenotypes and gene-by-gene interactions, systems biology approaches, such as the association weight matrix (AWM), allows combining genome wide association study results with network inference algorithms. The present study aimed to identify gene networks, key regulators and candidate genes associated to immunocompetence in pigs by integrating multiple health-related traits, enriched for innate immune phenotypes, using the AWM approach. The co-association network analysis unveiled  a network comprised of 3,636 nodes (genes) and 451,407 edges (interactions), including a total of 246 regulators. From these, five genes (ARNT2, BRMS1L, MED12L, SUPT3H and TRIM25) were selected as key regulators as they were associated with the maximum number of genes with the minimum overlapping (1,827 genes in total). The five regulators were involved in pathways related to immunity such as lymphocyte differentiation and activation, platelet activation and degranulation, megakaryocyte differentiation, FcγR-mediated phagocytosis and  response to nitric oxide, among others, but also in immunometabolism. Furthermore, we identified genes co-associated with the key regulators previously reported as candidate genes (e.g., ANGPT1, CD4, CD36, DOCK1, PDE4B, PRKCE, PTPRC  and SH2B3) for immunity traits in humans and pigs, but also new candidate ones (e.g., ACSL3, CXADR, HBB, MMP12, PTPN6, WLS) that were not previously described.  The co-association analysis revealed new regulators associated with health-related traits in pigs. This approach also identified gene-by-gene interactions and candidate genes involved in pathways related to cell fate and metabolic and immune functions. Our results shed new light in the regulatory mechanisms involved in pig immunity and reinforce the use of the pig as biomedical model.	0
35454216	Retrotransposon Insertion Polymorphisms (RIPs) in Pig Coat Color Candidate Genes.	The diversity of livestock coat color results from human positive selection and represents an indispensable part of breed identity. As an important biodiversity  resource, pigs have many special characteristics, including the most visualized feature, coat color, and excellent adaptation, and the coat color represents an important phenotypic characteristic of the pig breed. Exploring the genetic mechanisms of phenotypic characteristics and the melanocortin system is of considerable interest in domestic animals because their energy metabolism and pigmentation have been under strong selection. In this study, 20 genes related to coat color in mammals were selected, and the structural variations (SVs) in these genic regions were identified by sequence alignment across 17 assembled pig genomes, from representing different types of pigs (miniature, lean, and fat type). A total of 167 large structural variations (&gt;50 bp) of coat-color genes, which overlap with retrotransposon insertions (&gt;50 bp), were obtained and designated as putative RIPs. Finally, 42 RIPs were confirmed by PCR detection. Additionally, eleven RIP sites were further evaluated for their genotypic distributions by PCR in more individuals of eleven domesticated breeds  representing different coat color groups. Differential distributions of these RIPs were observed across populations, and some RIPs may be associated with breed differences.	0
35053107	Association of IFNA16 and TNFRSF19 Polymorphisms with Intramuscular Fat Content and Fatty Acid Composition in Pigs.	Interferon-alpha-16 (IFNA16) and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 19 (TNFRSF19) are cytokines that may play a role in adipogenesis and fatness. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the porcine IFNA16 and TNFRSF19 genes were verified and their association with intramuscular fat (IMF) content and fatty acid (FA) composition were evaluated in commercial crossbred pigs. Two non-synonymous SNPs of the porcine IFNA16 c.413G > A and TNFRSF19 c.860G > C loci were detected in commercial crossbred pigs. The porcine IFNA16 c.413G >A polymorphism was significantly associated with stearic acid, total saturated FAs (SFAs), and the ratio of monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs) to SFAs (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the porcine TNFRSF19 c.860G > C polymorphism was found to be  significantly associated with IMF content and arachidic acid levels (p < 0.05). The results revealed that porcine IFNA16 and TNFRSF19 polymorphisms are related to IMF content and/or FA composition and affirmed the importance of these cytokine genes as potential candidate genes for lipid deposition and FA composition in the muscle tissue of pigs.	0
35022729	Correlations of gestational hemoglobin level, placental trace elements content, and reproductive performances in pregnant sows.	The iron status of sows has a great influence on reproductive performance. Iron deficiency reduces reproductive performance and newborn piglet survival rate of sow. The hemoglobin is a potential predictor for the iron status of sows and is convenient for rapid detection in pig farms. However, the relationship between iron status, hemoglobin, placental trace elements, and reproductive performance remains unclear. In this study, the hemoglobin and reproductive performance of more than 500 sows with first to sixth parities at different gestation stages (25, 55, 75, 95, and 110 d of gestation) in two large-scale sow farms were collected, and the content of placental Fe, Zn, Mn, and Cu was analyzed. The results show that hemoglobin levels of sows during pregnancy (days 75, 95, and 110) decreased significantly (P < 0.001). As the parity increases, the hemoglobin levels of sows at days 25 and 55 of gestation and placental mineral element contents including Fe, Zn, Mn, and Cu at delivery decreased (P < 0.05), while the litter size, birth alive, and litter weights increased gradually (P < 0.001). Furthermore, hemoglobin during pregnancy had a negative linear correlation with litter weight and average weight (P < 0.05), and higher hemoglobin at day 25 of gestation may reduce the number of stillbirths (P = 0.05), but higher hemoglobin  at day 110 of gestation may tend to be a benefit for the birth (P = 0.01). And there was a significant positive linear correlation between hemoglobin at day 110 of gestation and placental Fe and Mn levels (P = 0.002, P = 0.013). There was also a significant positive linear correlation among Fe, Zn, Mn, and Cu in the placenta (P < 0.001). The levels of Fe, Zn, and Mn in the placental at delivery were positively related to the average weight of the fetus (P = 0.048, P = 0.027, P = 0.047), and placental Cu was linearly correlated with litter size (P = 0.029). Our research revealed that the requirements for iron during gestation were varied in different gestation periods and parities. The feeds should be adjusted according to the gestation periods, parities, or iron status to meet the iron requirements of sows and fetal pigs.	0
35230646	Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: Also a Disease of the Brain? A Systematic Review of the Preclinical Evidence.	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) currently affects 25% of the global adult population. Cognitive impairment is a recently recognised comorbidity impeding memory, attention, and concentration, affecting the patients' activities of daily living and reducing their quality of life. This systematic review provides an overview of the evidence for, and potential pathophysiological mechanisms behind brain dysfunction at a neurobiological level, in preclinical NAFLD. We performed a systematic literature search for animal models of NAFLD studying intracerebral conditions using PubMed, Embase and Scopus. We included studies that reported data on neurobiology in rodent and pig models with evidence of steatosis or steatohepatitis assessed by liver histology. 534 unique studies were identified, and 30 studies met the selection criteria, and were included. Findings of neurobiological changes were divided into five key areas: (1) neuroinflammation, (2) neurodegeneration, (3) neurotransmitter alterations, (4) oxidative stress, and (5) changes in proteins and synaptic density. Despite significant heterogeneity in the study designs, all but one study of preclinical  NAFLD reported changes in one or more of the above key areas when compared to control animals. In conclusion, this systematic review supports an association between all stages of NAFLD (from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)) and neurobiological changes in preclinical models.	0
35056451	Capture and Ex-Situ Analysis of Environmental Biofilms in Livestock Buildings.	Little information about biofilm microbial communities on the surface of livestock buildings is available yet. While these spatially organized communities proliferate in close contact with animals and can harbor undesirable microorganisms, no standardized methods have been described to sample them non-destructively. We propose a reproducible coupon-based capture method associated with a set of complementary ex-situ analysis tools to describe the major features of those communities. To demonstrate the biofilm dynamics in a pig farm building, we analyzed the coupons on polymeric and metallic materials, as representative of these environments, over 4 weeks. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) revealed a rapid coverage of the coupons with a thick layer of  biological material and the existence of dispersed clusters of active metabolic microorganisms. After detaching the cells from the coupons, counts to quantify the CFU/cm2 were done with high reproducibility. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA V3-V4 region shows bacterial diversity profiles in accordance with reported bacteria diversity in pig intestinal ecosystems and reveals differences  between materials. The coupon-based methodology allows us to deepen our knowledge on biofilm structure and composition on the surface of a pig farm and opens the door for application in different types of livestock buildings.	0
35385164	Hydrogel cultures reveal Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 4 regulation of myofibroblast activation and proliferation in valvular interstitial cells.	As aortic valve stenosis develops, valve tissue becomes stiffer. In response to this change in environmental mechanical stiffness, valvular interstitial cells (VICs) activate into myofibroblasts. We aimed to investigate the role of mechanosensitive calcium channel Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid type 4 (TRPV4) in stiffness induced myofibroblast activation. We verified TRPV4 functionality in VICs using live calcium imaging during application of small molecule modulators of TRPV4 activity. We designed hydrogel biomaterials that mimic mechanical features of healthy or diseased valve tissue microenvironments,  respectively, to investigate the role of TRPV4 in myofibroblast activation and proliferation. Our results show that TRPV4 regulates VIC proliferation in a microenvironment stiffness-independent manner. While there was a trend toward inhibiting myofibroblast activation on soft microenvironments during TRPV4 inhibition, we observed near complete deactivation of myofibroblasts on stiff microenvironments. We further identified Yes-activated protein (YAP) as a downstream target for TRPV4 activity on stiff microenvironments. Mechanosensitive TRPV4 channels regulate VIC myofibroblast activation, whereas proliferation regulation is independent of the microenvironmental stiffness. Collectively, the  data suggests differential regulation of stiffness-induced proliferation and myofibroblast activation. Our data further suggest a regulatory role for TRPV4 regarding YAP nuclear localization. TRPV4 is an important regulator for VIC myofibroblast activation, which is linked to the initiation of valve fibrosis. Although more validation studies are necessary, we suggest TRPV4 as a promising pharmaceutical target to slow aortic valve stenosis progression.	0
35182673	Characterization, mRNA expression profile, subcellular distribution and association analysis with piglet diarrhea of porcine matrix metallopeptidase 7 (pMMP7).	Matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) is involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix in disease processes and therefore plays an important role in host disease resistance/susceptibility. To better understanding the effects of porcine MMP7 (pMMP7) on piglets diarrhea trait, we characterized pMMP7 gene, identified genetic variations in pMMP7 and explored the relationship between pMMP7 polymorphisms and piglets diarrhea in Min pig and Landrace populations. The complete coding sequence of pMMP7 is 804 bp encoding a protein of 267 amino acids. Sequence alignment showed that the identity between pMMP7 and human MMP7 was approximately 80%. The expression of pMMP7 in the gut of healthy piglets were weak and the distribution of the pMMP7-EGFP fusion protein was observed mainly in the cytoplasm. After the identification of 21 genetic variations in 5' flanking region and exons, Hae III and Eco72 Ⅰ PCR-RFLP were established to genotype SNP rs327380117 and rs329429922, respectively. Statistical analysis indicated that Landrace piglets with a TT genotype at rs327380117 had a lower diarrhea score and day-14 wt than TC piglets (p < 0.05); the diarrhea score of AA Landrace animals with rs329429922 was lower than that of GG individuals (p < 0.05). The findings presented here contribute to the understanding of the biological function of pMMP7 and may provide new molecular markers for pig breeding.	0
34917905	Adenoviral VEGF-B186R127S gene transfer induces angiogenesis and improves perfusion in ischemic heart.	Vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B) is an interesting therapeutic candidate for coronary artery disease. However, it can also cause ventricular arrhythmias, potentially preventing its use in clinics. We cloned VEGF-B isoforms with different receptor binding profiles to clarify the roles of VEGFR-1 and Nrp-1 in angiogenesis and to see if angiogenic properties can be maintained while avoiding side effects. VEGF-B constructs were studied in vivo using adenovirus (Ad)-mediated intramyocardial gene transfers into the normoxic and ischemic porcine heart (n = 51). It was found that the unprocessed isoform VEGF-B186R127S  is as efficient angiogenic growth factor as the native VEGF-B186 in normoxic and  ischemic heart. In addition, AdVEGF-B186R127S increased myocardial perfusion reserve by 22% in ischemic heart without any side effects. AdVEGF-B127 (VEGFR-1 and Nrp-1 ligand) and AdVEGF-B109 (VEGFR-1 ligand) did not induce angiogenesis. Thus, VEGF-B186 is angiogenic only before its proteolytic processing to VEGF-B127. Only the VEGF-B186 C-terminal fragment was associated with arrhythmias.	0
35234615	Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus virulent or avirulent strain-infected porcine small intestinal epithelial cells.	Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the main cause of diarrhea, vomiting, and mortality in pigs, which results in devastating economic loss to the pig industry around the globe. In recent years, the advent of RNA-sequencing technologies has led to delineate host responses at late stages of PEDV infection; however, the comparative analysis of host responses to early-stage infection of virulent and avirulent PEDV strains is currently unknown. Here, using the BGI DNBSEQ RNA-sequencing, we performed global gene expression profiles of pig intestinal epithelial cells infected with virulent (GDS01) or avirulent (HX) PEDV strains for 3, 6, and 12 ​h. It was observed that over half of all significantly dysregulated genes in both infection groups exhibited a down-regulated expression pattern. Functional enrichment analyses indicated that  the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the GDS01 group were predominantly related to autophagy and apoptosis, whereas the genes showing the differential expression in the HX group were strongly enriched in immune responses/inflammation. Among the DEGs, the functional association of TLR3 and IFIT2 genes with the HX and GDS01 strains replication was experimentally validated by TLR3 inhibition and IFIT2 overexpression systems in cultured cells.  TLR3 expression was found to inhibit HX strain, but not GDS01 strain, replication by enhancing the IFIT2 expression in infected cells. In conclusion, our study highlights similarities and differences in gene expression patterns and cellular  processes/pathways altered at the early-stage infection of PEDV virulent and avirulent strains. These findings may provide a foundation for establishing novel therapies to control PEDV infection.	0
35388401	Cytomegalovirus Infection Associated with Smaller Total Cortical Surface Area in  Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders.	OBJECTIVES: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) congenital infection and in immunodeficiency can have deleterious effects on human cortex. In immunocompetent adults, the putative association between CMV infection and cortical measures has not been explored. We hypothesized that CMV exposure is associated with smaller cortical surface area or cortical thinning mainly in patients with schizophrenia spectrum  disorders. STUDY DESIGN: We included 67 adult patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and 262 adult healthy controls. We measured circulating CMV IgG antibody concentrations with solid-phase immunoassay techniques. We measured the total cortical surface area, regional cortical surface areas and the overall mean cortical thickness based on T1-weighted MRI scans processed in FreeSurfer v6.0. STUDY RESULTS: In the whole sample analysis, we found a significant diagnostic group-by-CMV status interaction on the total surface area (P = .020). Among patients, CMV antibody positivity was significantly associated with smaller total surface area (P = .002, partial eta2 = 0.138) whereas no such association was found in healthy controls (P = .059). Post hoc analysis among patients showed that higher CMV antibody concentrations were also significantly associated with smaller total surface area (P = .038), and that CMV antibody positivity was significantly inversely associated with 14 left and 16 right regional surface areas mainly in the frontal and temporal lobes. CMV infection was not associated  with the overall mean cortical thickness. CONCLUSIONS: The results are indicative of a cortical surface area vulnerability  to CMV infection in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders but not in healthy controls. CMV infection may contribute to the established cortical surface area aberrations in schizophrenia.	0
35378328	Meta-analysis of MspI derived variants of growth hormone gene associated with milk yield in dairy cattle.	OBJECTIVE: The present work aimed to obtain common effect sizes for the gene frequency and association of MspI derived variants of growth hormone (GH) gene with milk yield in dairy cows. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of 35 published studies identified in literature search from 2000 to 2020 (n = 4164). These studies were specific to fragment size (329) for genotypes viz., CC (224, 105 bp), CD (329, 224, 105 bp) and DD (329 bp). Pooled standard mean differences  (SMDs) as effect sizes between allele pairs were derived using different genetic  models. The heterogeneity between effects sizes across studies was estimated using I2 Index (%). RESULTS: The common effect size for gene frequency of allele C (224, 105 bp) was  significantly (P < 0.05) higher in 2881 Bos taurus/cross cows (0.82; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.89; I2 = 97.81%) than 1283 Bos indicus cows (0.15; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.18; I2 = 71.90%), with overall gene frequency was 0.33 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.46; I2 = 99.29%). Additive (CC vs. DD) and dominant (CC + CD vs. DD) did not revealed significant (P > 0.05) association with milk yield. However, completely over dominant (CC + DD vs. CD) and recessive (CC vs. CD + DD) models showed significant (P < 0.05) and positive SMDs with milk yield specially at early lactations. There was no evidence of heterogeneity (I2 = 0.00%) between SMDs across studies. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggested potential association of C allele for enhancing milk production of dairy cows.	0
35238185	Population genomics reveals that natural variation in PRDM16 contributes to cold  tolerance in domestic cattle.	Environmental temperature serves as a major driver of adaptive changes in wild organisms. To discover the mechanisms underpinning cold tolerance in domestic animals, we sequenced the genomes of 28 cattle from warm and cold areas across China. By characterizing the population structure and demographic history, we identified two genetic clusters, i.e., northern and southern groups, as well as a common historic population peak at 30 kilo years ago. Genomic scan of cold-tolerant breeds determined potential candidate genes in the thermogenesis-related pathways that were under selection. Specifically, functional analysis identified a substitution of PRDM16 (p.P779L) in northern cattle, which maintains brown adipocyte formation by boosting thermogenesis-related gene expression, indicating a vital role of this gene in cold tolerance. These findings provide a basis for genetic variation in domestic  cattle shaped by environmental temperature and highlight the role of reverse mutation in livestock species.	0
35203833	Antibiotic Use in Alpine Dairy Farms and Its Relation to Biosecurity and Animal Welfare.	The quantification of antimicrobial usage (AMU) in food-producing animals can help identify AMU risk factors, thereby enhancing appropriate stewardship policies and strategies for a more rational use. AMU in a sample of 34 farms in the Province of Trento (north-eastern Italy) from 2018 to 2020 was expressed as defined daily doses for animals per population correction unit according to European Surveillance of Veterinary Antimicrobial Consumption guidelines (DDDvet) and according to Italian guidelines (DDDAit). A retrospective analysis was carried out to test the effects of several husbandry practices on AMU. Overall, the average AMU ranged between 6.5 DDDAit in 2018 and 5.2 DDDAit in 2020 (corresponding to 9 and 7 DDDvet, respectively), showing a significant trend of decrement (-21.3%). Usage of the highest priority critically important antimicrobials (HPCIA) was reduced by 83% from 2018 to 2020. Quarantine management, available space, water supply, animals' cleanliness and somatic cell  count had no significant association with AMU. Rather, farms with straw-bedded cubicles had lower AMU levels than those with mattresses and concrete floors (p < 0.05). In conclusion, this study evidenced a decrement in AMU, particularly regarding HPCIA, but only a few risk factors due to farm management.	0
35232965	Integrative analyses of genomic and metabolomic data reveal genetic mechanisms associated with carcass merit traits in beef cattle.	Improvement of carcass merit traits is a priority for the beef industry. Discovering DNA variants and genes associated with variation in these traits and  understanding biological functions/processes underlying their associations are of paramount importance for more effective genetic improvement of carcass merit traits in beef cattle. This study integrates 10,488,742 imputed whole genome DNA  variants, 31 plasma metabolites, and animal phenotypes to identify genes and biological functions/processes that are associated with carcass merit traits including hot carcass weight (HCW), rib eye area (REA), average backfat thickness (AFAT), lean meat yield (LMY), and carcass marbling score (CMAR) in a population  of 493 crossbred beef cattle. Regression analyses were performed to identify plasma metabolites associated with the carcass merit traits, and the results showed that 4 (3-hydroxybutyric acid, acetic acid, citric acid, and choline), 6 (creatinine, L-glutamine, succinic acid, pyruvic acid, L-lactic acid, and 3-hydroxybutyric acid), 4 (fumaric acid, methanol, D-glucose, and glycerol), 2 (L-lactic acid and creatinine), and 5 (succinic acid, fumaric acid, lysine, glycine, and choline) plasma metabolites were significantly associated with HCW,  REA, AFAT, LMY, and CMAR (P-value < 0.1), respectively. Combining the results of  metabolome-genome wide association studies using the 10,488,742 imputed SNPs, 103, 160, 83, 43, and 109 candidate genes were identified as significantly associated with HCW, REA, AFAT, LMY, and CMAR (P-value < 1 × 10-5), respectively. By applying functional enrichment analyses for candidate genes of each trait, 26, 24, 26, 24, and 28 significant cellular and molecular functions were predicted for HCW, REA, AFAT, LMY, and CMAR, respectively. Among the five topmost significantly enriched biological functions for carcass merit traits, molecular transport and small molecule biochemistry were two top biological functions associated with all carcass merit traits. Lipid metabolism was the most significant biological function for LMY and CMAR and it was also the second and fourth highest biological function for REA and HCW, respectively. Candidate genes and enriched biological functions identified by the integrative analyses of metabolites with phenotypic traits and DNA variants could help interpret the results of previous genome-wide association studies for carcass merit traits. Our integrative study also revealed additional potential novel genes associated with  these economically important traits. Therefore, our study improves understanding  of the molecular and biological functions/processes that influence carcass merit  traits, which could help develop strategies to enhance genomic prediction of carcass merit traits with incorporation of metabolomic data. Similarly, this information could guide management practices, such as nutritional interventions,  with the purpose of boosting specific carcass merit traits.	0
35320949	Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone Inhibits Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 Expression and  Tyrosyl Phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes by Increasing NF-κB DNA-Binding Activity.	Background: Abundant evidence indicates that thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are associated with insulin resistance in adipocytes. However, the potential mechanism of the association remains uncertain. The objective of this study was to determine the potential role of TSH in the suppression of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) expression and IRS-1 tyrosyl phosphorylation, which  might contribute to insulin resistance. Methods: Mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated into adipocytes. After treatment with 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mIU/ml bovine TSH, the TNF-α concentration in the medium was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) DNA-binding activity was quantified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). IRS-1 levels in adipocytes were quantified by Western blotting, and tyrosine phosphorylation was measured by immunoprecipitation. Results: TSH induced TNF-α secretion in a dose-dependent manner. There was a significant positive correlation between NF-κB DNA-binding activity and TNF-α secretion. This effect and correlation were weakened by BAY 11-7082 (a nuclear NF-κB inhibitor) and H89 (an inhibitor of cyclic adenosine monophosphate- (cAMP-) dependent protein kinase A (PKA)). Treatment of cultured adipocytes with TSH inhibited insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosyl phosphorylation but promoted TSH-dependent secretion of TNF-α and activation of NF-κB DNA-binding activity. The effects of TSH were significantly inhibited by BAY 11-7082 and H89 and were completely blocked by the TNF-α antagonist WP9QY. Conclusion: TSH inhibited IRS-1 protein expression and tyrosyl phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by stimulating TNF-α production via promotion of NF-κB DNA-binding activity. TSH might play a pivotal role in the development of insulin resistance.	0
35327070	Calving Ease Risk Factors and Subsequent Survival, Fertility and Milk Production  in Italian Holstein Cows.	The objectives of this study were to investigate the main risk factors associated with calving ease (CE) in Italian Holstein cow herds, and to estimate the association between CE and subsequent survival, fertility and milk production. Data obtained from Holstein cows in 40 Italian herds were retrospectively investigated. Calvings were surveilled and classified into two categories of CE,  unassisted calving or assisted calving, based on the need for intervention. The following factors were analyzed as possible risk factor affecting CE: herd, number of calvings/herd/year, age at first calving (AFC), cow parity, gestation length, twinning, calf sex, previous calving-to-conception interval, previous milk yield, dry period and close-up length, and season of calving. The association between CE and culling risk within the first 30 days-in-milk (DIM), cumulative 60-d milk yield and predicted 305-d milk yield, and pregnancy risk within 150 DIM were also investigated. Of the 47,672 calvings, 37,892 (79.5%) were unassisted, while 9780 (20.5%) required some type of assistance. Among the risk factors, only the AFC was not correlated with CE, while for all the other risk factors an association with CE was detected. Assisted calvings were associated with an increased culling risk at 30 DIM, decreased 60-d milk yield, decreased 305-d milk yield and reduced pregnancy risk at 150 DIM. In conclusion,  dairy herd management should aim at correcting/reducing the risk factors in order to limit the incidence of assisted calving, and possibly improve the quality of calving assistance; controlling CE within the herd is crucial to reducing culling risk, and achieving higher lactation and reproductive performance.	0
35451786	Genomic Prediction of Complex Traits in Animal Breeding with Long Breeding History, the Dairy Cattle Case.	"In accordance with the infinitesimal model for quantitative traits, a very large  number of genes affect nearly all economic traits. In only two cases has the causative polymorphism been determined for genes affecting economic traits in dairy cattle. Most current methods for genomic evaluation are based on the ""two-step"" method. Genetic evaluations are computed by the individual animal model, and functions of the evaluations of progeny-tested sires are the dependent variable for estimation of marker effects. With the adoption of genomic evaluation in 2008, annual rates of genetic gain in the US increased from ∼50-100% for yield traits and from threefold to fourfold for lowly heritable traits, including female fertility, herd-life and somatic cell concentration. Gradual elimination of the progeny test scheme has led to a reduction in the number of sires with daughter records and less genetic ties between years. As genotyping costs decrease, the number of cows genotyped will continue to increase, and these records will become the basic data used to compute genomic evaluations, most likely via application of ""single-step"" methodologies. Less emphasis in selection goals will be placed on milk production traits, and more on health, reproduction, and efficiency traits and ""environmentally friendly"" production. Genetic variance for economic traits is maintained by increase in frequency of rare alleles, new mutations, and changes in selection goals and management."	0
35330865	Biomarkers common for inflammatory periodontal disease and depression: A systematic review.	Background: Dysregulated immune response arising in the periphery can induce depressive symptoms through neuroimmune interactions. Inflammatory oral pathology can be a potent inducer of chronic neuroimmune response relevant to depression. We aimed to synthesize available evidence for the association between inflammatory periodontal diseases (IPD) and major depression (MD) in relation to  a broad range of biomarkers. Methods: Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Scopus databases were searched from inception until January 27, 2022. Search terms included subject headings and synonyms for inflammatory periodontal disease and depression. Studies that reported data on both depression and inflammatory periodontal disease as categories along with measurement of a biomarker were considered. Two reviewers independently selected the articles for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the quality of each study. The protocol for this study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021215524. Results: Twenty-eight studies were included in the final review-eleven cross-sectional studies, seven case-control studies, and six prospective cohort studies conducted in humans; the remaining four were experimental animal studies. Eighteen studies including all animal studies reported a positive association between depression and periodontal disease; one study reported a negative association and another nine studies found no such associations. Twenty studies reported mixed associations between IPD and biomarkers (i.e, salivary, serum, urine or gingival crevicular fluid cortisol, C reactive protein, cytokines, etc.). Biomarkers related to depression were gingival crevicular fluid cortisol,  interleukin 6 (IL-6), Il-1β, immunoglobulin G against Bacterioides forsythus; root canal lipopolysaccharides; blood IL-6, IL-1β, cortisol, advanced oxidation protein products, nitric oxide metabolites, lipid hydroperoxides and trapping antioxidant parameter; whereas five studies found no associations between depression and a biomarker. Although animal studies showed interaction of immune, inflammatory and neurotrophic biomarkers in the relationship between depression and periodontal disease, human studies showed mixed findings. In most studies, there were risks of bias due to the sample selection and assessment protocol. Study heterogeneity and limited number of comparable studies reporting on shared  biomarkers precluded a meta-analysis. Conclusion: Immune-inflammatory contribution to depression was evident in the context of inflammatory periodontal diseases, but whether biomarkers mediate the  associations between IPD and MD needs to be tested through methodologically rigorous studies aiming specifically at this hypothesis.	0
35391795	Whole-Genome Analyses Reveal Genomic Characteristics and Selection Signatures of  Lincang Humped Cattle at the China-Myanmar Border.	The location on the Yunnan border with Myanmar and its unique cultural landscape  has shaped Lincang humped cattle over time. In the current study, we investigated the genetic characteristics of 22 Lincang humped cattle using whole-genome resequencing data. We found that Lincang humped cattle derived from both Indian indicine and Chinese indicine cattle depicted higher levels of genomic diversity. Based on genome-wide scans, candidate genomic regions were identified that were potentially involved in local thermal and humid environmental adaptions, including genes associated with the body size (TCF12, SENP2, KIF1C, and PFN1), immunity (LIPH, IRAK3, GZMM, and ELANE), and heat tolerance (MED16, DNAJC8, HSPA4, FILIP1L, HELB, BCL2L1, and TPX2). Missense mutations were detected in candidate genes IRAK3, HSPA4, and HELB. Interestingly, eight missense mutations observed in the HELB gene were specific to the indicine cattle pedigree. These mutations may reveal differences between indicine and taurine cattle adapted to variable climatic conditions. Our research provides new insights into the genetic characteristics of Lincang humped cattle representing Lincang and Pu'er areas as  an important channel for the migration of Indian indicine from domestication centers toward southwestern China.	0
35392214	The extended farm effect: The milk protein β-lactoglobulin in stable dust protects against allergies.	BACKGROUND: The allergy- and asthma-protective farm effect is mediated by numerous factors. Especially dust from cattle stables and raw cow's milk show beneficial properties, suggesting a bovine protein to be involved. As a major milk protein and member of the lipocalin family, β-lactoglobulin (BLG) binds small, hydrophobic ligands and thereby modulates the immune response. Empty BLG promotes allergy development, whereas BLG in association with ligands shows allergy-preventive as well as allergy-reducing effects in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: BLG has been identified as a major protein in stable dust (therein bound to zinc) as well as in the air around cattle stables. This association with zinc  favors an allergy-protective immune profile. CONCLUSION: Its immune-modulating, allergy-protective characteristics together with its presence in raw cow's milk as well as in stable dust and ambient air render BLG an essential contributor to the farm effect.	0
35296234	Screening for phenotypic outliers identifies an unusually low concentration of a  β-lactoglobulin B protein isoform in bovine milk caused by a synonymous SNP.	BACKGROUND: Milk samples from 10,641 dairy cattle were screened by a mass spectrometry method for extreme concentrations of the A or B isoforms of the whey protein, β-lactoglobulin (BLG), to identify causative genetic variation driving changes in BLG concentration. RESULTS: A cohort of cows, from a single sire family, was identified that produced milk containing a low concentration of the BLG B protein isoform. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of BLG B protein isoform concentration in milk from AB heterozygous cows, detected a group of highly significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within or close to the BLG gene. Among these was  a synonymous G/A variation at position + 78 bp in exon 1 of the BLG gene (chr11:103256256G > A). The effect of the A allele of this SNP (which we named B') on BLG expression was evaluated in a luciferase reporter assay in transfected CHO-K1 and MCF-7 cells. In both cell types, the presence of the B' allele in a plasmid containing the bovine BLG gene from -922 to + 898 bp (relative to the transcription initiation site) resulted in a 60% relative reduction in mRNA expression, compared to the plasmid containing the wild-type B sequence allele. Examination of a mammary RNAseq dataset (n = 391) identified 14 heterozygous carriers of the B' allele which were homozygous for the BLG B protein isoform (BB'). The level of expression of the BLG B' allele was 41.9 ± 1.0% of that of the wild-type BLG B allele. Milk samples from three cows, homozygous for the A allele at chr11:103,256,256 (B'B'), were analysed (HPLC) and showed BLG concentrations of 1.04, 1.26 and 1.83 g/L relative to a mean of 4.84 g/L in milk  from 16 herd contemporaries of mixed (A and B) BLG genotypes. The mechanism by which B' downregulates milk BLG concentration remains to be determined. CONCLUSIONS: High-throughput screening and identification of outliers, enabled the discovery of a synonymous G > A mutation in exon 1 of the B allele of the BLG gene (B'), which reduced the milk concentration of β-lactoglobulin B protein isoform, by more than 50%. Milk from cows carrying the B' allele is expected to have improved processing characteristics, particularly for cheese-making.	0
35203201	Evaluation of the Thuringian Bovine Johne's Disease Control Program-A Case Study.	The Thuringian Johne's Disease (JD) Control Program provides a voluntary approach to JD control in Thuringia, a federal state of Germany. The program has three objectives: reduce the level of infection when present; reduce the spread of JD to uninfected herds; and facilitate the certification and protection of herds that are non-suspect with respect to JD. The program offers pathways for the management of affected herds and for certification of herds with continuing negative tests. After the control stage (CS), a certification stage of at least 3 consecutive years with continuing negative results in the annual whole-herd test  has to be passed until a herd can be certified as 'non-suspect' with respect to JD. This study focused on calf mortality in relation to JD herd status. In a longitudinal study, the association of annual calf mortality rate of a total of 93 dairy herds (13 'non-suspect'; 26 in control stage; 54 not enrolled) over 10 consecutive years with JD herd status was investigated using a generalized mixed  linear model with repeated measures. Non-suspect herds had a lower calf mortality rate compared with other farms. We conclude that establishing JD control measures lowers the calf mortality rate.	0
35233959	Copy number variation of the CCDC39 gene is associated with growth traits in Chinese cattle.	BACKGROUND: Copy number variation (CNV) has become an essential part of genetic structural variation. Coiled-coil domain containing 39 (CCDC39) is a gene that related to the growth and development of organs and tissues. It is identified that it has a CNV region by animal genome resequencing. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we detected the phenotypic traits and different distributions of CCDC39 gene copy numbers in five Chinese cattle breeds (Qinchuan (QC) cattle, Yunling (YL) cattle, Xianan (XN) cattle, Pinan (PN) cattle and Jiaxian (JX) cattle). METHODS: Five hundred and six cattle were randomly selected for CNV distribution  detection. Blood samples were taken and genomic DNA was extracted. Different tissues were obtained from adult (n = 3) XN cattle, including heart, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle and lung. The genome qPCR experiment was performed with SYBR Green in triplicate. CDNA qPCR was used to detect the expression level of CCDC39 in different tissues and varieties. Using SPSS v20.0 software, the relationship between CCDC39 CNV and the growth traits of PN, XN, QC, NY and YL cattle breeds was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: The results showed that the expression of CCDC39 in lung was higher than that in other tissues. The expression in liver and kidney was similar, but the expression in heart and muscle was less. It can be seen that the duplication type of QC cattle CCDC39 CNV is higher than the deletion or normal in the height at hip cross. The normal type of PN cattle in body length and hip width was better than duplication and deletion (p < 0.05). In XN cattle, the deletion type of CNV  had superior growth characteristics in heart girth and cannon bone circumference  compared with the duplication type and the normal type (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The study revealed a significant association between CNV of CCDC39 gene and growth traits in different Chinese cattle breeds.	0
35415213	The relationships between κ-casein (CSN3) gene polymorphism and some performance  traits in Simmental cattle.	In this study we aim to examine genotypic structures in terms of the κ -casein (CSN3) gene locus in 70 head of Simmental cattle raised in a private enterprise in Erzurum to determine the distribution of genotypes and allele frequencies in cattle in terms of related genes and to correlate the determined genotypes with some performance characteristics. CSN3/HinfI gene polymorphisms were identified in DNA isolated from blood samples taken from Simmental cattle used in the study  using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. The frequency of the AA, AB, and BB genotype of the CSN3 gene  in the population was 57.14 %, 32.86 %, and 10.00 %, respectively; the frequency  of the A allele was 0.74; and the frequency of the B allele was 0.26. The mean value for the AA, AB, and BB genotypes was 5151  ±  308.6, 5805  ±  370.3, and 5772  ±  547.3 kg for real milk yield, respectively; 5313  ±  233.9, 5784  ±  280.7, and 6458  ±  414.8 kg in 305 d for milk yield; 17.9  ±  0.75, 18.6  ±  0.89, and 19.6  ±  1.32 kg for daily milk yield; and 294  ±  13.7, 316  ±  16.5, and 294  ±  24.4 d during the lactation period. The distribution of the CSN3 gene locus in the studied population is in genetic equilibrium according to the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The genotype and allele frequencies determined in terms of CSN3 gene polymorphism can be considered sufficient to reveal the genotype diversity of the breed, and it was determined that the relationship of CSN3 genotypes was only significant with 305 d milk yield ( P < 0.05 ) in terms of the association between CSN3 genotypes and some performance traits. It has been concluded that animals with the CSN3 BB genotype have an economic advantage within the herd and that CSN3 can be used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in  this regard.	0
35256125	Description of bovine babesiosis and anaplasmosis outbreaks in northern Uruguay between 2016 and 2018.	Bovine babesiosis and anaplasmosis cause important economic losses in livestock production. In Uruguay, the main aetiological agents of bovine babesiosis and anaplasmosis are Babesia bovis, B. bigemina and Anaplasma marginale. The aim of this work was to describe the outbreaks of bovine babesiosis and anaplasmosis in  northern Uruguay between 2016 and 2018. Convenience sampling was carried out. We  worked with blood and organ samples from bovines with clinical signs and autopsy  findings compatible with babesiosis and anaplasmosis. A total of 140 presumptive  outbreaks were studied. Epidemiological information such as place, date of occurrence, age, number of sick and dead animals, clinical signs, autopsy findings, the presence of ticks and health management that involved injectables were registered. The diagnoses were carried out by blood and organ smears stained with Giemsa and confirmed by multiplex PCR. There were 83 (59.2%) positive outbreaks, comprising 35 (42.2%) A. marginale, 19 (22.9%) B. bigemina, 18 (21.7%) B. bovis and 11 (13.2%) mixed infections (Babesia spp. + A. marginale). Cows were the most commonly affected category. The clinical signs and autopsy findings with a significant association (p ≤ 0.05) were anaemia, pale mucous membranes, fever,  jaundice, ataxia and aggressiveness, splenomegaly, and orange discolouration of the liver. Babesiosis had a seasonal occurrence, mainly in autumn, while anaplasmosis cases were recorded throughout the year. The use of injectable agents was associated with A. marginale transmission. This work contributes updated information about epidemiological and clinical patterns of bovine babesiosis and anaplasmosis in northern Uruguay, which is important for implementing preventive measures and control.	0
35233794	A de novo variant in the bovine ADAMTSL4 gene in an Original Braunvieh calf with  congenital cataract.	Inherited forms of cataract are a heterogeneous group of eye disorders known in livestock species. Clinicopathological analysis of a single case of impaired vision in a newborn Original Braunvieh calf revealed nuclear cataract. Whole-genome sequencing of the parent-offspring trio revealed a de novo mutation  of ADAMTSL4 in this case. The heterozygous p.Arg776His missense variant affects a conserved residue of the ADAMTSL4 gene that encodes a secreted glycoprotein expressed in the lens throughout embryonic development. In humans, ADAMTSL4 genetic variants cause recessively inherited forms of subluxation of the lens. Given that ADAMTSL4 is a functional candidate gene for inherited disorders of the lens, we suggest that heterozygosity for the identified missense variant may have caused the congenital cataract in the affected calf. Cattle populations should be monitored for unexplained cataract cases, with subsequent DNA sequencing a hypothesized pathogenic effect of heterozygous ADAMTSL4 variants could be confirmed.	0
35325183	Pleomorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1) promotes proliferation and inhibits apoptosis  of bovine primary myoblasts through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.	Pleomorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1) is a transcription factor involved in various  cellular processes in organismal growth and development. However, its role in muscle function is unclear. This work investigated the roles of PLAG1 in muscle development and explored its regulatory mechanisms. The PLAG1 was proved to promote the proliferation of bovine primary myoblasts using the cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) assay (P < 0.001), 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) proliferation assay  (P = 0.005), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) (P = 0.028), western blot, and flow cytometry (P < 0.05), and to inhibit apoptosis of  bovine primary myoblasts using qRT-PCR (P = 0.038), western blot, and flow cytometry (P < 0.001). Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and western blot showed PLAG1 upregulated phosphorylated (p)-PI3K, PI3K, p-Akt, Akt,  Cyclin D1, and CDK2 and inhibited the expression of p21 and p27 to enhance myoblast proliferation, and increased expression of Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL to inhibit  apoptosis. Additionally, PLAG1 was identified as a target of miR-1 using dual-luciferase assay (P < 0.001), qRT-PCR (P < 0.001), and western blot. Furthermore, miR-1 might be a potential mediator of the positive feedback regulation relationship between PLAG1 and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.	0
35405828	One Health and Cattle Genetic Resources: Mining More than 500 Cattle Genomes to Identify Variants in Candidate Genes Potentially Affecting Coronavirus Infections.	Epidemiological and biological characteristics of coronaviruses and their ability to cross species barriers are a matter of increasing concerns for these zoonotic  agents. To prevent their spread, One Health approaches should be designed to include the host (animal) genome variability as a potential risk factor that might confer genetic resistance or susceptibility to coronavirus infections. At present, there is no example that considers cattle genetic resources for this purpose. In this study, we investigated the variability of six genes (ACE2, ANPEP, CEACAM1 and DPP4 encoding for host receptors of coronaviruses; FURIN and TMPRSS2 encoding for host proteases involved in coronavirus infection) by mining  whole genome sequencing datasets from more than 500 cattle of 34 Bos taurus breeds and three related species. We identified a total of 180 protein variants (44 already known from the ARS-UCD1.2 reference genome). Some of them determine altered protein functions or the virus-host interaction and the related virus entry processes. The results obtained in this study constitute a first step towards the definition of a One Health strategy that includes cattle genetic resources as reservoirs of host gene variability useful to design conservation and selection programs to increase resistance to coronavirus diseases.	0
35430623	Babesiosis in cattle and ixodid tick distribution in Dasenech and Salamago Districts, southern Ethiopia.	Babesiosis, caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Babesia, and ixodid ticks  are considered to be one of the most important causes that result in significant  economic losses in cattle production worldwide, including in Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was undertaken in the Dasenech and Salamago Districts of South Omo zone Ethiopia to determine the prevalence and associated risk factors of babesia infection and ixodid ticks of cattle using Giemsa-stained thin and thick film techniques and morphological identification keys for babesia species and tick identification, respectively. Out of 470 examined cattle, 102 (21.7%) were infected by Babesiosis (15.53% Babesia bigemina and 6.17% Babesia bovis). A  statistically significant association (p < 0.05) was observed between babesia infection and season and tick infestation. However, cattle that were infected with the Babesia parasite revealed a lower mean PCV value (21.49%) than noninfected cattle (28.29%) and showed a statistically significant (p < 0.05) difference with the occurrence of Babesia infection. The overall prevalence of ixodid ticks was 53.8% (253/470) and revealed a statistically significant association (p < 0.05) between the season and origin of the animal. However, no statistically significant association (p > 0.05) was observed between sex, age, and body condition score of the animal with the occurrence of ixodid tick. A total of 8040 adult ticks belonging to four tick genera, Amblyomma, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus), Hyalomma, and Rhipicephalus, were collected from various body parts  and identified. The high prevalence of Babesia infection and ixodid ticks in cattle at the study sites requires seroprevalence and molecular studies to identify the predominant Babesia species and to detect Babesia in tick hemolymph  for the identification of tick genera responsible for the occurrence of Babesia infection. Additionally, tailoring suitable and coordinated tick management methods using chemotherapy as well as strategic treatment to overt clinical cases of bovine babesiosis is critical.	0
35431553	Environmental and Behavioral Factors Associated With Handwashing With Soap After  Defecation in a Rural Setting of 2 Districts of the Jimma Zone, Ethiopia.	Background: Handwashing with soap can prevent the spread of fecal oral microbes in the home environment. Despite the lack of water and for a variety of reasons,  soap-based handwashing is not practiced in developing countries after defecation. Objective: The objective of the study was to determine the environmental and behavioral factors associated with hand washing with soap after defecation of respondents with children under the age of 5 years in a rural setting. Methods: Data used were taken from 756 households with children under the age of  5 that participated in a cross-sectional study conducted from July 22 to August 9, 2018, in 2 selected districts in the Jimma Zone, Southwest Ethiopia. It included post-defecation hand washing with soap and other variables such as sociodemographic information, environmental and behavioral factors. Stata version 16 was used to analyze the data. We use binary logistic regression models. To declare statistical significance, a P-value of less than .05 with an adjusted odds ratio and a confidence interval of 95% was used. Results: The prevalence of soap-based post defecation hand washing practices among respondents was 64.4%. Hand washing practice after defecation with soap has a significant association with having more than 1 child under 5 years of age (AOR = 1.60; 95% CI: 1.05-2.45), households living with cattle (AOR = 2.00; 95% CI: 1.30-3.07), use of unimproved latrine (AOR = 0.55; 95%CI: 0.31-0.98), with the presence of feces in the compound of the households interviewed (AOR = 7.08;  95% CI: 4.07-12.35) and regular cleaning water containers before filling drinking water (AOR = 2.16; 95% CI: 1.13-4.15). Conclusions: Most of the study participants washed their hands with soap after defecation. The presence of feces in the compound, having more than 1 child, living with cattle, and cleaning water containers routinely before filling drinking water all enhanced post-defecation handwashing with soap. However, when  using unimproved latrines, respondents' post-defecation handwashing behavior with soap may be significantly reduced.	0
35231232	Parameters to identify good quality oocytes and embryos in cattle.	Oocyte/embryo selection methodologies are either invasive or noninvasive and can  be applied at various stages of development from the oocyte to cleaved embryos and up to the blastocyst stage. Morphology and the proportion of embryos developing to the blastocyst stage are important criteria to assess developmental competence. Evaluation of morphology remains the method of choice for selecting viable oocytes for IVP or embryos prior to transfer. Although non-invasive approaches are improving, invasive ones have been extremely helpful in finding candidate genes to determine oocyte/embryo quality. There is still a strong need  for further refinement of existing oocyte and embryo selection methods and quality parameters. The development of novel, robust and non-invasive procedures  will ensure that only embryos with the highest developmental potential are chosen for transfer. In the present review, various methods for assessing the quality of oocytes and preimplantation embryos, particularly in cattle, are considered. These methods include assessment of morphology including different staining procedures, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, metabolic profiling, as well as the use of artificial intelligence technologies.	0
35431534	Delayed adverse reaction to a natural dermal filler mimicking salivary gland neoplasia.	Background: Cosmetic dermal fillers are a sought-after procedure globally. However, despite the safety claims of filler materials by the manufacturers, adverse reactions still occur. Case presentation: This case report is of a 66-year-old female who presented with a late-onset complication of a hyaluronic acid dermal filler that clinically mimicked a salivary gland neoplasm. The patient presented with firm peri-oral swellings of short duration that clinically mimicked a pleomorphic adenoma and mucoepidermoid carcinoma. The diagnosis was that of a foreign-body granulomatous  response to dermal fillers. Although other mimics of a similar nature are reported a knowledgeable clinician, careful choice of filler material, knowledge  of the product, thorough pre-procedural history taking and post-procedural patient follow-up can drastically minimize a possible misdiagnosis. The reaction  was treated with a combination of hyaluronidase, betamethasone and 5-flurouracil  intra-lesional injections monthly for 11 consecutive months, with total clinical  resolution. Conclusions: Patient education of the procedure, product name and the possibility of an adverse reaction occurring, even years later or at a site distant to the initial site of placement, is vital. Further, we review the recent reported adverse association of the new mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and dermal filler placement.	0
35441227	Association of cow's milk intake in early childhood with adiposity and cardiometabolic risk in early adolescence.	BACKGROUND: Prior studies have provided conflicting evidence regarding associations of pediatric milk consumption with subsequent adiposity. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to estimate associations of the frequency and fat content of  early childhood milk intake with early adolescent adiposity and cardiometabolic risk. METHODS: : We analyzed data collected prospectively from 796 children in Project  Viva, a Boston-area pre-birth cohort. Parents reported the frequency (times/day)  and fat content (higher-fat: whole (3.25%) or 2%; lower-fat: 1% or skim) of cow's milk consumed in early childhood (mean 3.2 years) via food-frequency questionnaires. We measured adiposity and cardiometabolic markers in early adolescence (mean 13.2 years) and conducted multivariable regression to assess associations adjusted for baseline parental and child sociodemographic, anthropometric, and dietary factors. RESULTS: In early childhood, mean milk intake was 2.3 times/day (standard deviation [SD] 1.2), and 63% of children drank primarily higher-fat milk. Early childhood BMI z-score (BMIz) was inversely associated with the fat content of milk consumed in early childhood. After adjustment for baseline parent and child  factors, early childhood intake of higher-fat compared with lower-fat milk was associated with lower adiposity; however, the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for most adiposity outcomes-except for odds of overweight/obesity (OR 0.60; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.93)-crossed the null after adjustment for baseline child BMIz and BMIz change between ages 2 and 3 years. Early childhood consumption of higher-fat milk (vs. lower-fat milk) was not associated with adverse cardiometabolic outcomes. The frequency of cow's milk consumed in early childhood was not associated with adiposity or cardiometabolic risk in early adolescence. CONCLUSION: Consumption of higher-fat cow's milk in early childhood was not associated with increased adiposity or adverse cardiometabolic health over a decade later. Our findings do not support current recommendations to consume lower-fat milk to reduce the risk of later obesity and adverse cardiometabolic outcomes.

35205299	Genomic Diversity Profiling and Breed-Specific Evolutionary Signatures of Selection in Arunachali Yak.	Arunachali yak, the only registered yak breed of India, is crucial for the economic sustainability of pastoralist Monpa community. This study intended to determine the genomic diversity and to identify signatures of selection in the breed. Previously available double digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing data of Arunachali yak animals was processed and 99,919 SNPs were considered for further analysis. The genomic diversity profiled based on nucleotide diversity, π (π = 0.041 in 200 bp windows), effective population size, Ne (Ne = 83) and Runs of homozygosity (ROH) (predominance of shorter length ROHs) was found to be optimum. Subsequently, 207 regions were identified to be under selective sweeps through de-correlated composite of multiple signals (DCMS) statistic which combined three individual test statistics viz. π, Tajima's D and  |iHS| in non-overlapping 100 kb windows. Mapping of these regions revealed 611 protein-coding genes including KIT, KITLG, CDH12, FGG, FGA, FGB, PDGFRA, PEAR1, STXBP3, olfactory receptor genes (OR5K3, OR5H6 and OR1E1) and taste receptor genes (TAS2R1, TAS2R3 and TAS2R4). Functional annotation highlighted that biological processes like platelet aggregation and sensory perception were the most overrepresented and the associated regions could be considered as breed-specific signatures of selection in Arunachali yak. These findings point towards evolutionary role of natural selection in environmental adaptation of Arunachali yak population and provide useful insights for pursuing genome-wide association studies in future.	0
35342679	The copy number variation of DMBT1 gene effects body traits in two Chinese cattle breeds.	Copy number variations (CNVs) belong to mutations in the genome level with loci in the region of genic or intergenic. It is through different effects (such as position effect and dose effect) that influence complex traits and diseases. Deleted in Malignant Brain Tumors 1 (DMBT1) gene is a member of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich super family. In cattle, this gene has been associated with the susceptibility to bovine tuberculosis. In this study, a new CNV was found in DMBT1 gene of Chinese cattle breeds and tested in two different Chinese  cattle breeds (Jiaxian red and Pinan) for frequency distribution analysis. Besides, the body size data such as body length, body height, chest girth, chest  width, rump length, and rump girth for Jiaxian (JX) and Pinan (PN) cattle were collected and associated with the newly identified CNV. The CNV was significantly associated with the body length and chest girth of JX cattle, and the rump length of PN cattle (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the expression profile of the DMBT1 gene was tested in calves' tissues and the myoblasts differentiation. It was found that the DMBT1 gene expression was high in tuberculosis susceptible tissues (liver and lungs) at the calf stage and high in myoblast early differentiation. These tests were done using the qPCR method. As the result, the CNV of DMBT1 gene could be used as a candidate marker for bovine growth and health in marker-assisted selection (MAS) breeding.	0
35263339	Estradiol-induced immune suppression via prostaglandin E2 during parturition in bovine leukemia virus-infected cattle.	Immune suppression during pregnancy and parturition is considered a risk factor that is related to the progression of bovine chronic diseases, such as bovine leukosis, which is caused by bovine leukemia virus (BLV). Our previous studies have demonstrated that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) suppresses BLV-specific Th1 responses and contributes to the disease progression during BLV infection. Although PGE2 reportedly plays important roles in the induction of parturition, PGE2 involvement in immune suppression during parturition is unknown. To investigate its involvement, we analyzed PGE2 kinetics and Th1 responses in BLV-infected pregnant cattle. PGE2 concentrations in sera were increased, whereas IFN-γ responses were decreased before delivery. PGE2 is known to suppress Th1 immune responses in cattle. Thus, these data suggest that PGE2 upregulation inhibits Th1 responses during parturition. We also found that estradiol was important for PGE2 induction in pregnant cattle. In vitro analyses indicated that estradiol suppressed IFN-γ production, at least in part, via PGE2/EP4 signaling.  In vivo analyses showed that estradiol administration significantly influenced the induction of PGE2 production and impaired Th1 responses. Our data suggest that estradiol-induced PGE2 is involved in the suppression of Th1 responses during pregnancy and parturition in cattle, which could contribute to the progression of BLV infection.	0
35297729	Effect of LHCGR and FSHR gene polymorphisms on fertility traits and milk yield of cross-bred dairy cows in Sri Lanka.	"Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of fertility genes will be useful in improving the genetic potential of dairy cows. A population of 142 cross-bred  dairy cows was screened for SNPs in bovine luteinizing hormone choriogonadotropin receptor (LHCGR) and bovine follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) genes. The effect of reported SNPs on selected fertility traits (average calving interval, average number of services per conception and age at first calving) and milk yield was determined. Altogether six SNPs were detected in animals screened  under the present study. Among them, four SNPs (rs41256848, rs41256850, rs465790244, and rs45463781) were located in the exon 11 region of the LHCGR gene and two SNPs (rs43676359 and G-278-A (GU253337) were located in the five upstream region of the FSHR gene. Minor alleles identified for SNPs in the FSHR gene in the studied small population of cows differed from those reported in other research. In this study, only rs45463781 SNP at exon 11 of the LHCGR gene significantly affected the average milk yield in cross-bred cows. The nucleotide  change from ""G"" to ""A"" negatively affected the average milk yield. Further investigations are needed to confirm the reported association with a larger sample size."	0
35309117	Transcriptome Analysis of Bovine Rumen Tissue in Three Developmental Stages.	Rumen development is a crucial physiological challenge for ruminants. However, the molecular mechanism regulating rumen development has not been clearly elucidated. In this study, we investigated genes involved in rumen development in 13 rumen tissues from three developmental stages (birth, youth, and adult) using  RNA sequencing. We identified that 6,048 genes were differentially expressed among three developmental stages. Using weighted correlation network analysis, we found that 12 modules were significantly associated with developmental stages. Functional annotation and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis revealed that CCNB1, CCNB2, IGF1, IGF2, HMGCL, BDH1, ACAT1, HMGCS2, and CREBBP involved in rumen development. Integrated transcriptome with GWAS information of  carcass weight (CW), stomach weight (SW), marbling score (MS), backfat thickness  (BFT), ribeye area (REA), and lean meat weight (LMW), we found that upregulated DEGs (fold change 0∼1) in birth-youth comparison were significantly enriched with GWAS signals of MS, downregulated DEGs (fold change >3) were significantly enriched with GWAS signals of SW, and fold change 0∼1 up/downregulated DEGs in birth-adult comparison were significantly enriched with GWAS signals of CW, LMW,  REA, and BFT. Furthermore, we found that GWAS signals for CW, LMW, and REA were enriched in turquoise module, and GWAS signals for CW was enriched in lightgreen  module. Our study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanism underlying rumen development in cattle and highlights an integrative analysis for illustrating the genetic architecture of beef complex traits.	0
35439682	Seasonal semen quality of a local and commercial taurine cattle breeds, raised in a subtropical climate: Relationship between external morphology of the animals and climate.	Livestock production is considered an important factor influencing global warming; however, climate change has also been considered one of the major factors affecting livestock production and reproduction. The present study was carried out in the Southern region of Brazil and aimed to assess the seasonal influence of climatic factors and external morphology of the animals on the semen quality. Three ejaculates were obtained from each bull (Crioulo Lageano and Angus) in summer and winter seasons. Motile cells, sperm vigor, sperm concentration, sperm membrane status, and sperm abnormalities were analyzed in fresh and post-thawed semen. In addition, the sperm kinetics using CASA was assessed on post-thawed semen. Environmental data such as air temperature (AT), relative humidity (RH), mean radiant temperature (MRT) and temperature-humidity index (THI) were measured. Furthermore, body and testicular metrics, as well as hair coat characteristics, were recorded in each season on all bulls. Environmental traits differed significantly between seasons. Results of the PLS regression and Spearman's correlations confirmed a negative relationship between  climatic variables and sperm traits in both seasons. Semen quality between breeds and seasons was similar, satisfactory, and heat stress was not sufficient to impair spermatozoa viability. External morphological traits were considered non-important in the final model. The findings of this study suggest that AT, MRT, and THI were the most important factors that could affect seminal characteristics of bulls raised in a subtropical climate.	0
35453091	Risk factors associated with the welfare of grazing dairy cows in spring-calving, hybrid pasture-based systems.	Large-scale investigation of risk factors for multiple welfare indicators in hybrid pasture-based dairy systems is scarce. Our objective was to identify grazing season welfare risk factors on spring-calving, hybrid pasture-based dairy farms where cows experience periods of both grazing and housing. Herd-level data  were collected from visits to 93 farms in the primary dairy producing counties of Ireland. Zero-inflated beta regression analysis was used to assess potential associations between categorical management and resource factors, and commonly measured animal-based welfare indicators: locomotion, body condition, nasal and ocular discharge, tail injury, integument damage, and avoidance behaviour. To account for small sample size due to elimination of farms with missing data, analyses were conducted on both a dataset of complete cases, and a dataset where  missing values had been substituted for the most common response through single imputation. Resulting risk factors from both methods of analysis were compared for each indicator. Analyses identified 14 risk factors associated with one or more welfare indicators. The proportion of lame cows was positively associated with a previous housing period of four months or more compared to three months, all cubicles being outside recommended lengths and repairing roadways every two to three years compared to either yearly or more than every four years to never.  The proportion of cows below minimum target grazing body condition score of 2.75  was negatively associated with participation in elective herd disease-testing in  the past year. The proportion of cows with tail lacerations was positively associated with using a single breeding method, not employing part-time staff and not using brisket boards in cubicles. Previous housing period length was significantly associated with the proportion of cows with integument damage, although the direction of association was unclear. Moderate to severe nasal discharge was positively associated with collecting yard holding times of ≤ 60 min compared to > 90 min. Ocular discharge was negatively associated with manual health record-keeping and a collecting yard below the recommended area of  1.4 m2/cow. The proportion of cows with an avoidance response distance > 1 m was  positively associated with herding cows without a dog present and having no additional full-time staff. Multiple risk factors were related to the housing period, suggesting that potential carry-over effects of housing management on welfare persist into the grazing period. This emphasizes the need for research to consider both housing and grazing periods in the management of welfare in hybrid  pasture-based systems.	0
35346972	Advanced glycation end products correlate with breast cancer metastasis by activating RAGE/TLR4 signaling.	INTRODUCTION: This study was aimed to investigate the mechanisms of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in promoting invasion and metastasis of breast cancer. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with 131 breast cancer were enrolled in a cohort and followed up to investigate the association between AGEs and metastasis. Serum AGE concentrations were detected by ELISA. Breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells were exposed to generated AGE-bovine serum albumin (BSA). CCK-8  assay was used to select the non-cytotoxic concentrations of AGE-BSA. Small interfering RNA was used to knock down Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Migration and invasion were evaluated by wound healing and transwell assays. Real-time PCR and  western blotting were used to detect the gene expressions. RESULTS: In the cohort study, metastasis incidence was significantly correlated with serum AGE concentrations in patients with breast cancer (adjusted OR=1.75, 95% CI=1.20 to 2.57, p=0.004). During follow-up, metastasis interval was significantly shorter in diabetic than non-diabetic subjects. In the in vitro study, AGE-BSA incubation significantly promoted migration and invasion of cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner. AGE-BSA dramatically increased expressions of receptor for AGEs (RAGE), TLR4, myeloid differentiation factor (MyD88), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), promoted nuclear translocation of nuclear factor κB (NFκB) p65, but decreased the expression of inhibitor of NFκB (IκBα). TLR4 silencing significantly suppressed migration and invasion of cancer  cells exposed to AGE-BSA. TLR4 silencing reduced the expression of MyD88 and MMP9, as well as nuclear translocation of NFκB p65 but increased IκBα expression  in AGE-BSA-incubated breast cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: AGEs are correlated with metastasis of breast cancer. AGEs' promoting effects on migration and invasion of breast cancer cells via activating RAGE/TLR4/MyD88 signaling were suggested as the involved mechanism.	0
35369596	Genetic polymorphisms of the 5' untranslated regions of the HSP70 gene in Indonesian cattle populations.	Background and Aim: Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a group of proteins that play  a significant role in protecting cells against cellular stress. HSP70 is a conserved, sensitive, and abundant gene associated with heat stress's physiological adaptability. The objective of this study was to reveal the polymorphisms of the partial sequences of the HSP70 gene (5' untranslated region  [UTR]) in seven cattle populations in Indonesia. Materials and Methods: Polymerase chain reaction products (551 bp) of the HSP70 gene amplified from 102 animals representing seven cattle populations (Bali, Belgian Blue x Peranakan Ongole [PO] cross, Galekan, Jabres, Madura, PO, and Rambon) were sequenced by DNA sequencing method. Results: Fourteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), generally found at a low frequency, were detected. Among these SNPs, only 1117G>A, 1125A>C, and 1204T>C were polymorphic in all the analyzed breeds. A Chi-square test showed that the majority of the loci were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.05). Varying levels of observed (0.050-0.571) and expected heterozygosity (0.049-0.500) were noted. The polymorphism information content values (0.048-0.375) indicated that the SNPs in the HSP70 gene showed low-to-moderate polymorphism in the studied populations. Thirty-six haplotypes were defined according to the identified SNPs, of which haplotype Hap5 (CGACGAGAGTGTCC) and Hap4 (CGACGAGAGTGCCC) were generally dominant in the studied samples. The phylogenetic tree showed a close relationship between Bali and Rambon cattle and  between Galekan and Jabres cattle, while the Belgian Blue x PO crossbred cattle were farther apart. Conclusion: The polymorphisms in the 5' UTR of the HSP70 geneidentified in this study should be further investigated in a larger population to unravel the association between the SNPs and thermotolerance in Indonesian local cattle populations.	0
35448671	Phenotypic and Genotypic Characterization of C. perfringens Isolates from Dairy Cows with a Pathological Puerperium.	Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) forms part of the intestinal microbiome, but is also a known pathogen in histotoxic infections. The significance of the pathogen as a cause of uterine infections in cattle has been little studied so far. Here, we analyzed the association between a pathological puerperium in cattle and the detection of C. perfringens in a prospective longitudinal study. Clostridium perfringens were only found in vaginal and uterine samples of diseased cattle, and were absent in healthy controls. Isolates (n = 21) were tested for the production of major toxins (alpha-, beta-, epsilon-toxin) by ELISA and for the potential of production of major (alpha-, beta-, iota-toxin) and minor toxins (beta2 toxin) by PCR. Furthermore, antimicrobial susceptibility was  also tested phenotypically by microdilution. Despite the frequent use of tetracycline treatment in cows suffering from puerperal disorders, no isolate showed phenotypic tetracycline resistance. Most isolates did not release major amounts of toxin. The strict association of C. perfringens with puerperal disease, together with the absence of major toxins might hint towards a major role of other or unknown clostridial virulence factors in uterine disease.	0
35427993	Assessing the effects of experimental bacterial challenge with Pasteurella multocida and ampicillin on the respiratory microbiota of pre-weaned Holstein calves.	The association between changes in the respiratory microbiota and Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) in dairy calves is not well understood. We investigated characteristics of the nasopharyngeal (NP) microbiota associated with BRD following Pasteurella multocida infection. We also evaluated the effect of ampicillin on the respiratory microbiota. Calves (n = 30) were inoculated with P. multocida and randomly allocated into an antibiotic group (AMP; n = 17) or placebo group (PLAC; n = 11) when lung lesions developed. Deep NP swabs (DNPS) were collected before and after challenge. Monitoring was performed daily until euthanasia at day 14. Swabs and tissue samples were collected for analysis. The V4 hypervariable region of the 16 S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. Increased species abundance in the pre-challenge DNPS was associated with a decrease in cumulative respiratory disease over 14 days post-infection. While NP beta diversity was affected by infection, antibiotic therapy showed no effect on the alpha and beta diversity nor the relative abundance (RA) of genera in the NP tonsil, lymph node and lung microbiota. Antibiotic therapy was associated with an increased RA of NP Pasteurella spp. and a decreased RA of NP Prevotella spp. Common taxa among all samples included GIT-associated bacteria, which suggests a possible link between the GIT microbiota and respiratory microbiota in dairy calves.	0
35286235	LEM domain containing 1 promotes pancreatic cancer growth and metastasis by p53 and mTORC1 signaling pathway.	Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a common type of malignancy originating from the epithelium of the pancreatic duct, with the most lethal feature and worst prognosis. LEM domain containing 1 (LEMD1) is overexpressed in multiple tumor tissues and plays a key role in cancer carcinogenesis and progression. However, little is known about the potential of LEMD1 in PC. In this study, we explored the clinical values, as well as the potential roles and mechanisms of LEMD1 in PC. We, for the first time, showed that LEMD1 was upregulated in PC and negatively correlated with the overall and disease-free survival of patients with PC. Of the function, LEMD1 knockdown inhibited cancer cell growth, migration and  invasion, while LEMD1 overexpression promoted tumor aggressiveness. The tumor-promoting influences of LEMD1 in PC were also proved by in vivo assays. Mechanistically, GSEA identified that LEMD1 promoted PC aggressiveness, as well as affecting cell cycle dysregulation and apoptosis resistance, by p53 suppression and the activation of the mTORC1 signal pathway. In short, LEMD1 could serve as a valuable prognostic candidate and a potential therapeutic target of PC.Abbreviations: ATCC: American Type Culture Collection; CCK-8: Cell counting kit 8; CDK: Cyclin-dependent kinases; CTA: Cancer-testis antigen; DMEM: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium; ECL: enhanced chemiluminescence; FBS: Fetal bovine serum; GEO: Gene Expression Omnibus; LEMD1: LEM domain containing 1; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin; NC: Negative control; PC: Pancreatic cancer; PVDF: Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes; qRT-PCR: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; SDS-PAGE: Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SD: Standard deviation; SKP2: S-Phase kinase-associated protein  2; TAA: Tumor-associated antigen; TBST: Tris-buffered Saline Tween-20; TCGA: The  Cancer Genome Atlas.	0
35352250	Polymorphism rs1046495 of the GFER Gene as a New Genetic Marker of Preposition to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.	The study involving 2830 subjects (1444 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 1386 healthy controls) an association of the rs1046495 polymorphism of the GFER gene encoding FADdependent sulfhydryl oxidase with low risk of the disease in non-obese patients (OR=0.76, 95%CI 0.57-0.99, p=0.029). The protective effect  of the polymorphic gene variant remained significant in individuals who consumed  fresh vegetables and fruits (p=0.014), proteins (p=0.0017), and did not consume carbohydrate- and fat-reach food (p=0.0047). The association of the minor allele  rs1046495-C with type 2 diabetes mellitus can be explained by its more pronounced effect on the expression of the GFER enzyme that through glutathionation maintains the ROS level for optimal functioning of complexes III and IV of the electron transport chain and promotes the formation of disulfide bonds in the CHCHD4 chaperone molecule. Impaired activity of this molecule underlies mitochondrial dysfunction, one of the key pathological changes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.	0
35250142	Analysis of the 2020 Taal Volcano tephra fall deposits from crowdsourced information and field data.	After 43 years of dormancy, Taal Volcano violently erupted in January 2020 forming a towering eruption plume. The fall deposits covered an area of 8605 km2, which includes Metro Manila of the National Capital Region of the Philippines. The tephra fall caused damage to crops, traffic congestion, roof collapse, and changes in air quality in the affected areas. In a tropical region where heavy rains are frequent, immediate collection of data is crucial in order to preserve  the tephra fall deposit record, which is readily washed away by surface water runoff and prevailing winds. Crowdsourcing, field surveys, and laboratory analysis of the tephra fall deposits were conducted to document and characterize  the tephra fall deposits of the 2020 Taal Volcano eruption and their impacts. Results show that the tephra fall deposit thins downwind exponentially with a thickness half distance of about 1.40 km and 9.49 km for the proximal and distal  exponential segments, respectively. The total calculated volume of erupted fallout deposit is 0.057 km3, 0.042 km3, or 0.090 km3 using the exponential, power-law, and Weibull models, respectively, and all translate to a VEI of 3. However, using a probabilistic approach (Weibull method) with 90% confidence interval, the volume estimate is as high as 0.097 km3. With the addition of the base surge deposits amounting to 0.019 km3, the volume translates to a VEI of 4,  consistent with the classification for the observed height and umbrella radius of the 2020 main eruption plume. VEI 4 is also consistent with the calculated median eruption plume height of 17.8 km and sub-plinian classification based on combined analysis of isopleth and isopach data. Phreatomagmatic activity originated from a vent located in Taal Volcano's Main Crater Lake (MCL), which contained 42 million m3 of water. This eruptive style is further supported by the characteristics of the ash grain components of the distal 12 January 2020 tephra fall deposits, consisting dominantly of andesitic vitric fragments (83-90%). Other components of the fall deposits are lithic (7-11%) and crystal (less than 6%) grains. Further textural and geochemical analysis of these tephra fall deposits contributes to better understand the volcanic processes that occurred at Taal Volcano, one of the 16 Decade Volcanoes identified by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior (IAVCEI) because of its destructive nature and proximity to densely populated areas. The crowdsourcing initiative provided a significant portion of the data used for this study while at the same time educating and empowering the community to build resilience.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00445-022-01534-y.	0
35300890	Young Adult Healthcare Exposure and Future Opioid Misuse: A Prospective Cohort Study.	INTRODUCTION: Outpatient opioid prescribing is associated with opioid misuse in young adults, but the longitudinal association between general healthcare exposure and opioid misuse has not been explored. The objective of this study is  to examine the association between healthcare exposure in young adulthood and future opioid misuse. METHODS: Data were drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (2001-2018) and analyzed in 2021. Healthcare exposure (i.e., inpatient hospitalization and visits to the clinic, emergency department, mental-health facility, or dentist) between individuals aged 18 and 26 years was  the primary independent variable; only patients who did not report opioid misuse  at baseline were included. Opioid misuse was defined as using prescription painkillers without a doctor's permission and was measured 17 years after exposure. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine any associations  with opioid misuse (ages 33-43 years). RESULTS: A total of 8,225 young adults with a mean baseline age of 21.8 (SE=0.12) years met inclusion criteria. Approximately 13.7% reported new opioid misuse at follow-up. Those reporting opioid misuse at follow-up were more likely to be White, lack a college education, or report depression. Those exposed to inpatient hospitalization, emergency departments, or mental-health facilities had an increased risk of future opioid misuse. CONCLUSIONS: In young adults reporting no opioid misuse at baseline, healthcare exposure was associated with an increased risk of opioid misuse later in adulthood in this large, national cohort. Physicians encounter this at-risk population daily, reinforcing the importance of responsible prescribing practices and the need for targeted screening, patient education, and intervention efforts  in the healthcare setting.	0
35452796	Macrocyclic lactone resistance in nematodes of cattle in Brazil: Blame it to the  ticks!	Strategic helminth control in adult cattle would hardly impose sufficient selection pressure to parasite populations but reports of resistance against macrocyclic lactone (ML) based-products have been confirmed worldwide. The objective of this study was to evaluate the scientific literature of ML resistance (< 90.0% efficiency) in helminths of cattle from 2001 (the first report) to 2020 in Brazil. Additional to the data, we studied the correlation of  parasite control practices based on a questionnaire given to 32 farmers. The search returned 246 reports and 21 full articles were selected. From these, a Wordcloud and a Keyword Co-occurrence Network graph were created. The published data revealed that most of the studies (19/21) reported multi-species (Cooperia spp., Haemonchus sp., Oesophagostomum radiatum, Trichostrongylus sp.) resistance  to ML. None of the reports described the treatment frequency in the tested farms. As for the questionnaire, the majority of farmers (> 70.0%) responded that they rotate products after treatment, animals are treated monthly or biweekly (58.0%), treatments are based on visual evaluation (coat condition, ectoparasite infestation), and that in 94.0% of the times farmers treat all animals. Moreover, farmers use ML in association with potent acaricides (cypermethrin, chlorpyriphos, fluazuron) in more than 90.0% of the times (15/16). It was observed that this regimen was used to prevent and control the cattle-tick Rhipicephalus microplus (90.0%) and the horn-fly, Haematobia irritans (30.0%) infestations. We conclude that the most important factor for nematode resistance  was the high level of ML exposure of up to 16 times/year, in combination with acaricides to control ticks and to a lesser extent to control horn-flies. Therefore, selection of helminth populations in cattle in Brazil can be considered secondary to ectoparasite control. The present analysis is critical, as one the most widespread recommendations to avoid drug resistance is to reduce  the use of long-acting compounds, due to their extended persistent periods, increasing parasite selection. Moreover, a more serious attitude must be taken regarding parasite control strategies for livestock, reinforcing that health protocols should be based on single acaricidal products whenever possible. Complementary, selective evaluations based on transient threshold population abundance must be enforced to reduce treatment frequency, reducing parasite selection and animal distress.	0
35447479	Expression and single nucleotide polymorphisms of vitamin D receptor gene in cows with puerperal metritis in Egypt.	The aim of this work is to study the expression profile of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), 1-α hydroxylase enzyme, and chemokine regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted genes (RANTES) genes in dairy cows with puerperal metritis, as well as to study the association between polymorphisms in the VDR gene and occurrence of such disease condition, which is considered a key to advances in the preventive medicine for such a problem in the future. Blood samples were collected from 60 dairy cows; from which 48 dairy cows proved to suffer puerperal metritis and other 12 apparently healthy recent parturient dairy cows were selected randomly for assessment the fold change variation in the expression profiles of the studied genes. Depending on the clinical examination,  the normal cut-off point of the serum calcium, phosphorus, glucose, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and chloride, and the normal reference values of parathyroid hormone (PTH), 18 out of 48 dairy cows suffered puerperal metritis with a normal  metabolic profile, which underwent further molecular analysis. In the studied dairy cows that suffered puerperal metritis with a normal metabolic profile, the  expression pattern of the VDR and RANTES genes showed a significant up-regulation (P < 0.05), whereas the expression pattern of 1α-hydroxylase enzyme gene showed a significant down-regulation (P < 0.05) in comparison with those of healthy recent parturient dairy cows. The sequenced regions of the VDR gene (exon 7, partial intron 6, partial intron 7) didn't exhibit polymorphisms in their nucleotide sequence, and consecutively their amino acid sequence when compared to the published sequence on the gene bank. The results propose that the VDR gene (exon  7, partial intron 6, partial intron 7) polymorphisms do not play a role in the pathogenesis of puerperal metritis in dairy cows, excluding a role of the vitamin D in puerperal metritis.	0
35238583	The significance of early temperamental reactivity for children's social competence with peers: A meta-analytic review and comparison with the role of early attachment.	Early temperamental reactivity and attachment security are key predictors of children's social competence with peers. Leveraging meta-analytic evaluation of the significance of early attachment for social competence already available (Groh et al., 2014), this quantitative review examined the significance of early  temperamental reactivity for social competence with peers and compared the strength of this association with that for attachment. Based on 140 independent samples (u = 382; N = 49,891), the meta-analytic association between early difficult temperament and (lower) social competence was significant (r = 0.13, z  = 0.13; 95% CI [0.11, 0.16]), but decreased as time between assessments increased. Findings were similar for negative and positive emotionality. Greater  negative emotionality was associated with lower social competence (r = 0.14, z =  0.14; 95% CI [0.11, 0.17], k = 93, u = 172), and greater positive emotionality was associated with better social competence (r = 0.18, z = 0.18; 95% CI [0.12, 0.24], k = 43, u = 54). Meta-analytic associations were reduced when overlapping  informants and overlapping items in temperament and social competence assessments were excluded (difficult temperament: r = 0.10, z = 0.10; 95% CI [0.06, 0.13]; negative emotionality: r = 0.10, z = 0.10; 95% CI [0.05, 0.15]; positive emotionality: r = 0.10, z = 0.10; 95% CI [0.06, 0.14]). Meta-analytic associations between these broadband temperament dimensions and social competence were smaller than the meta-analytic association between attachment security and social competence. Discussion focuses on the developmental significance of early  temperament for social competence and ways to reconcile literatures on early temperament and attachment in future research on the developmental antecedents of children's social competence.

35294591	Immune epitopes identification and designing of a multi-epitope vaccine against bovine leukemia virus: a molecular dynamics and immune simulation approaches.	BACKGROUND: Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is an oncogenic delta-retrovirus causing  bovine leucosis. Studies on BLV have shown the association with human breast cancer. However, the exact molecular mechanism is neither known nor their appropriate preventative measure to halt the disease initiation and progression.  In this study, we designed a multi-epitope vaccine against BLV using a computational analyses. METHODS: Following a rigorous assessment, the vaccine was constructed using the T-cell epitopes from each BLV-derived protein with suitable adjuvant and linkers. Both physicochemistry and immunogenic potency as well as the safeness of the vaccine candidate were assessed. Population coverage was done to evaluate the vaccine probable efficiency in eliciting the immune response worldwide. After homology modeling, the three-dimensional structure was refined and validated to determine the quality of the designed vaccine. The vaccine protein was then subjected to molecular docking with Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) to evaluate the binding efficiency followed by dynamic simulation for stable interaction. RESULTS: Our vaccine construct has the potential immune response and good physicochemical properties. The vaccine is antigenic and immunogenic, and has no  allergenic or toxic effect on the human body. This novel vaccine contains a significant interactions and binding affinity with the TLR3 receptor. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed vaccine candidate would be structurally stable and capable of generating an effective immune response to combat BLV infections. However, experimental evaluations are essential to validate the exact safety and  immunogenic profiling of this vaccine.	0
35401673	Extensive Variation in Gene Expression is Revealed in 13 Fertility-Related Genes  Using RNA-Seq, ISO-Seq, and CAGE-Seq From Brahman Cattle.	Fertility is a key driver of economic profitability in cattle production. A number of studies have identified genes associated with fertility using genome wide association studies and differential gene expression analysis; however, the  genes themselves are poorly characterized in cattle. Here, we selected 13 genes from the literature which have previously been shown to have strong evidence for  an association with fertility in Brahman cattle (Bos taurus indicus) or closely related breeds. We examine the expression variation of the 13 genes that are associated with cattle fertility using RNA-seq, CAGE-seq, and ISO-seq data from 11 different tissue samples from an adult Brahman cow and a Brahman fetus. Tissues examined include blood, liver, lung, kidney, muscle, spleen, ovary, and uterus from the cow and liver and lung from the fetus. The analysis revealed several novel isoforms, including seven from SERPINA7. The use of three expression characterization methodologies (5' cap selected ISO-seq, CAGE-seq, and RNA-seq) allowed the identification of isoforms that varied in their length of 5' and 3' untranslated regions, variation otherwise undetectable (collapsed as degraded RNA) in generic isoform identification pipelines. The combinations of different sequencing technologies allowed us to overcome the limitations of relatively low sequence depth in the ISO-seq data. The lower sequence depth of the ISO-seq data was also reflected in the lack of observed expression of some genes that were observed in the CAGE-seq and RNA-seq data from the same tissue. We identified allele specific expression that was tissue-specific in AR, IGF1, SOX9, STAT3, and TAF9B. Finally, we characterized an exon of TAF9B as partially nested within the neighboring gene phosphoglycerate kinase 1. As this study only  examined two animals, even more transcriptional variation may be present in a genetically diverse population. This analysis reveals the large amount of transcriptional variation within mammalian fertility genes and illuminates the fact that the transcriptional landscape cannot be fully characterized using a single technology alone.	0
35346463	Estimating the effect of different work practices and technologies on labor efficiency within pasture-based dairy systems.	Herd size expansion combined with the seasonal workload on pasture-based dairy farms has led to an increased focus on techniques that can improve farm labor efficiency such as work practices and technologies. The objective of this study was to identify the work practices and technologies associated with labor efficiency of particular tasks, and estimate the time savings that could be made  through their implementation during the period of peak labor input on spring-calving dairy farms. Data from an existing labor time-use study, completed from February 1 to June 30, 2019 (150 d), on 76 Irish dairy farms was used in conjunction with a survey on work practice and technology implementation. One hundred ten work practices and technologies were included in the initial survey,  and of these, 59 were found to have an association with labor efficiency for their respective tasks. Best practice, regarding labor efficiency, was identified for the 59 work practices and technologies. An accumulation score was compiled for work practice and technology implementation; each farm received one point for each work practice or technology implemented. On average, farms implemented 31 labor-efficient work practices and technologies (ranging from 10-45). The most labor-efficient 25% of farms implemented a greater number of work practices and technologies (n = 37) than the least labor-efficient 25% of farms (n = 25). Multiple regression models estimated that each additional work practice or technology implemented would improve farm labor efficiency by 0.6 h/cow. Additionally, backward-regression models were used to predict the labor-savings associated with the most important work practices and technologies. Labor-savings were estimated for 12 significant individual work practices and technologies, of  which 5 were related to milking, 4 to calf care, 2 to cow care, and one to grassland management. The work practices and technologies that offered the largest labor-savings included having one person in the milking pit during the mid-lactation period (-3.04 h/cow), having automatic cluster removers present (-2.55 h/cow) and contracting slurry spreading (-1.78 h/cow). This study focused  on the variety of labor-efficient work practices and technologies available and highlighted those that farmers should focus on to improve labor efficiency. The results indicated that there is scope for improvement in the adoption of labor-saving work practices and technologies on many farms. The positive effect of implementing the identified labor-saving techniques on labor efficiency could  be used to support future adoption.	0
35396559	Identification of cow-level risk factors and associations of selected blood macro-minerals at parturition with dystocia and stillbirth in Holstein dairy cows.	A deeper understanding of the risk factors for dystocia and stillbirth could help farmers make decisions about dairy cow management. The objectives of this study were to investigate cow-level risk factors associated with dystocia and stillbirth in a relatively large sample of dairy cows using multivariable linear  regression models. The data consisted of 51,405 calving records of 14,546 Holstein cows from 3 dairy herds in Isfahan Province, Iran, collected between April 2011 and September 2017. To investigate the association between selected blood macro-minerals and the incidence of dystocia and stillbirth, blood samples  were collected at the time of parturition from a random subset of these cows, which included 1311 animals. The incidence of dystocia and stillbirths averaged 14.7% and 4.3%, respectively. Results showed that calving year, calving season, dry period length, BCS, parity, calf sex, calf birth weight, twin status, and stillbirth were significantly associated with the incidence of dystocia. According to the Random Forest (RF) classifier, we found that dry period length,  calf birth weight, and parity were the most important cow-level risk factors for  the incidence of dystocia. Calving year, calving season, parity, twin status, dry period length, calf birth weight, calf sex, and dystocia were significantly associated with the incidence of stillbirths. The most important risk factors identified by the RF classifier for stillbirths were twin status, parity, dry period length, and calf birth weight. Also, interactions between the cow-level risk factors associated with dystocia and stillbirth were identified. The incidence of dystocia was associated with the interactions of twin status × calf  birth weight and twin status × stillbirth. According to our analysis, the incidence of stillbirth is caused by interactions among several factors, such as  twin status × length of dry period, twin status × calving season, and twin status × parity. The highest incidence of dystocia (21.3%) and stillbirths (5.4%) was observed in hypo-calcemic cows. In conclusion, twin status seems to be a determining factor for the incidence of stillbirths but not for dystocia. Finally, the results of this study may help the dairy industry make management decisions aimed at reducing dystocia and stillbirth rates.	0
35324862	Blood Inflammatory, Hydro-Electrolytes and Acid-Base Changes in Belgian Blue Cows Developing Parietal Fibrinous Peritonitis or Generalised Peritonitis after Caesarean Section.	This study aimed to describe the inflammation, hydro-electrolyte and acid-base imbalances caused by generalised peritonitis (GP) and parietal fibrinous peritonitis (PFP) after caesarean section. After clinical examination, blood was  sampled from 11 cows with PFP, 30 with GP and 14 healthy cows. Serum and plasma refractometry and glutaraldehyde tests were used to evaluate the inflammation level, while hydro-electrolytes and acid-base parameters were assessed using an EPOC® device. In addition to clinical signs of dehydration (&gt;10%), blood analysis showed a high fibrinogen concentration (PFP: 8.64 ± 8.82 g/L; GP: 7.83 ± 2.45 g/L) and fast glutaraldehyde coagulation (&lt;3 min) indicative of severe inflammation in both diseases compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, a severe decrease in electrolytes concentration (Na+: 126.93 ± 5.79 mmol/L; K+: 3.7 ± 1.3 mmol/L; Ca++: 0.89 ± 0.12 mmol/L; Cl-: 82.38 ± 6.45 mmol/L) and a significant increase in bicarbonate (30.87 ± 8.16 mmol/L), base excess (5.71 ± 7.42 mmol/l), L-lactate (8.1 ± 4.85 mmol/L) and creatinine (3.53 ± 2.30 mg/dL) were observed in cows with GP compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.05). In contrast, few major perturbations were noticed in PFP, where only K+ (3.64 ± 0.25 mmol/L) and Ca++ (1.06 ± 0.09 mmol/L) were significantly modified (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, a high dehydration and severe inflammation are induced by PFP and GP. Nevertheless, GP causes more electrolytes and acid-base disturbances  than PFP.	0
35325612	Antimicrobial use on Australian dairy cattle farms - A survey of veterinarians.	AIMS: The aims of this study were to determine antimicrobial prescription patterns and the factors affecting antimicrobial selection amongst Australian dairy veterinarians. METHODS: A structured questionnaire was administered to Australian dairy cattle veterinarians using the Qualtrics online survey platform. Questions focused on their (1) demographics; (2) opinions surrounding antimicrobial use, resistance, and stewardship; (3) decision-making drivers of both prescription and selection of commonly prescribed antimicrobials; (4) awareness on the guidelines for antimicrobial usage and sources of information concerning antimicrobials. KEY RESULTS: A total of 135 responses (14.1% response rate) from all eight dairying regions in Australia were received. The attitudes, perceptions, and concerns of dairy veterinarians towards antimicrobials indicated a high agreement regarding label indications (96%), consequences of off-label prescription (95%),  and the presence of an antimicrobial resistance (AMR) risk (73%), when prescribing antibiotics. A four-dimensional categorical principal components analysis (CATPCA) model indicated most of the variation in opinion was due to AMR risk, trade-offs, prescription concerns and active substance concerns. The first  active substance most dairy veterinarians chose for a scenario involving mastitis and dry cow therapy (DCT) treatment was cloxacillin. Decision-making drivers for  antimicrobial choice when providing advice regarding the supply of antimicrobials for mastitis and DCT treatment were predominately clinical factors; however, diagnostics were rarely used in determining antimicrobial choice due to cost of implementation, diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity), and benefit issues. Non-clinical decision-making drivers included the perception of practicality for Australian Veterinary Association (AVA) prescription guidelines, opinions surrounding AMR risk and prescription concerns, consideration of Expert  Advisory Group on Antimicrobial Resistance (EAGAR) scores, number of years worked with dairy farms, and the number of dairy farms they regularly consult for. When  available at the practice, prescription policies were considered to impact on animal welfare outcomes and on the probability of AMR emergence. The major information sources influencing decision making on antimicrobial prescription for the Australian dairy veterinarians were clinical experience (93%) and product labels (81%). CONCLUSIONS: Australian dairy veterinarians are generally aware of the risk of resistance to antimicrobials and the need for stewardship, with clinical factors  having the most impact on antimicrobial prescription. However, non-clinical factors incorporating awareness of guidelines and their attitudes on antimicrobial resistance risk and prescription concerns impact on the choice and  prescription of antimicrobials. IMPLICATIONS: The development of prescription policy and guidelines, alongside effective communicative extension programs to increase veterinarian uptake, provides an avenue to mitigate AMR risk in Australian dairy cattle.	0
35454290	Frequency of an X-Linked Maternal Variant of the Bovine FOXP3 Gene Associated with Infertility in Different Cattle Breeds: A Pilot Study.	Immune adaptation plays an essential role in determining pregnancy, which has been shown to be dependent on sufficient immunological tolerance mediated by FOXP3+ regulatory T cells. Recently, an X-linked maternal single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), located 2175 base pairs upstream of the start codon in the bovine FOXP3 gene (NC_037357.1: g.87298881A&gt;G, rs135720414), was identified in Japanese Black (JB: Bos taurus) cows in association with recurrent infertility. However, with the exception of JB cows, the frequency of this SNP has yet to be studied in other cow populations. In this study, we thus aimed to evaluate the frequency of this SNP in different cow breeds. Between 2018 and 2021, a total of  809 DNA samples were obtained from 581 JB, 73 Holstein Friesian (HF: B. taurus),  125 Korean Hanwoo (KH: B. taurus coreanae), and 30 Indonesian Madura (IM: a crossbreed between B. indicus and B. javanicus) cows, which were genotyped using  a TaqMan probe-based real-time polymerase chain reaction assay designed in this study. The frequency of the G allele was found to be relatively high in local IM  (0.700), moderate in dairy HF (0.466), and low in beef JB (0.250) and KH (0.112)  cows, with differences in the frequencies between each group being shown to be statistically significant (p &lt; 0.005) using Fisher's exact test. The results obtained in this study indicate that the G allele frequencies of the identified the SNP differ markedly in different breeds of taurine and indicine cattle. Given these findings, it would thus be important to evaluate the relationships between  high frequencies of the G allele and infertility in different breeds.	0
35391635	An established kidney cell line from humpback grouper (Cromileptes altivelis) and its susceptibility to bacteria and heavy metals.	Humpback grouper (Cromileptes altivelis), one kind of commercial fish with considerable economic value, has been recognized as a promising candidate for mariculture. In the wake of the development of aquaculture industry, the breeding density of C. altivelis has increased gradually, which gave rise to the occurrence of various pathogenic diseases. In our research, we established a new  kidney cell line (designated as CAK) from humpback grouper and evaluated its susceptibility to bacteria and heavy metals. The results of our study showed that the optimal growth temperature was 26 °C, and optimal medium was L-15 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The sequencing of 18S rRNA gene indicated that CAK cell line was derived from C. altivelis. Chromosome analysis showed that the number of chromosome in CAK was 48. After being transfected of pEGFP-N3 plasmid, high transfection efficiency of CAK was observed, suggesting the potential to be used for the study of foreign functional genes. Moreover, the bacterial susceptibility results revealed that CAK cells were sensitive to Vibrio harveyi and Edwardsiella tarda, especially V. harveyi. Meanwhile, three heavy metals (Hg, Cu, and Cd) had toxic effects on the CAK cells with a dose-dependent  manner. To sum up, the CAK cell line might be an ideal tool in vitro for analyzing the function of exogenous genes, bacterial susceptibility, and toxicity assay of heavy metals.	0
35335018	Design and Characterization of a Recombinant Brucella abortus RB51 Vaccine That Elicits Enhanced T Cell-Mediated Immune Response.	Brucella abortus vaccines help control bovine brucellosis. The RB51 strain is a live attenuated vaccine with low side effects compared with other live attenuated brucellosis vaccines, but it provides insufficient protective efficacy. Cell-mediated immune responses are critical in resistance against intracellular bacterial infections. Therefore, we hypothesized that the listeriolysin O (LLO) expression of Listeria monocytogenes, BAX, and SMAC apoptotic proteins in strain  RB51 could enhance vaccine efficacy and safety. B. abortus RB51 was transformed separately with two broad-host-range plasmids (pbbr1ori-LLO and pBlu-mLLO-BAX-SMAC) constructed from our recent work. pbbr1ori-LLO contains LLO,  and pBlu-mLLO-BAX-SMAC contains the mutant LLO and BAX-SMAC fusion gene. The murine macrophage-like cell line J774A.1 was infected with the RB51 recombinant strain containing pBlu-mLLO-BAX-SMAC, RB51 recombinant strain containing LLO, and RB51 strain. The bacterial cytotoxicity and survival and apoptosis of host cells  contaminated with our two strain types-RB51 recombinants or the parental RB51-were assessed. Strain RB51 expressing mLLO and BAX-SMAC was tested in BALB/c mice and a cell line for enhanced modulation of IFN-γ production. LDH analysis showed that the RB51-mLLO-BAX-SMAC and RB51-LLO strains expressed higher cytotoxicity in J774A.1 cells than RB51. In addition, RB51 recombinants had lower macrophage survival rates and caused higher levels of apoptosis and necrosis. Mice vaccinated with the RB51 recombinant containing mLLO-BAX-SMAC showed an enhanced Th1 immune response. This enhanced immune response is primarily due to bacterial endosome escape and bacterial antigens, leading to improved apoptosis and cross-priming. This potentially enhanced TCD8+- and T cell-mediated immunity  leads to the increased safety and potency of the RB51 recombinant (RB51 mLLO-BAX-SMAC) as a vaccine candidate against B. abortus.	0
35331896	Cow-related factors associated with intramammary infections during the 1st week postpartum in primiparous dairy cows in certified organic herds.	The objectives if this exploratory study were to identify variables associated with intramammary infections (IMI) during the 1st week of lactation in primiparous organic dairy cows, and to evaluate the association of those variables with somatic cell count (SCC) linear scores and milk yield in early lactation. Nulliparous cows (n = 240) were evaluated for: udder edema, teat edema, milk leakage (ML) and udder hygiene at weeks 6, 4, 2, and 1 prepartum and  1st week postpartum; body condition score (BCS) at 6 weeks prepartum and 1st week postpartum; age at calving (days), gestation length, dystocia, stillbirth, calf sex were included in the analysis. Milk samples from the 1st week postpartum were cultured using standard laboratory techniques and bacterial growth was considered IMI. Intramammary infection was observed in 58.7% of cows, with Staphylococcus chromogenes and S. aureus being the most prevalent pathogens. Cows with ML at 1st week postpartum were at 3.42 greater odds of IMI (P < 0.01). Cows with prepartum  BCS ≥ 3.75 were at 3.12 greater odds of IMI (P < 0.01). Cows with ML in the 1st week of lactation had increased SCC (P < 0.01) and lower milk production in the second month of lactation (P = 0.05). Intervention studies are needed to evaluate if monitoring prepartum BCS and ML at early postpartum can aid in the control of  IMIs in heifers in organic dairies.	0
35379459	Novel functional mutation of the PDIA3 gene affects milk composition traits in Chinese Holstein cattle.	Protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3 (PDIA3) is a multifunctional protein, and it plays a vital role in modulating various cell biological functions under physiological and pathological conditions. Our previous study on  Mediterranean buffalo demonstrated that PDIA3 is a potential candidate gene associated with milk yield based on genome-wide association study analysis. However, the genetic effects of the PDIA3 gene on milk performance in dairy cattle and the corresponding mechanism have not been documented. This study aims  to explore the genetic effects of PDIA3 polymorphisms on milk production traits in 362 Chinese Holstein cattle. The results showed that 4 SNPs were identiﬁed from the 5' untranslated region of the PDIA3 gene in the studied population, of which 2 SNPs (g.-1713 C>T and g.-934 G>A) were confirmed to be significantly associated with milk protein percentage, whereas g.-434 C>T was significantly associated with milk fat percentage. Notably, linkage disequilibrium analysis indicated that 3 SNPs (g.-1713 C>T, g.-934 G>A, and g.-695 A>C) formed one haplotype block, which was found to be significantly associated with milk protein percentage. The luciferase assay demonstrated that allele C of g.-434 C>T exhibited a higher promotor activity compared with allele T, suggesting that g.-434 C>T might be a potential functional mutation affecting PDIA3 expression. Furthermore, overexpression of the PDIA3 gene was found to induce higher levels of triglyceride and BODIPY fluorescence intensity. In addition, PDIA3 overexpression was also found to positively regulate the synthesis and secretion  of α-casein, β-casein, and κ-casein, whereas knockdown of this gene showed the opposite effects. In summary, our findings revealed significant genetic effects of PDIA3 on milk composition traits, and the identified SNP and the haplotype block might be used as genetic markers for dairy cow selected breeding.	0
35434167	Heart Rate Variability May Predict the Severity of Appendicitis: A Cross-Sectional Study.	Objective: To evaluate the role of heart rate variability (HRV) in predicting pre-operative severity of appendicitis. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 171 cases of acute appendicitis who underwent appendectomy were enrolled. Pre-anesthetic pulse rate of included patients were documented while the severity of appendicitis was determined by intra-operative evidences reported by two independent surgeons. Demographic characteristics, laboratory variables, and Alvarado criteria were recorded. Results: The mean age of patients was 28.75±4.21 years; 54% were men. HRV negatively associated the severity of appendix inflammation. A positive association was found between HRV and omental wrapping and Alvarado score (p<0.01). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that HRV could differentiate simple and complicated appendicitis with a sensitivity of 78.5% and specificity of 97.2%. Conclusion: The present findings revealed that HRV may predict the pre-operative  severity of appendicitis and help differentiate simple and complicated appendicitis.	0
35361825	Methane emissions and rumen metabolite concentrations in cattle fed two different silages.	In this study, 18 animals were fed two forage-based diets: red clover (RC) and grass silage (GS), in a crossover-design experiment in which methane (CH4) emissions were recorded in respiration chambers. Rumen samples obtained through naso-gastric sampling tubes were analysed by NMR. Methane yield (g/kg DM) was significantly lower from animals fed RC (17.8 ± 3.17) compared to GS (21.2 ± 4.61) p = 0.008. In total 42 metabolites were identified, 6 showing significant differences between diets (acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, 3-phenylopropionate, and 2-hydroxyvalerate). Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used to assess which metabolites were more important to distinguish between diets and partial least squares (PLS) regressions were used to assess which metabolites were more strongly associated with the variation in CH4 emissions. Acetate, butyrate and propionate along with dimethylamine were important for the distinction between diets according to the PLS-DA results. PLS  regression revealed that diet and dry matter intake are key factors to explain CH4 variation when included in the model. Additionally, PLS was conducted within  diet, revealing that the association between metabolites and CH4 emissions can be conditioned by diet. These results provide new insights into the methylotrophic methanogenic pathway, confirming that metabolite profiles change according to diet composition, with consequences for CH4 emissions.	0
35337242	How Relationships Foster Growth: Compassionate Goals Predict Growth-Seeking Through Perceived Available Support Independent of Relationship Security.	Growth-seeking refers to a general tendency to pursue growth when facing challenges. The current studies examined whether and how benevolent intentions to support others and not harm them (i.e., compassionate goals in relationships) predict growth-seeking and whether this association is independent of relationship security, which may also predict growth-seeking. Two cross-sectional studies (Studies 1a and 1b, N = 1,032) and two longitudinal studies (Study 2: 3-wave weekly survey, N = 404; Study 3: 12-wave weekly survey, N = 230) showed that compassionate goals correlate with growth-seeking and predict increased growth-seeking over time through perceived available support. The results hold after controlling for participants' (Studies 1-3) and their partners' (Study 3) relationship security, which suggests that compassionate goals may foster growth-seeking through perceived available support independent of relationship security. In addition, Study 3 suggests an intrapersonal process (i.e., projected perceptions) underlying the link between compassionate goals and perceived available support.	0
35427666	A multi-tissue biomonitoring investigation of toxic trace elements and their trophic transfer potential in a semi aquatic bird species, the Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis).	The constant exposure of toxic trace elements can elicit adverse health effects particularly in birds and species residing higher at the food web. The current study is designed to evaluate the tendency of toxic trace elements viz. Cd, Cr, Pb, Cu, As and Hg to bioaccumulate in liver, kidney, blood, pelvic and pectoral muscles of cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis) collected from premises of a metropolitan city, Lahore, Pakistan. Further, the Trophic Transfer Potential of these elements was also estimated using prey/food samples of cattle egret. All of the selected toxic trace elements except Hg and As were detected with varying concentrations in different tissues of cattle egret. In general, toxic trace elements followed the pattern as Cu > Pb > Cd > Cr in tissues of cattle egret. The maximum mean (Min-max) concentrations (μg/g) of Cu 0.58 (0.11-0.93) and Pb 0.46 (0.40-0.54) in blood and Cd at 0.46 (0.40-0.54) were observed in liver. Similarly, the highest mean (min-max) concentration (μg/g) of Cr 0.17 (0.09-0.25) was recorded in pectoral muscle. In general, blood and liver were found as the most contaminated  tissues followed by kidney, pectoral and pelvic muscles. Differences of trace elements were found non-significant (all P > 0.05) among tissues of cattle egret  reflecting their homogenous distribution in body. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) corroborated lack of strong association between any of the trace elements and tissues. All the toxic trace elements except Cr showed higher tendency of trophic transfer potential through food chain in all the tissues of Cattle Egret  (TTF >1). Although the current study revealed decreasing trends of toxic trace elements, yet their still presence in the local environment and greater likelihood of trophic transfer can undoubtedly cause some severe health effects to the already declining bird populations.	0
35307738	Unsuppressed Striatal Activity and Genetic Risk for Schizophrenia Associated With Individual Cognitive Performance Under Social Competition.	BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: Social competition affects human behaviors by inducing psychosocial stress. The neural and genetic mechanisms of individual differences  of cognitive-behavioral response to stressful situations in a competitive context remain unknown. We hypothesized that variation in stress-related brain activation and genetic heterogeneity associated with psychiatric disorders may play roles towards individually differential responses under stress. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 419 healthy subjects and 66 patients with schizophrenia  were examined functional magnetic resonance imaging during working memory task including social competition stressors. We explored the correlation between stress-induced brain activity and individual working memory performance. The partial least squares regression was performed to examine the genetic correlates  between stress-related activity and gene expression data from Allen Human Brain Atlas. Polygenic risk score (PRS) was used to assess individual genetic risk for  schizophrenia. STUDY RESULTS: Greater suppression of bilateral striatal activity was associated  with better behavioral improvement in working memory manipulation under social competition (left: rPearson = -0.245, P = 4.0 × 10-6, right: rPearson = -0.234, P = 1.0 × 10-5). Genes transcriptionally related to stress-induced activation were  linked to genetic risk for schizophrenia (PFDR < 0.005). Participants with decreased accuracy under social competition exhibited higher PRS of schizophrenia (t = 2.328, P = .021). Patients with schizophrenia showed less suppressed striatal activity under social stress (F = 13.493, P = 3.5 × 10-4). CONCLUSIONS: Striatal activity change and genetic risk for schizophrenia might play a role in the individually behavioral difference in working memory manipulation under stress.	0
35450719	Reproductive tract disease in Irish grazing dairy cows: Retrospective observational study examining its association with reproductive performance and accuracy of 2 diagnostic tests.	The detection of reproductive tract disease (RTD) 3 wk postpartum is important because of its effect on subsequent reproductive outcomes. Numerous methods for the diagnosis of RTD are described, some of which are more practical and instantaneous in terms of diagnosis. Two of these methods involve identification  of purulent vaginal discharge (PVD) and evidence of ultrasonographic uterine changes indicative of endometritis (UE). The objectives of our retrospective observational study were (1) to assess the association of PVD or UE score at the  prebreeding examination (PBE) with the hazard of pregnancy within the subsequent  breeding season; (2) to determine the test sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp)  at the point of sampling of both tests using a Bayesian latent class model; and (3) to determine the effect of varying positivity thresholds on test accuracy. To achieve these objectives, we analyzed an initial data set of 5,049 PBE from 2,460 spring-calved cows in 8 herds between 2014 and 2018. Each PBE was conducted once  between 25 and 86 d in milk. At each PBE, vaginal discharge was obtained with a Metricheck device (Simcro) whereas uterine contents were assessed using transrectal ultrasonography. Purulent vaginal discharge was scored on a scale of  0 to 3 depending on discharge character, and UE was scored on a scale of 0 to 4 depending on the presence and consistency of intraluminal fluid. Cows with scores of ≥2 in either test had received treatment. Fertility data were available from 4,756 PBE after data exclusion. The association between PVD or UE score at the PBE and subsequent hazard of pregnancy was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model. Cows with a PVD score of 2 or 3 were less likely to conceive than  cows with a PVD score 0 [score 2 hazard ratio (HR) = 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.59-0.94; score 3 HR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.51-0.84]. Cows with a UE score of 1, 2, 3, or 4 were less likely to conceive than cows with a UE score of  0 (score 1 HR = 0.82; 95% CI: 0.73-0.93; score 2 HR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.62-1.00; score 3 HR = 0.43; 95% CI: 0.43-0.90; score 4 HR = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.26-0.58). To determine the Se and Sp of PVD or UE score for diagnosis of RTD at the time of PBE, a Bayesian latent class model was fitted on 2,460 individual cow PBE. Flat priors were used for the Se and Sp of UE, whereas informative priors were used for PVD Se (mode = 65%, 5th percentile = 45%) and Sp (mode = 90%, 5th percentile  = 80%) and RTD prevalence (mode = 20%, 5th percentile = 10%). Posterior estimates (median and 95% Bayesian probability intervals; BPI) were obtained using 'rjags'  (R Studio). The optimal test thresholds (PVD and UE score ≥1) were selected by assessing the effect of different thresholds on test estimates and using a misclassification cost analysis. Based on these, median (95% BPI) Se for PVD and  UE score ≥1 were 44% (29-60%) and 67% (33-100%), respectively. Median Sp for PVD  and UE score ≥1 were 90% (86-93%) and 91% (86-93%), respectively. Higher scores in both tests were associated with impaired fertility, and UE scoring with a threshold of ≥1 had the highest test Se and Sp estimates although test Se was conditional on days in milk when the PBE occurred.	0
35256121	Rumen fluke infections (Paramphistomidae) in diarrhoeal cattle in western France  and association with production parameters.	This study was conducted to assess the impact of rumen flukes (RFs) (Paramphistomatidae) on various production parameters of cattle in Normandy. Faecal and blood samples were taken between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2019 as part of the routine diagnostic activity for diarrhoea in weaned cattle, including a quantitative parasitological analysis coupled with a search for Johne's disease (paratuberculosis). Information on slaughter and carcass weight,  inter-farm movements and mortality was obtained from the French national registration database (BDNI). The study was conducted at two levels using adapted categorical RF variables: 1) at the cattle level (>12 months), an estimation of presence of adult parasites using egg count in faecal samples (negative vs. positive) and 2) at the herd level, an estimation of 6-24 months of the dairy heifers exposure to larval forms on the basis of the proportion of dairy cattle shedding eggs in the herd (three classes). At the cattle level, the outcome variables were carcass weight (model 1), case-control status for mortality within 30 days of diagnosis (model 2) and case-control status for slaughter within 365 days of diagnosis (model 3). At the herd level, the outcome variable was the  mortality ratio for dairy heifers aged 6-24 months (Model 4). Other important covariates were used to improve model fit. Multivariate analyses were performed using a linear mixed model (model 1), generalised estimating equations (GEE) (models 2 and 3) and a multinomial logistic model (model 4). Overall, 1291 out of 4315 cattle (29.9%) were found to excrete RF eggs and 19.6% of the positives had  an excretion score of >200 eggs/g. The prevalence increased steadily with age class and was higher in beef cattle than dairy cattle (42.7% vs. 26.9%) in the years 2015-2019 compared to 2010-2014 (33.3% vs. 26.5%) and in November-February  (33.2%) compared to March-June (28.9%) and July-October (27.3%). Rumen fluke variables were not found to be explanatory factors of outcome variables at both animal and herd levels. In contrast, significant negative associations were observed between outcome variables and other health covariates, such as Johne's disease, GI nematode, bovine viral diarrhoea and coccidia statuses. In conclusion, RFs are prevalent in cattle reared in Normandy but this does not result in significant production losses. Therefore, the value to farmers of oxyclozanide treatment at an effective dose for paramphistomosis after simple identification of RF eggs in the faeces seems limited.	0
35248887	Non-destructive biomarkers can reveal effects of the association of microplastics and pharmaceuticals or personal care products.	Methods to assess the effects of contaminants on marine organisms typically involve euthanasia to obtain samples, but less invasive techniques may be more appropriate for working with threatened species. In this study, were assessed the biological responses of crabs exposed to microplastics and contaminants of emerging concern. Biochemical and cellular effects (lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, cholinesterase activity, and lysosomal membrane stability) in hemolymph were analyzed in a kinetic study, at 3 and 7 days, in U. cordatus exposed to microplastics spiked with Triclosan (TCS) or 17α-Ethynylestradiol (EE2). The results showed that the contaminants were produced toxic effects in the crabs exposed either to the microplastics alone (oxidative stress, genotoxicity, and neurotoxicity), or to microplastics with TCS or EE2 adsorbed (neurotoxic and cytotoxic). The present study showed the responsiveness of non-lethal analyzes to understanding the biological effects of combined exposure to microplastics and chemical pollution.	0
35281838	The Association Between Genomic Heterozygosity and Carcass Merit in Cattle.	The objective of the present study was to quantify the association between both pedigree and genome-based measures of global heterozygosity and carcass traits, and to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) exhibiting non-additive associations with these traits. The carcass traits of interest were carcass weight (CW), carcass conformation (CC) and carcass fat (CF). To define the genome-based measures of heterozygosity, and to quantify the non-additive associations between SNPs and the carcass traits, imputed, high-density genotype  data, comprising of 619,158 SNPs, from 27,213 cattle were used. The correlations  between the pedigree-based heterosis coefficient and the three defined genomic measures of heterozygosity ranged from 0.18 to 0.76. The associations between the different measures of heterozygosity and the carcass traits were biologically small, with positive associations for CW and CC, and negative associations for CF. Furthermore, even after accounting for the pedigree-based heterosis coefficient of an animal, part of the remaining variability in some of the carcass traits could be captured by a genomic heterozygosity measure. This signifies that the inclusion of both a heterosis coefficient based on pedigree information and a genome-based measure of heterozygosity could be beneficial to limiting bias in predicting additive genetic merit. Finally, one SNP located on Bos taurus (BTA) chromosome number 5 demonstrated a non-additive association with CW. Furthermore, 182 SNPs (180 SNPs on BTA 2 and two SNPs on BTA 21) demonstrated a non-additive association with CC, while 231 SNPs located on BTA 2, 5, 11, 13, 14, 18, 19 and 21 demonstrated a non-additive association with CF. Results demonstrate that heterozygosity both at a global level and at the level of individual loci contribute little to the variability in carcass merit.	0
35242464	A Cyanotic Infant: Infrequent Presentation of Cow's Milk Protein Allergy.	We report the case of a three-month-old boy who presented with poor weight gain,  loose stools, and poor oral intake for three weeks. Physical examination revealed a pale infant with abdominal distension and cyanosis. Oxygen saturation was normal, but the laboratory showed important methemoglobinemia. The diagnosis of FPIES (food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome) in the context of cow's milk  protein allergy (CMPA) was suspected. Although CMPA is a common condition encountered in small children, chronic forms of FPIES can be difficult to diagnose. Maintaining clinical suspicion about the potential association between  methemoglobinemia and gastrointestinal symptoms can lead to prompt recognition and intervention.	0
35193006	Polycarbonate plastic monomer (bisphenol-A) as emerging contaminant in Nigeria: Levels in selected rivers, sediments, well waters and dumpsites.	Despite decades of research into the environmental fate and levels of the endocrine-disrupting polycarbonate Plastic monomer, bisphenol-A (BPA), data remain scarce from many developing countries. Here, occurrence and levels of BPA  were investigated in water and sediments of three rivers, selected dumpsites and  well waters in Ondo State, Southwestern Nigeria. The study also investigated the  influence of matrix physicochemical characteristics on their BPA retention. BPA values ranged from 0.41-5.19 μg/L in river waters, 0.64-10.6 μg/kg in river sediments, 0.63-0.68 μg/L in well waters and 0.72-1.09 μg/kg in waste dumpsites.  BPA concentrations in the river waters showed a strong association with chemical  oxygen demand (COD) values. High BPA concentrations were also found associated with high chloride contents of drinking well waters. Detection in river and well  waters revealed exposure routes of humans, cattle and aquatic species to BPA in the region.	0
35280590	Prevalence of Anaplasma marginale in cattle blood samples collected from two important livestock regions in Punjab (Pakistan) with a note on epidemiology and  phylogeny of parasite.	Anaplasmosis, caused by intracellular gram-negative bacteria Anaplasma marginale  is one of the most frequently reported tick-borne disease (TBDs) in tropical and  sub-tropical countries, including Pakistan. In the present study, a total of 428  cattle blood samples were collected to examine the prevalence and phylogenetic origin of A. marginale in two important livestock regions of Punjab Province in Pakistan, i.e. Lodhran and Dera Ghazi Khan Districts. In addition, association between occurrence of A. marginale in cattle blood and selected epidemiological factors has been also investigated. The presence of A. marginale genetic material was confirmed in 9% of the tested blood samples taken from cattle in Lodhran and  in 17% from Dera Ghazi Khan. Prevalence of A. marginale was significantly higher  in cattle from Dera Ghazi Khan. All the cattle breeds from both districts were equally susceptible to A. marginale infection. We reported higher prevalence of A. marginale in cattle living indoors or with other dairy animals in Dera Ghazi Khan district. However, no such relationship was observed in the Lodhran district. Sequencing of the msp1b gene shows 96-99% similarity of A. marginale in the study area to those reported from other parts of Pakistan, South Africa, and  Israel. We recommend that large scale tick and tick-borne disease control strategies must be implemented in both districts.	0
35447249	Genome-wide elucidation of CNV regions and their association with production and  reproduction traits in composite Vrindavani cattle.	The present study was aimed to analyze the genome-wide copy number variations (CNVs) in Vrindavani composite cattle and concatenate them into CNV regions (CNVRs), and finally test the association of CNVRs with different production and  reproduction traits. Genotypic data, generated on BovineSNP50 Beadchip (v3) array for 96 Vrindavani animals, was used to elucidate the CNVs at the genome level. Intensity data covering over 53,218 SNP genotypes on bovine genome was used. Algorithm based on Hidden Markov Model was employed in PennCNV program to detect, normalize and filter CNVs across the genome. 252 putative CNVs, detected via PennCNV program, in different individuals were concatenated into 71 CNV regions (CNVRs) using CNVRuler program. Association of CNVRs with important (re)production traits in Vrindavani animals was assessed using linear regression. Five CNVRs were found to be significantly associated with ten important (re)production traits. The genes harbored in these regions provided useful insights into the association of CNVRs with genes and ultimately the variation at phenotype level. Important genes that overlapped with CNVRs included WASHC4, HS6ST3, MBNL2, TOLLIP, PIDD1 and TSPAN4. Furthermore, the CNVRs were found to overlap with important QTLs available in AnimalQTL database which affect milk yield and composition along with reproduction and immune function traits. The copy number states of three enes were validated using digital droplet PCR technique. The results from the present study significantly enhance the understanding about CNVs in Vrindavani cattle and should help establish its CNV map. The study will also enable further investigation on association of these variants with important traits of economic interest including disease incidence.	0
35284917	Why are women with polycystic ovary syndrome obese?	INTRODUCTION: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition characterized by reproductive, hyperandrogenic and dysmetabolic features, and often becomes clinically manifest during adolescence, particularly with weight-gain. SOURCES OF DATA: Pubmed search. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: PCOS is heritable and closely associates with obesity (based  on data from both epidemiological and genetic studies). Furthermore, insulin resistance forms a central cornerstone of the pathogenesis of PCOS and mediates a close association between obesity and the severity of the phenotypic features of  PCOS. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Our understanding of the pathogenesis of PCOS remains incomplete, especially regarding its missing heritability (with only a small fraction having been identified from the genome-wide association studies reported to date), and its developmental origins. GROWING POINTS: A challenge for the future is to explore a role for epigenetic modifications in the development of PCOS, and implications for the in utero environment and novel therapeutic opportunities.	0
35285715	Genetic Characteristics of the Transmissible Locus of Stress Tolerance (tLST) and tLST Harboring Escherichia coli as Revealed by Large-Scale Genomic Analysis.	The transmissible locus of stress tolerance (tLST) confers resistance to multiple stresses in E. coli. Utilizing 18,959 E. coli genomes available in the NCBI database, we investigated the prevalence, phylogenetic distribution, and configuration patterns of tLST, and correlations between tLST, and virulence and  antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in E. coli. Four tLST variants were found in 2.7% of E. coli, with the most prevalent (77.1%) variant being tLST1 followed by  tLST2 (8.3%), tLST3b (8.3%) and tLST3a (6.3%). The majority (93%) of those tLST were in E. coli belonging to phylogroup A in which the prevalence was 10.4%. tLST was also found in phylogroup B1 (0.5%) and C (0.5%) but not found in B2 or D-G. An additional 1% of the 18,959 E. coli genomes harbored tLST fragments to various extent. Phylogenetic analysis revealed both intra- and interspecies transmission  of both chromosomal and plasmid-borne tLST, with E. coli showing a preference of  chromosomal over plasmid-borne tLST. The presence of tLST and virulence genes in  E. coli was overall negatively correlated, but tLST was found in all genomes of a subgroup of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ST2332). Of note, no Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (n = 3,492) harbored tLST. The prevalence of tLST and AMR genes showed different temporal trends over the period 1985 to 2019. However, a substantial fraction of tLST positive E. coli harbor AMR genes, posing a threat to public health. In conclusion, this study improves our understanding of the genetic characteristics of tLST and E. coli harboring tLST. IMPORTANCE This study, through a large-scale genomic analysis, demonstrated that the genomic island tLST related to multiple stress resistance (such as extreme heat resistance and oxidative stress tolerance) in E. coli is differentially present in subgroups of  E. coli and is strongly associated with certain phylogenetic background of the host strain. The study also shows the transmission mechanisms of tLST in E. coli  and other bacterial species. The overall negative association of tLST, and virulence genes and antimicrobial (AMR) genes suggest the selective pressures for the acquisition and transmission of these traits likely differ. Even so, the high prevalence of tLST in the enterotoxigenic E. coli clone ST2332 and co-occurrence  of tLST and AMR genes in E. coli are concerning. Thus, the findings better our understanding of tLST evolution and provide information for risk assessment of tLST harboring bacteria.	0
35446746	Bioinformatics and genetic variants analysis of FGF10 gene promoter with their association at carcass quality and body measurement traits in Qinchuan beef cattle.	The fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) gene regulates adipogenesis and myogensis. In this study, sequencing of FGF10 prompter region identified three SNPs at loci g.78G > A, g.116C > T and g.201A > T. Each SNP yields three genotypes as GG, GA and AA at loci g.78G > A, CC, CT and TT at loci g.116C > T and AA, AT and TT at loci g.201A > T. Allelic and genotypic frequencies of all three SNPs deviated from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) (P < 0.05) and were found highly polymorphic as PIC (0.25 < PIC < 0.50). Moreover, we found highest LD (D'/γ2) between SNP2 and SNP3 (0.989/0.909), followed by SNP1 and SNP3 (0.944/0.796). Moreover, three variants of FGF10 gene promoter exhibited significant (P < 0.05) association with body measurement and carcass quality traits in Qinchuan beef cattle. At loci g.78G > A, the genotype GG showed significantly (P < 0.01) larger body length (BL), rump length (RL), chest depth (CD), chest circumference (CC) and ultrasound loin area (ULA). The genotype TC at loci g.116C > T showed significantly (P < 0.01 and 0.05) larger body measurement  and intramuscular fat, and ultrasound loin area (ULA). In addition to that, at loci g.201A > T, genotype TT showed significantly (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05) larger  body length (BL), rump length (RL), hip width (HW), chest circumference (CC) and  ultrasound loin area (ULA). Additionally, screening of promoter sequence of FGF10 gene explored loss of four TFs binding sites (KLF3, ZNF37α, GLIS2 and BCL11A) at  g.116C > T because of SNP2. However, a single TF binding site was lost at g.202A > T due to SNP3. Interestingly, none of TF binding site was lost at g.78G > A in SNP1; however, one new TF binding site was gained at this location due to SNP1. These findings conclude that genotype GG, TC and TT could be used as genetic markers of FGF10 gene for body measurement and carcass quality traits in  Qinchuan beef cattle.	0
35451516	Identification of two new recessive MC1R alleles in red-coloured Evolèner cattle  and other breeds.	Sequence variations in the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene are associated with melanism in different animal species. Six functionally relevant alleles have been described in cattle to date. In a hypothesis-free approach we performed a genome-wide allelic association study with black, red and wild-coloured cattle of three Alpine cattle breeds (Eringer, Evolèner and Valdostana), revealing a single significant association signal close to the MC1R gene. We searched for candidate  causative variants by sequencing the entire coding sequence and identified two novel protein-changing variants. We propose designating the mutant alleles at MC1R:c.424C>T as ev1 and at MC1R:c.263G>A as ev2 . Both affect conserved amino acid residues in functionally important transmembrane domains (p.Arg142Cys and p.Ser88Asn). Both alleles segregate predominantly in the Swiss Evolèner breed. They occur in other European cattle breeds such as Abondance and Rotes Höhenvieh  as well. We observed almost perfect association between the MC1R genotypes and the coat colour phenotype in a cohort of 513 black, red and wild-coloured cattle. Animals carrying two copies of MC1R loss-of-function alleles or that were compound heterozygous for e, ev1 , or ev2 have a red to dark red (chestnut-like red) coat colour. These findings expand the spectrum of causal MC1R variants causing recessive red in cattle.	0
35453176	Antimicrobial Resistance and Molecular Characterization of Staphylococcus aureus  Recovered from Cows with Clinical Mastitis in Dairy Herds from Southeastern Brazil.	Staphylococcus aureus is a contagious pathogen frequently associated with bovine  mastitis in Brazil. Molecular characterization of Staph. aureus isolated from affected mammary quarters of cows with clinical mastitis (CM) can provide data on epidemiological behavior of this pathogen and antimicrobial susceptibility (AMS)  assessment at the genotypic level. This study genotypically characterized Staph.  aureus isolates recovered from cows with CM and determined the association of genotypes and AMS. A total of 84 Staph. aureus strains identified from affected mammary quarters of cows with CM in 13 dairy herds from Southeastern Brazil were  submitted for susceptibility testing to 10 antimicrobials using the technique of  minimal inhibitory concentration. The same isolates were also genotyped using the spa-typing methodology. Results showed a high genotypic similarity between the Staph. aureus isolates within and between herds, which were categorized as resistant to most antimicrobials, especially to β-lactam antibiotics. In addition, differences in AMS were observed among genotypic clusters, which may affect the efficacy of antimicrobials used to treat CM in different dairy herds.	0
35446841	A locus conferring tolerance to Theileria infection in African cattle.	East Coast fever, a tick-borne cattle disease caused by the Theileria parva parasite, is among the biggest natural killers of cattle in East Africa, leading  to over 1 million deaths annually. Here we report on the genetic analysis of a cohort of Bos indicus (Boran) cattle demonstrating heritable tolerance to infection with T. parva (h2 = 0.65, s.e. 0.57). Through a linkage analysis we identify a 6 Mb genomic region on bovine chromosome 15 that is significantly associated with survival outcome following T. parva exposure. Testing this locus  in an independent cohort of animals replicates this association with survival following T. parva infection. A stop gained variant in a paralogue of the FAF1 gene in this region was found to be highly associated with survival across both related and unrelated animals, with only one of the 20 homozygote carriers (T/T)  of this change succumbing to the disease in contrast to 44 out of 97 animals homozygote for the reference allele (C/C). Consequently, we present a genetic locus linked to tolerance of one of Africa's most important cattle diseases, raising the promise of marker-assisted selection for cattle that are less susceptible to infection by T. parva.	0
35369840	Progress and future perspectives of livestock genomics in India: a mini review.	The field of genetics has evolved a lot after the emergence of molecular and advanced genomic technologies. The advent of Next Generation Sequencing, SNP genotyping platforms and simultaneous reduction in the cost of sequencing had opened the door to genomic research in farm animals. There are various applications of genomics in livestock, such as the use of genomic data: (i) to investigate genetic diversity and breed composition/population structure (ii) to  identify genetic variants and QTLs related to economically important and ecological traits, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic signatures  of selection; (iii) to enhance breeding programs by genomic selection. Compared to traditional methods, genomic selection is expected to improve selection response by increasing selection accuracy and reducing the generation interval due to early selection. Genomic selection (GS) in developed countries has led to  rapid genetic gains, especially in dairy cattle, due to a well-established genetic evaluation system. Indian livestock system is still lagging behind developed nations in adopting these technologies. This review discusses the current status, challenges, and future perspectives of livestock genomics in India.	0
35422847	Whole-Genome Sequencing of Endangered Dengchuan Cattle Reveals Its Genomic Diversity and Selection Signatures.	Dengchuan cattle are the only dairy yellow cattle and endangered cattle among Yunnan native cattle breeds. However, its genetic background remains unclear. Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing of ten Dengchuan cattle. Integrating our data with the publicly available data, Dengchuan cattle were observed to be highly interbred than other cattle in the dataset. Furthermore, the positive selective signals were mainly manifested in candidate genes and pathways related  to milk production, disease resistance, growth and development, and heat tolerance. Notably, five genes (KRT39, PGR, KRT40, ESR2, and PRKACB) were significantly enriched in the estrogen signaling pathway. Moreover, the missense  mutation in the PGR gene (c.190T > C, p.Ser64Pro) showed a homozygous mutation pattern with higher frequency (83.3%) in Dengchuan cattle. In addition, a large number of strong candidate regions matched genes and QTLs related to milk yield and composition. Our research provides a theoretical basis for analyzing the genetic mechanism underlying Dengchuan cattle with excellent lactation and adaptability, crude feed tolerance, good immune performance, and small body size  and also laid a foundation for genetic breeding research of Dengchuan cattle in the future.	0
35347440	Effect of inseminator on reproductive performance in dairy cattle.	The reproductive efficiency of dairy cattle is critical to the economic success and sustainability of the enterprise. Due to its many advantages, artificial insemination has inevitably taken its place in herd management today, and different artificial insemination methods have been developed until today. At the same time, artificial insemination is carried out by commercial artificial insemination operators or do-it-yourself operators in cattle farms. One of the factors affecting the success of artificial insemination is inseminators. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of inseminators on conception rates in  reproductive challenges and to reveal the differences between the success rates of inseminators. A total of 227,297 artificial insemination acts carried out by 35 inseminators for 4 years belonging to the Konya Cattle Breeders' Association in Turkey were assessed for this purpose. In the study, the insemination success  rate was determined as 41.36%. In addition, the percentage of inseminators with a total insemination success rate of more than 50% is very low, such as 2.9%, and the percentage of those who achieved 35.9% and below was 9.3%. As a result, it can be stated that the inseminators having a lower success rate than the overall  should be retrained to avoid costs or losses in the farms.	0
35265999	Cross-Disorder Analysis of Shared Genetic Components Between Cortical Structures  and Major Psychiatric Disorders.	BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: Although large-scale neuroimaging studies have demonstrated similar patterns of structural brain abnormalities across major psychiatric disorders, the underlying genetic etiology behind these similar cross-disorder patterns is not well understood. STUDY DESIGN: We quantified the extent of shared genetic components between cortical structures and major psychiatric disorders (CS-MPD) by using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of 70 cortical structures (surface area and thickness of the whole cortex and 34 cortical regions) and five major psychiatric disorders, consisting of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and schizophrenia (SCZ). Cross-disorder analyses were then conducted to estimate the degree of similarity in CS-MPD shared genetic components among these disorders. STUDY RESULTS: The CS-MPD shared genetic components have medium-to-strong positive correlations in ADHD, BD, MDD, and SCZ (r = 0.415 to r = 0.806) while ASD was significantly correlated with ADHD, BD, and SCZ (r = 0.388 to r = 0.403). These pairwise correlations of CS-MPD shared genetic components among disorders were significantly associated with corresponding cross-disorder similarities in cortical structural abnormalities (r = 0.668), accounting for 44% variance. In addition, one latent shared factor consisted primarily of BD, MDD, and SCZ, explaining 62.47% of the total variance in CS-MPD shared genetic components of all disorders. CONCLUSIONS: The current results bridge the gap between shared cross-disorder heritability and shared structural brain abnormalities in major psychiatric disorders, providing important implications for a shared genetic basis of cortical structures in these disorders.	0
35413103	Candidate genes for polycystic ovary syndrome are regulated by TGFβ in the bovine foetal ovary.	STUDY QUESTION: Could changes in transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signalling during foetal ovary development alter the expression of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) candidate genes leading to a predisposition to PCOS? SUMMARY ANSWER: TGFβ signalling molecules are dynamically expressed during foetal ovary development and TGFβ1 inhibits expression of the androgen receptor (AR) and 7 (INSR, C8H9orf3, RAD50, ERBB3, NEIL2, IRF1 and ZBTB16) of the 25 PCOS candidate genes in foetal ovarian fibroblasts in vitro, whilst increasing expression of the AR cofactor TGFβ-induced transcript 1 (TGFB1I1 or Hic5). WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The ovarian stroma arises from the mesonephros during foetal ovary development. Changes in the morphology of the ovarian stroma are cardinal features of PCOS. The ovary is more fibrous and has more tunica and cortical and subcortical stroma. It is not known why this is and when this arises. PCOS has a foetal origin and perhaps ovarian stroma development is altered during foetal life to determine the formation of a polycystic ovary later in life. PCOS also has a genetic origin with 19 loci containing 25 PCOS candidate genes. In many adult tissues, TGFβ is known to stimulate fibroblast replication and collagen deposition in stroma, though it has the opposite effect in the non-scaring foetal tissues. Our previous studies showed that TGFβ signalling molecules [TGFβs and their receptors, latent TGFβ binding proteins (LTBPs) and fibrillins, which are extracellular matrix proteins that bind LTBPs] are expressed in foetal ovaries. Also, we previously showed that TGFβ1 inhibited expression of AR and 3 PCOS candidate genes (INSR, C8H9orf3 and RAD50) and stimulated expression of TGFB1I1 in cultured foetal ovarian fibroblasts. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We used Bos taurus for this study as we can ethically collect foetal ovaries from across the full 9-month gestational period. Foetal ovaries (62-276 days, n = 19) from across gestation were collected from pregnant B. taurus cows for RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses. Foetal ovaries from B. taurus cows were collected (160-198 days, n = 6) for culture of ovarian fibroblasts. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: RNA-seq transcriptome profiling was performed on foetal ovaries and the data on genes involved in TGFβ signalling were extracted. Cells were dispersed from foetal ovaries and fibroblasts cultured and treated with TGFβ1. The effects of TGFβ regulation on the remaining eight PCOS candidate genes not previously studied (ERBB3, MAPRE1, FDFT1, NEIL2, ARL14EP, PLGRKT, IRF1 and ZBTB16) were examined. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Many TGFβ signalling molecules are expressed in the foetal ovary, and for most, their expression levels increased accross gestation (LTBP1/2/3/4, FBN1, TGFB2/3, TGFBR2/3 and TGFB1I1), while a few decreased (FBN3, TGFBR3L, TGFBI and TGFB1) and others remained relatively constant (TGFBRAP1, TGFBR1 and FBN2). TGFβ1 significantly decreased expression of PCOS candidate genes ERBB3, NEIL2, IRF1 and ZBTB16 in cultured foetal ovarian fibroblasts. LARGE SCALE DATA: The FASTQ files, normalized data and experimental information have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accessible by accession  number GSE178450. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Regulation of PCOS candidate genes by TGFβ was  carried out in vitro and further studies in vivo are required. This study was carried out in bovine where foetal ovaries from across all of the 9-month gestational period were available, unlike in the human where it is not ethically  possible to obtain ovaries from the second half of gestation. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: From our current and previous results we speculate that inhibition of TGFβ signalling in the foetal ovary is likely to (i) increase androgen sensitivity by enhancing expression of AR, (ii) increase stromal activity by stimulating expression of COL1A1 and COL3A1 and (iii) increase the expression of 7 of the 25 PCOS candidate genes. Thus inhibition of TGFβ signalling could be part of the aetiology of PCOS or at least the aetiology  of polycystic ovaries.

35362202	Transcriptional states and chromatin accessibility during bovine myoblasts proliferation and myogenic differentiation.	OBJECTIVES: Although major advances have been made in bovine epigenome study, the epigenetic basis for fetal skeletal muscle development still remains poorly understood. The aim is to recapitulated the time course of fetal skeletal muscle  development in vitro, and explore the dynamic changes of chromatin accessibility  and gene expression during bovine myoblasts proliferation and differentiation. METHODS: PDGFR- cells were isolated from bovine fetal skeletal muscle, then cultured and induced myogenic differentiation in vitro in a time-course study (P, D0, D2,and D4). The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were performed. RESULTS: Among the enriched transcriptional factors with high variability, we determined the effects of MAFF, ZNF384, and KLF6 in myogenesis using RNA interference (RNAi). In addition, we identified both stage-specific genes and chromatin accessibility regions to reveal the sequential order of gene expression, transcriptional regulatory, and signal pathways involved in bovine skeletal muscle development. Further investigation integrating chromatin accessibility and transcriptome data was conducted to explore cis-regulatory regions in line with gene expression. Moreover, we combined bovine GWAS results of growth traits with regulatory regions defined by chromatin accessibility, providing a suggestive means for a more precise annotation of genetic variants of bovine growth traits. CONCLUSION: Overall, these findings provide valuable information for understanding the stepwise regulatory mechanisms in skeletal muscle development and conducting beef cattle genetic improvement programs.	0
35318385	Unraveling structural and conformational dynamics of DGAT1 missense nsSNPs in dairy cattle.	Cattle are domestic animals that have been nourishing humans for thousands of years. Milk from cattle represents a key source of high-quality protein, fat, and other nutrients. The nutritional value of milk and dairy products is closely associated with the fat content, providing up to 30% of the total fat consumed in the human diet. The fat content in cattle milk represents a major concern for the scientific community due to its association with human health. The relationship between milk fat content and diacylglycerol o-acyltransferase 1 gene (DGAT1) is well described in literature. Several studies demonstrated the difference in fat  contents and other milk production traits in a wide range of cattle breeds, to be associated with missense non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs)  of the DGAT1 gene. As a result, an nsSNPs analysis is crucial for unraveling the  DGAT1 structural and conformational dynamics linked to milk fat content. DGAT1-nsSNPs are yet to be studied in terms of their structural and functional impact. Therefore, state-of-the-art computational and structural genomic methods  were used to analyze five selected variants (W128R, W214R, C215G, P245R, and W459G), along with the wild type DGAT1. Significant structural and conformational changes in the variants were observed. We illustrate how single amino acid substitutions affect DGAT1 function, how this contributes to our understanding of the molecular basis of variations in DGAT1, and ultimately its impact in improving fat quality in milk.	0
35332227	MiRNAs in milk can be used towards early prediction of mammary gland inflammation in cattle.	Considering the importance of early disease detection for reducing the huge financial and animal welfare impact of bovine mastitis globally, improved tools are urgently needed that can accurately detect early mammary inflammation. MiRNAs have demonstrated value as disease biomarkers, however, their potential for accurately detecting early mammary inflammation has not been examined in detail.  To address this, we investigated the association between levels of four inflammation-associated miRNAs (bta-miR-26a, bta-miR-142-5p, bta-miR-146a and bta-miR-223) and CMT scores (0 to 3) obtained from a large number of individual quarter milk samples (n = 236) collected from dairy cows at different lactations  (1 to 4). Initial analyses (n = 21 samples) confirmed that the levels of each of  bta-miR-142-5p, bta-miR-146a and bta-miR-223 in whole milk were significantly correlated with mRNA levels of known inflammatory markers (HP, TNF, CXCL8 and IL1B) in milk cells (Rho ≥ 0.49, P < 0.005). Subsequent analyses (n = 215 samples) revealed a significant effect of CMT score on each of the four miRNAs analysed (P < 0.0001), characterised by a progressive increase in miRNA levels in milk as CMT score increase from 0 to > 1. Moreover, a significant effect of lactation number (P < 0.01) for bta-miR-26a, bta-miR-142-5p and bta-miR-146a was  attributed to higher miRNA levels during lactation 1 than later lactations. Finally, by generating ROC curves we showed that bta-miR-223 and bta-miR-142-5p levels could identify early inflammatory changes in individual quarter milk samples (CMT1) with high accuracy (100% sensitivity, > 81% specificity). Our results provide novel proof of the value of miRNAs as early diagnostic biomarkers of bovine mastitis.	0
35433046	Knowledge, Consumption Pattern, and Adverse Effects of Energy Drinks among Asian  Population: A Cross-Sectional Analysis from Malaysia.	Background: The frequent expansion of the energy drinks (EDs) market has caused an extensive increase in the consumption of EDs, especially among younger populations. However, the lack of knowledge on EDs and their perceived beneficial effects could lead to excessive EDs consumption, which is strongly associated with serious side effects. This study aimed to assess the knowledge and perceived beneficial effects of EDs consumers and determine the consumption patterns and side effects experienced by different EDs consumers among the Malaysian population. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in Malaysia from February to April 2021. A structured and validated questionnaire, consisting of 5 sections with 46 items, was distributed online. Only 515 out of 591 invited participants agreed to participate in the study. Descriptive and inferential analysis were done using SPSS. Results: The median age of participants was 23 ± 7.3 years. The majority of participants (65%) were unaware of the active ingredients of EDs, and approximately 40% of them had no idea that EDs contain caffeine. The main reason  for consuming EDs was to stay awake (43%), and Red Bull was the most preferred brand (57%). Lack of rest (57%), headache (53%), and nervousness (49%) were the most experienced side effects. A significant difference was observed between consumption patterns and knowledge and perceived beneficial effects (p < 0.05). Our data showed a significant association between respondents' demographic data (e.g., coffee intake, smoking, and alcohol status) and their consumption pattern. Conclusion: ED consumers in Malaysia were found to have limited knowledge on EDs. Therefore, attention should be drawn to the Ministry of Health regarding the significant side effects such as palpitation and nervousness experienced by ED consumers. Hence, awareness ought to be raised by adopting regulations or policies to regulate the sales and warning labels of EDs in Malaysia.	0
35239467	Hispanic Ethnicity and Social Determinants of Health in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension: The Pulmonary Hypertension Association Registry.	Rationale There is a noticeable underrepresentation of minorities in clinical trials and registries in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Prior studies evaluating the association between Hispanic ethnicity and clinical outcomes in patients with PAH have not assessed the socioeconomic profile of Hispanic individuals or the significance of social determinants of health in clinical outcomes. Objective To determine the association between Hispanic ethnicity, social determinants of health, and clinical outcomes in PAH. Methods Prospective  cohort study of adult participants with PAH enrolled in the Pulmonary Hypertension Association Registry, a multicenter US-based registry of patients treated at Pulmonary Hypertension Care Centers. Participants were classified as Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites, based on self-reported ethnicity. A comparison of baseline clinical and sociodemographic characteristics between groups was performed as well using absolute standardized differences (ASD). The primary outcome of the study was to assess transplant-free survival between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites. A Cox proportional hazards model was used for the multivariable analysis after adjusting for age, sex, PAH etiology, annual income, education level and health insurance. Results A total of 683 individuals were included, 98 (14.3%) of Hispanic ethnicity. Hispanic patients had impaired access to health care (31.6% vs. 12.9% Medicaid/uninsured; ASD 0.35), lower education level (72.6% vs. 94.0% high school graduates or higher; ASD 0.60) and lower annual income (32.0% vs. 17.4% with income <20,000 US dollars; ASD 0.47), as compared with non-Hispanic Whites. Hispanic patients had a higher frequency of ER visits and a higher number of hospitalizations, despite having similar disease severity (incidence rate ratio 1.452, 95% CI 1.326 - 1.590 and 1.428, 95% CI 1.292 - 1.577, respectively). While the unadjusted analysis showed a lower transplant/death hazard ratio for Hispanics (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.24-0.94; p=0.032), there was no association between Hispanic ethnicity and outcome in the multivariable model after adjusting for social determinants of health and other covariates (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.35-1.62; p=0.474). Conclusions Hispanic ethnicity was not associated with differences in survival after adjusting for social determinants of health and other factors. Social determinants of health are important to consider when assessing the association between ethnicity and outcomes in PAH.	0
35355225	Pupillary correlates of individual differences in long-term memory.	The present study is the first to examine individual differences in long-term memory, arousal dysregulation, and intensity of attention within the same experiment. Participants (N = 106) completed 28 lists of an immediate free-recall task while their pupil diameter was recorded via an eye-tracker during the encoding period. Two main pupillary measures were extracted: intraindividual variability in pre-list pupil diameter and evoked pupillary responses during item encoding. Variability in pre-list pupil diameter served as a measure of arousal dysregulation, and evoked pupillary responses served as a measure of intensity of attention. Based on prior work, we hypothesized that there would be a positive association between intensity of attention and recall ability, and that there would be a negative association between arousal dysregulation and recall ability. Collectively these two measures accounted for 19% of interindividual variance in  recall, with 5% attributable uniquely to intensity of attention and 12% attributable uniquely to arousal regulation. The findings demonstrate that there  are sources of individual differences in long-term memory that can be revealed via pupillometry, notably the amount of effort deployed during item encoding and  the degree to which people exhibit dysregulated arousal. Both findings are consistent with recent theorizing regarding the role of the locus coeruleus (LC)-norepinephrine (NE) system's role in goal-directed cognition. Specifically,  the LC governs both moment-to-moment arousal and NE release to cortical regions subserving cognitive processing. Among people for whom this system operates most  optimally, long-term memory retention is superior.	0
35379466	Association of residual feed intake with peripartal ruminal microbiome and milk fatty acid composition during early lactation in Holstein dairy cows.	Residual feed intake (RFI) is a moderately heritable trait of feed efficiency in  dairy cows. The main objective of the present study was to assess potential differences in the ruminal microbiome, milk fatty acid (FA) composition, and plasma concentrations of glucose, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), and β-hydroxybutyrate between the most (M-EFF) and the least efficient (L-EFF) dairy  cows during early lactation. Forty-seven multiparous Holstein dairy cows with daily ad libitum access to a total mixed ration from 30 d before calving to 30 d  in milk were used. Cows were retrospectively classified into M-EFF (i.e., low RFI, n = 29) and L-EFF (high RFI, n = 18) based on a linear regression model. Ruminal digesta and milk samples were collected from each cow at 15 and 30 d in milk for microbiome analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Microbiome sequencing data were analyzed with the QIIME 2 platform (http://qiime.org/), whereas the microbiome statistical analyses and visual explorations were performed using the web-based MicrobiomeAnalyst platform. Milk FA composition was measured via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The statistical model used in  SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.) included RFI, time, and their interactions as fixed  effects. The cor() function in R programming was used to determine Pearson correlations between relative abundance of significant bacteria and milk FA. Overall, daily milk yield did not differ due to RFI and averaged 42 ± 1.6 kg for  L-EFF and 43 ± 1.3 kg for M-EFF cows. However, M-EFF cows had lower overall dry matter intake (14.9 ± 0.5 kg/d) compared with L-EFF cows (19.2 ± 0.6 kg/d). No incidence of clinical disease was recorded for cows in the study. Compared with L-EFF, overall glucose concentration was lower, whereas NEFA and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were greater in M-EFF cows. Ruminal digesta from both RFI groups had similar bacterial composition, but differed in the relative abundance of some bacteria. Compared with L-EFF, M-EFF cows had greater relative  abundance of Lachnospiraceae, Lachnoclostridium, Papillibacter, Desulfovibrio, Sphaerochaeta, Acetobacter, and Histophilus. In contrast, relative abundance of Bifidobacterium, Ruminiclostridium, Prevotellaceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium was lower in M-EFF cows. Compared with L-EFF, M-EFF cows had greater proportions of long-chain monounsaturated FA, including 16:1 trans-9, 16:1 cis-9, 17:1 trans-10, 17:1 cis-10, 18:1 cis-9, 18:1 cis-11, whereas proportions of medium-chain saturated and 16:0 were lower in M-EFF. Acetate-producing bacteria (Sphaerochaeta and Acetobacter) were positively and significantly correlated (r ≥ 0.24) with concentrations of 16:1 cis-9 and 17:1 cis-10, whereas Prevotellaceae was significantly and negatively correlated (r = -0.25) with these FA. Butyrate-producing bacterium (Papillibacter) had a significant negative correlation (r = -0.27) with concentration of 15:0. Overall, data suggested that  feed-efficient cows have unique profiles of ruminal microbiota, some of which are correlated with concentrations of milk FA during early lactation.	0
35359744	In vitro Susceptibility of Human Cell Lines Infection by Bovine Leukemia Virus.	Evidence of the presence of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) in human beings and its association with breast cancer has been published in the literature, proposing it as a zoonotic infection. However, not enough evidence exists about transmission pathways nor biological mechanisms in human beings. This study was aimed at gathering experimental evidence about susceptibility of human cell lines to BLV infection. Malignant and non-malignant human cell lines were co-cultured with BLV-infected FLK cells using a cell-to-cell model of infection. Infected human cell lines were harvested and cultured for 3 to 6 months to determine stability of infection. BLV detection was performed through liquid-phase PCR and visualized through in situ PCR. Seven out of nine cell lines were susceptible to BLV infection as determined by at least one positive liquid-phase PCR result in the 3-month culture period. iSLK and MCF7 cell lines were able to produce a stable infection throughout the 3-month period, with both cytoplasmic and/or nuclear BLV-DNA visualized by IS-PCR. Our results support experimental evidence of BLV infection in humans by demonstrating the susceptibility of human cells to BLV infection, supporting the hypothesis of a natural transmission from cattle to humans.	0
35456882	Antibiotic Resistance and Molecular Profiling of the Clinical Isolates of Staphylococcus aureus Causing Bovine Mastitis from India.	Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic bacterium known to cause severe infections in humans and animals. It is one of the major bacteria causing subclinical and clinical mastitis, leading to significant economic losses in livestock industry. In this study, we have isolated and characterized 80 S. aureus clinical isolates from mastitis-infected animals. The analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility, molecular typing, biofilm production and genetic determinants was performed to understand molecular and phenotypic features of the prevalent pathogen. Our antibiotic susceptibility assays showed the majority (57.5%) of isolates to be multidrug-resistant (MDR), 38.75% resistant and 3.75% sensitive. We found 25% isolates to be methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) based on oxacillin susceptibility assays. In the MRSA group, maximum isolates (95%) were MDR compared to 45% in MSSA. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) revealed 15 different STs; ST-97 was the most common ST, followed by ST-2459, ST-1, ST-9 and ST-72. The agr typing showed agr-I as the most common type, followed by type II and III. Most isolates developed biofilms, which ranged in intensity from strong to weak. The presence or absence of lukS, a virulence-related gene, was found to have a substantial relationship with the biofilm phenotype. However, no significant association was found between biofilm  formation and antimicrobial resistance or other virulence genes. We also found four MRSA isolates that were mecA negative based on molecular assays. Our findings reveal the prevalence of multidrug-resistant S. aureus clinical isolates in India that are biofilm positive and have critical genetic factors for disease  pathogenesis causing bovine mastitis. This study emphasizes the need for the comprehensive surveillance of S. aureus and other mastitis-causing pathogens to control the disease effectively.	0
35300540	Pathology of the peripheral neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4H in Holstein Friesian cattle with a splice site mutation in FGD4.	Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a hereditary sensory and motor peripheral neuropathy that is one of the most common inherited neurological diseases of humans and may be caused by mutations in a number of different genes. The subtype Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4H (CMT4H) is caused by homozygous mutations in  the FGD4 (FYVE, RhoGEF, and PH domain-containing 4) gene. A previous genome-wide  association study involving 130,783 dairy cows found 6 novel variants, one of which was a homozygous splice site mutation in the FGD4 gene. Descendants of carriers were genotyped to identify 9 homozygous Holstein Friesian calves that were raised to maturity, of which 5 were euthanized and sampled for histopathology and electron microscopy at 2 and 2.5 years of age. Three control Holstein Friesian animals were raised with the calves and euthanized at the same  time points. No macroscopic lesions consistent with CMT4H were seen at necropsy.  Microscopically, peripheral nerves were hypercellular due to hyperplasia of S100-positive Schwann cells, and there was onion bulb formation, axonal degeneration with demyelination, and increased thickness of the endoneurium. On electron microscopy, decreased axonal density, onion bulb formations, myelin outfoldings, and increased numbers of mitochondria were present. These changes are consistent with those described in mouse models and humans with CMT4H, making these cattle a potential large animal model for CMT.	0
35202171	Practical Application of Urinary Zearalenone Monitoring System for Feed Hygiene Management of a Japanese Black Cattle Breeding Herd-The Relationship between Monthly Anti-Müllerian Hormone and Serum Amyloid A Concentrations.	This study addresses an advantageous application of a urinary zearalenone (ZEN) monitoring system not only for surveillance of ZEN exposure at the production site of breeding cows but also for follow-up monitoring after improvement of feeds provided to the herd. As biomarkers of effect, serum levels of the anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and serum amyloid A (SAA) concentrations were used.  Based on the results of urinary ZEN measurement, two cows from one herd had urinary ZEN concentrations which were two orders of magnitude higher (ZEN: 1.34 mg/kg, sterigmatocystin (STC): 0.08 mg/kg in roughages) than the levels of all cows from three other herds (ZEN: not detected, STC: not detected in roughages).  For the follow-up monitoring of the herd with positive ZEN and STC exposure, urine, blood, and roughage samples were collected from five cows monthly for one  year. A monitoring series in the breeding cattle herd indicated that feed concentrations were not necessarily reflected in urinary concentrations; urinary  monitoring assay by ELISA may be a simple and accurate method that reflects the exposure/absorption of ZEN. Additionally, although the ZEN exposure level appeared not to be critical compared with the Japanese ZEN limitation in dietary  feeds, a negative regression trend between the ZEN and AMH concentrations was observed, indicating that only at extremely universal mycotoxin exposure levels,  ZEN exposure may affect the number of antral follicles in cattle. A negative regression trend between the ZEN and SAA concentrations could also be demonstrated, possibly indicating the innate immune suppression caused by low-level chronic ZEN exposure. Finally, significant differences (p = 0.0487) in  calving intervals between pre-ZEN monitoring (mean ± SEM: 439.0 ± 41.2) and post-ZEN monitoring (349.9 ± 6.9) periods were observed in the monitored five cows. These preliminary results indicate that the urinary ZEN monitoring system may be a useful practical tool not only for detecting contaminated herds under field conditions but also provides an initial look at the effects of long-term chronic ZEN/STC (or other co-existing mycotoxins) exposure on herd productivity and fertility.	0
35209806	Association between copy number variation of SERPINA3-1 gene and growth traits in Chinese cattle.	Serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade A (alpha-1 antiproteinase, antitrypsin), member 3 (SERPINA3) belongs to the serine protease inhibitor family A subtype, and contains 8 genes from SERPINA3-1 to SERPINA3-8. Although the regulatory effects of these 8 genes have been revealed one by one in recent years, the related effects of SERPINA3-1 gene on cattle growth is still unclear. This study used quantitative Real time PCR (qPCR) to detect the type of copy number variation (CNV) of SERPINA3-1 gene in a total of 542 Chinese cattle, and expression of SERPINA3-1 gene in different tissues of Qinchuan cattles (adult) on mRNA level. Then association analysis was conducted between the detection results and cattle  growth traits. The results showed that the Duplication type in SERPINA3-1 gene performed better on the growth traits and the CNV was significantly correlated with multiple growth traits (p < 0.05). In addition, SERPINA3-1 gene has different expression conditions in different tissues, results showed that SERPINA3-1 gene has a low expression in muscle. In conclusion, we speculate that  the SERPINA3-1 gene can be used as a molecular marker and the result of this study could be a basic material for candidate functional genes for beef cattle growth and development.	0
35304331	A novel role for GalNAc-T2 dependent glycosylation in energy homeostasis.	OBJECTIVE: GALNT2, encoding polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (GalNAc-T2), was initially discovered as a regulator of high-density lipoprotein  metabolism. GalNAc-T2 is known to exert these effects through post-translational  modification, i.e., O-linked glycosylation of secreted proteins with established  roles in plasma lipid metabolism. It has recently become clear that loss of GALNT2 in rodents, cattle, nonhuman primates, and humans should be regarded as a  novel congenital disorder of glycosylation that affects development and body weight. The role of GALNT2 in metabolic abnormalities other than plasma lipids, including insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis, is poorly understood. METHODS: GWAS data from the UK Biobank was used to study variation in the GALNT2  locus beyond changes in high-density lipoprotein metabolism. Experimental data were obtained through studies in Galnt2-/- mice and wild-type littermates on both control and high-fat diet. RESULTS: First, we uncovered associations between GALNT2 gene variation, adiposity, and body mass index in humans. In mice, we identify the insulin receptor as a novel substrate of GalNAc-T2 and demonstrate that Galnt2-/- mice exhibit decreased adiposity, alterations in insulin signaling and a shift in energy substrate utilization in the inactive phase. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies a novel role for GALNT2 in energy homeostasis, and our findings suggest that the local effects of GalNAc-T2 are mediated through posttranslational modification of the insulin receptor.	0
35282905	Daily behavioral measures recorded by precision technology devices may indicate bovine respiratory disease status in preweaned dairy calves.	Precision technology devices can measure and detect relative changes in an animal's behavior to possibly create alerts to intervene and to administer treatments. However, the association of relative changes in daily feeding and activity behaviors in calves with bovine respiratory disease (BRD) status is still largely unexplored. The objective of this case-control study was to determine if daily behavioral patterns of preweaning dairy calves (measured by precision technologies) change before BRD diagnosis. This case-control study enrolled 33 pairs of calves (33 BRD calves matched by age, sex, and birthdate to  33 controls) health scored daily for BRD for the preweaning period (until 50 d on the automated feeder). A pedometer (IceQube, Ice Robotics) was attached to the left rear leg to track activity (lying time, lying bouts, total steps, and acceleration activity index). At 3.0 ± 2.0 d of age, calves were trained to use the automated feeder, which recorded milk and calf starter intake, drinking speed, and feeder visits. Calves were allotted a maximum 10 L/d of milk replacer  (Cow's Match, Land O'Lakes Animal Milk Products Co.; 140 g/L) and starter (Special Calf Starter and Grower, Baghdad Feeds), ad libitum. Calves were scored  daily for signs of BRD using the Wisconsin scoring system, and their lungs were scored with ultrasonography twice weekly. Outward signs of BRD as defined by the  Wisconsin scoring system and an area of consolidated lung ≥3.0 cm2 was identified as BRD (d 0). Relative changes in daily behaviors were calculated using d -5 before BRD diagnosis as the baseline for each calf for each behavior. Linear mixed models were used to investigate the association of BRD status with feeding  behaviors, activity, and relative changes in calf behavior over a 5-d period before diagnosis, as well as the BRD status × day interaction. Calves with a BRD  bout were diagnosed at an average age of 33.0 ± 9.0 d (mean ± standard deviation) and weighed 56.1 ± 9.7 kg. Over the period, BRD calves had reduced milk and starter intake, greater lying times, and fewer lying bouts, step counts, and activity indices when compared with healthy calves. Furthermore, there was a BRD  status × day interaction for relative changes in unrewarded visits, and relative  changes in calf starter intake. Specifically, BRD calves had a decline in relative changes in their unrewarded visits on d -4, -2, -1, and 0 compared with  healthy calves. This study suggests that there is the potential to use feeding and activity behaviors to identify BRD development in preweaning calves. However, utilization of an animals' daily behavioral patterns in real time is fundamental  for developing disease detection algorithms, thus we suggest relative changes in  unrewarded visits may be useful for algorithm development when d -5 is used as a  baseline. Future research should investigate the potential of feeding behavior and activity levels collectively to indicate BRD status in calves using machine learning techniques.	0
35279213	Tolerance induction through early feeding to prevent food allergy in infants with eczema (TEFFA): rationale, study design, and methods of a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Up to 8% of all children in industrialized countries suffer from food allergies, whereas children with atopic eczema are affected considerably more frequently. In addition, the type and starting time of weaning foods seem to influence the development of food allergies. However, data from interventional studies on weaning are controversial. The aim of this randomized-controlled clinical trial is to investigate, whether an early introduction of hen's egg (HE), cow's milk (CM), peanut (PN), and hazelnut (HN) in children with atopic eczema can reduce the risk for developing food allergies in the first year of life. METHODS: This is a protocol for a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind, single-center clinical trial. One hundred fifty infants with atopic eczema at 4-8 months of age will be randomized in a 2:1 manner into an active group that will receive rusk-like biscuit powder with HE, CM, PN, and HN (initially approximately 2 mg of each food protein) for 6-8 months or a placebo group, whose participants will receive the same rusk-like biscuit powder without HE, CM, PN, and HN on a daily basis. During the interventional period, the amount of allergens in the study product will be increased three times, each after 6 weeks. All study participants who are sensitized to HE, CM, PN, or HN at the end of the  interventional period will undergo an oral food challenge to the respective food  in a further visit. Primary endpoint is IgE-mediated food allergy to at least one of the four foods (HE, CM, PN or HN) after 6-8 months of intervention (i.e., at around 1 year of age). Secondary endpoints include multiple food allergies, severity of eczema, wheezing, and sensitization levels against food allergens. DISCUSSION: This clinical trial will assess whether an early introduction of allergenic foods into the diet of children with atopic eczema can prevent the development of food allergies. This trial will contribute to update food allergy  prevention guidelines. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00016770 . Registered on  09 January 2020.	0
35437469	The impacts of COVID-19 on cattle traders and their response in agro-pastoral and pastoral regions in Uganda: A case of Karamoja and Teso cattle traders.	The study assessed the economic impact of COVID-19 on cattle traders in the Karamoja and Teso pastoral and agro-pastoral areas in Uganda and their response after the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. The results reveal that cattle traders were  negatively affected by COVID-19 in many ways including reduction in cattle sales, erosion in operating capital, and failure to sell animals while others have diversified or moved to other businesses. Twenty-five per cent of the cattle traders did not sell any animal during the lockdown. A majority of these were from Karamoja (43%) compared to those in Teso sub-region. The decline in cattle sales was significantly higher in Karamoja than in Teso sub-region. However, their recovery was significantly higher in Karamoja than in Teso sub-region because traders in Teso greatly diversified to other economic activities compared to traders in Karamoja sub-region. The traders who lost capital were mainly in Teso sub-region (63%). As expected, there was a sharp decline in the number of cattle buyers from markets outside the study area, mainly from Juba, Kampala, Busia, and Kenya. Coping strategies by cattle traders included crop cultivation (80%), burning charcoal (15%), selling food items (8%), and boda-boda riding (12%), while others did not engage in any economic activity (25%). To mitigate against the pandemic, traders were observing some of the standard operating procedures (SOPs) such as wearing face masks (76.1%), handwashing (19.3%), sanitising (2.3%), and social distancing (2.3%). Traders from Karamoja performed  poorly in both diversification and mitigation measures. Based on our findings, recommendations to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on cattle traders include offering loans to cattle traders through their Village Savings and Loan Association (VSLA), reducing transaction costs, offering mobile phones especially for Karamoja traders, and promoting the adoption of enforcing SOPs to reduce the  need for lockdowns and cattle market closures which are detrimental to pastoral livelihood.	0
35230546	Association between aflatoxin M1 excretion in milk and indicators of rumen fermentation in bovines.	Aflatoxins and its metabolites negatively impact the ruminant health and production. The present cross-sectional study was aimed to determine the effect of aflatoxins on rumen fermentation by deducing the correlation between the aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) excretion in milk and indicators of rumen fermentation in bovines. The indicators of rumen fermentation were taken into account and correlated with AFM1 concentration in milk of 120 bovines (cattle (n = 82) and buffalo (n = 38)). The AFM1 in milk samples (n = 120) was quantified by ELISA kit. The correlation analysis revealed that with increase in excretion of AFM1 in milk, the pH (r = 0.38), methylene blue reduction time (MBRT) (r = 0.43), sedimentation activity time (SAT) (r = 0.31) and ammonia nitrogen content (r = 0.34) of rumen liquor increase, whereas the total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) content (r =  - 0.25), total bacterial count (TBC) (r =  - 0.43) and total protozoal count (TPC) (r =  - 0.14) of rumen liquor decrease. The results of the  present study suggest that the presence of aflatoxins in rumen could have negative effect on the process of rumen fermentation. Therefore, the prevention of primary entry point(s) of AFB1 through the feed of bovines is important for the animal health as well as public health.	0
35301961	Selection of reference genes for quantitative real-time PCR normalization in the  coffee white stem borer, Xylotrechus quadripes Chevrolat (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae).	The coffee white stem borer, Xylotrechus quadripes Chevrolat (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), is a major destructive pest of Coffea arabica L. (Gentianales: Rubiaceae), widely planted in many Asian countries, including China. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a common method for quantitative analysis of gene transcription levels. To obtain accurate and reliable qRT-PCR results, it is necessary to select suitable reference genes to different experimental conditions for normalizing the target gene expression. However, the  stability of the expression of reference genes in X. quadripes has rarely been studied. In this study, the expression stability of nine candidate reference genes were investigated under biotic and abiotic conditions for use in qRT-PCR's  normalization. By integrating the results of four algorithms of NormFinder, BestKeeper, geNorm, and RefFinder, the optimal reference gene combinations in different experimental conditions were performed as follows: RPL10a and EIF3D were the optimal reference genes for developmental stage samples, EIF4E, RPL10a,  and RPS27a for tissue samples, V-ATP and EF1α for the sex samples, EIF3D and V-ATP for temperature treatment, RPS27a and RPL10a for insecticide stress, and RPL10a, RPS27a, and EF1α for all the samples. This study will help to obtain the  stable internal reference genes under biotic and abiotic conditions and lay the foundation for in-depth functional research of target genes or genomics on olfactory molecular mechanisms, temperature adaptability, and insecticide resistance in X. quadripes.	0
35304629	Epidemic abortions due to Neospora caninum infection in farmed red deer (Cervus elaphus).	This study describes for the first time an abortion outbreak caused by Neospora caninum in farmed red deer. During a 5-year period, farmed hinds, naturally mated, were regularly ultrasound monitored to detect reproductive losses over their gestation. During the 4 years previous to the outbreak, abortion rates ranged from 4.7 to 8.6% (average 6.5%), and serology for indirect diagnosis of neosporosis and toxoplasmosis was performed. At the fifth year, the abortion rate increased to 25.3%. During this outbreak, three aborted foetuses and their placentas were recovered and submitted to laboratory for etiological diagnosis. Blood samples were collected from the 81 hinds at the end of the gestational period and the seropositivity rate for N. caninum, Toxoplasma gondii, Brucella abortus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus and bovine alphaherpesvirus type 1 was 66.7%, 67.9%, 0.0%, 8.6% and 0.0%, respectively. Neospora caninum-seropositive hinds (OR = 5.7, P = 0.0271) and hinds with high antibody titres to N. caninum (OR = 7.4, P = 0.0130) were more likely to abort than seronegative hinds. In addition, N. caninum seropositivity rate in the aborted hinds was higher (OR = 5.4, P = 0.033) than the non-aborted hinds. No association was found between T. gondii nor BVDV-seropositivity and abortions. Typical protozoal histopathologic findings (necrotizing non suppurative encephalitis, meningitis, myocarditis, hepatitis, among others) were observed in all foetuses. Neospora caninum was immunolabelled by immunohistochemistry in several tissues from two foetuses, and infection was also confirmed in the three foetuses by serology and/or DNA detection. No other abortifacient agent was detected in the foetuses.  Their dams showed high N. caninum antibody titres (≥ 6400). Serologic evidence and epidemiological data recorded suggested a point-source of N. caninum infection before the occurrence of the outbreak, probably related with contaminated feedstuff with oocysts. Moreover, the intensive production system with a high stocking rate could be also considered a factor which might have increased the risk of horizontal N. caninum infection in this herd.	0
35379460	Hepatic triacylglycerol associations with production and health in dairy cows.	The objectives were to evaluate the associations between hepatic triacylglycerol  content and production, blood metabolites, incidence of diseases, reproduction, and survival in Holstein cows. Data were collected from 4 experiments including 329 cows in which hepatic tissue was sampled with a mean (± standard deviation) of 8.3 ± 1.5 d postpartum (6 to 11 d) and analyzed for triacylglycerol concentration. The mean (± standard deviation) concentration was 4.4 ± 2.8% on a  wet basis and ranged from 0.4 to 16.1%. Intakes of dry matter (DM), energy balance, body weight (BW), body condition (BCS), productive performance, and incidence of diseases were evaluated for the first 105 d postpartum, whereas blood metabolites were assayed in the first 21 d postpartum. Reproductive performance and survival were monitored in the first 300 d postpartum. Mixed models were fitted to the data to investigate the linear and quadratic associations of hepatic triacylglycerol concentration with responses of interest. Increased concentration of hepatic triacylglycerol was associated with a quadratic increase in yields of milk, energy-corrected milk (ECM), and milk components. A change in hepatic triacylglycerol from 2.5 to 7.5% of the wet tissue was associated with an increase in yield of ECM of 1.8 kg/d, and with 0.2  kg more ECM per kg of DM intake. However, the increased efficiency was accompanied by decreases in DM intake, BCS, more exacerbated losses of BW, and a  more negative body energy change. Increased concentration of hepatic triacylglycerol was associated with a quadratic increase in blood fatty acids and a linear increase in blood β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations, concurrent with linear decreases in concentrations of glucose and total Ca in blood. Moreover, a  change in hepatic triacylglycerol from 2.5 to 7.5% was associated with linear increases in the relative risk of hyperketonemia by 2.5 times (15.2 vs. 37.5%), hypocalcemia by 1.7 times (30.3 vs. 52.4%), metritis by 2.1 times (12.5 vs. 25.7%), and diagnosis of multiple diseases postpartum by 2.4 times (8.7 vs. 21.1%). Survival in the herd by 300 d postpartum tended to decrease from 91.1 to  86.3% with an increase in hepatic triacylglycerol from 2.5 to 7.5% of the wet tissue, but no association was observed between hepatic triacylglycerol and measures of reproduction in the first 300 d postpartum. Concentrations of hepatic triacylglycerol in early lactation varied substantially, and increments resulted  in quadratic association with productive performance, but at the expense of tissue reserves as those cows had increased tissue catabolism and risk of diseases that reduced survival.	0
35403911	Evaluation of bleaching efficacy, microhardness, and trans-amelodentinal diffusion of a novel bleaching agent for an in-office technique containing hexametaphosphate and fluoride.	OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated in vitro the effects of calcium gluconate (CaGlu), sodium fluoride (NaF), sodium hexametaphosphate (HMP), and NaF/TMP added to a 35% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) bleaching gel on the color change, enamel hardness, and trans-amelodentinal diffusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Enamel discs/bovine dentin (n = 150) were divided according to the bleaching gel: 35% H2O2 (H2O2); 35% H2O2 + 0.1% NaF (H2O2/NaF);  35% H2O2 + 1% HMP (H2O2/HMP); 35% H2O2 + 0.1% NaF + 1% HMP (H2O2/NaF/HMP), and 35% H2O2 + 2% CaGlu (H2O2/Caglu). The bleaching gels were applied three times (40 min/session) at 7-day intervals between each application. Then, color alteration (ΔE), whitening index (ΔWID), percentage of surface hardness loss (% SH), cross-sectional hardness (ΔKHN), and trans-amelodentinal diffusion were determined. Data were submitted for analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test (p < 0.05). RESULTS: All bleaching gels showed significant color changes after treatment (p < 0.001). ΔE and ΔWID were similar among the evaluated gels. Mineral loss (% SH and ΔKHN) and trans-amelodentinal diffusion of hydrogen peroxide were lower for H2O2/NaF/HMP; the H2O2/CaGlu group presented the highest values about the other groups (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: It is possible to conclude that the addition of NaF/HMP to the in-office bleaching agent did not interfere with the bleaching efficacy and reduced enamel demineralization and H2O2 diffusion. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The association of NaF/HMP to the bleaching gel can be used as a novel approach for minimizing the adverse effects of H2O2 by-products and with similar clinical efficacy.	0
35436852	Using mid-infrared spectroscopy to increase GWAS power to detect QTL associated with blood urea nitrogen.	Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is an indicator trait for urinary nitrogen excretion. Measuring BUN level requires a blood sample, which limits the number of records that can be obtained. Alternatively, BUN can be predicted using mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy of a milk sample and thus records become available on many more cows through routine milk recording processes. The genetic correlation between MIR predicted BUN (MBUN) and BUN is 0.90. Hence, genetically, BUN and MBUN can be considered as the same trait. The objective of our study was to perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for BUN and MBUN, compare these two GWAS and detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) for both traits, and compare the detected QTL with previously reported QTL for milk urea nitrogen (MUN). The dataset used for our analyses included 2098 and 18,120 phenotypes for BUN and MBUN, respectively, and imputed whole-genome sequence data. The GWAS for MBUN was carried out using either the full dataset, the 2098 cows with records for BUN, or 2000 randomly selected cows, so that the dataset size is comparable to that for BUN. The GWAS results for BUN and MBUN were very different, in spite of the strong genetic correlation between the two traits. We detected 12 QTL for MBUN, on bovine chromosomes 2, 3, 9, 11, 12, 14 and X, and one QTL for BUN on chromosome 13. The QTL detected on chromosomes 11, 14 and X overlapped with QTL detected for MUN. The GWAS results were highly sensitive to the subset of records used. Hence, caution is warranted when interpreting GWAS based on small datasets, such as for BUN. MBUN may provide an attractive alternative to perform a more powerful GWAS to detect QTL for BUN.	0
35281842	Host Genome-Metagenome Analyses Using Combinatorial Network Methods Reveal Key Metagenomic and Host Genetic Features for Methane Emission and Feed Efficiency in Cattle.	Cattle production is one of the key contributors to global warming due to methane emission, which is a by-product of converting feed stuff into milk and meat for human consumption. Rumen hosts numerous microbial communities that are involved in the digestive process, leading to notable amounts of methane emission. The key factors underlying differences in methane emission between individual animals are due to, among other factors, both specific enrichments of certain microbial communities and host genetic factors that influence the microbial abundances. The detection of such factors involves various biostatistical and bioinformatics methods. In this study, our main objective was to reanalyze a publicly available  data set using our proprietary Synomics Insights platform that is based on novel  combinatorial network and machine learning methods to detect key metagenomic and  host genetic features for methane emission and residual feed intake (RFI) in dairy cattle. The other objective was to compare the results with publicly available standard tools, such as those found in the microbiome bioinformatics platform QIIME2 and classic GWAS analysis. The data set used was publicly available and comprised 1,016 dairy cows with 16S short read sequencing data from two dairy cow breeds: Holstein and Nordic Reds. Host genomic data consisted of both 50 k and 150 k SNP arrays. Although several traits were analyzed by the original authors, here, we considered only methane emission as key phenotype for  associating microbial communities and host genetic factors. The Synomics Insights platform is based on combinatorial methods that can identify taxa that are differentially abundant between animals showing high or low methane emission or RFI. Focusing exclusively on enriched taxa, for methane emission, the study identified 26 order-level taxa that combinatorial networks reported as significantly enriched either in high or low emitters. Additionally, a Z-test on  proportions found 21/26 (81%) of these taxa were differentially enriched between  high and low emitters (p value <.05). In particular, the phylum of Proteobacteria and the order Desulfovibrionales were found enriched in high emitters while the order Veillonellales was found to be more abundant in low emitters as previously  reported for cattle (Wallace et al., 2015). In comparison, using the publicly available tool ANCOM only the order Methanosarcinales could be identified as differentially abundant between the two groups. We also investigated a link between host genome and rumen microbiome by applying our Synomics Insights platform and comparing it with an industry standard GWAS method. This resulted in the identification of genetic determinants in cows that are associated with changes in heritable components of the rumen microbiome. Only four key SNPs were  found by both our platform and GWAS, whereas the Synomics Insights platform identified 1,290 significant SNPs that were not found by GWAS. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis found transcription factor as the dominant biological function. We estimated heritability of a core 73 taxa from the original set of 150 core order-level taxonomies and showed that some species are medium to highly heritable (0.25-0.62), paving the way for selective breeding of animals with desirable core microbiome characteristics. We identified a set of 113 key SNPs associated with >90% of these core heritable taxonomies. Finally, we have characterized a small set (<10) of SNPs strongly associated with key heritable bacterial orders with known role in methanogenesis, such as Desulfobacterales and Methanobacteriales.	0
35363779	Cross-population selection signatures in Canchim composite beef cattle.	Analyses of livestock genomes have been used to detect selection signatures, which are genomic regions associated with traits under selection leading to a change in allele frequency. The objective of the present study was to characterize selection signatures in Canchim composite beef cattle using cross-population analyses with the founder Nelore and Charolais breeds. High-density single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes were available on 395 Canchim representing the target population, along with genotypes from 809 Nelore  and 897 Charolais animals representing the reference populations. Most of the selection signatures were co-located with genes whose functions agree with the expectations of the breeding programs; these genes have previously been reported  to associate with meat quality, as well as reproductive traits. Identified genes  were related to immunity, adaptation, morphology, as well as behavior, could give new perspectives for understanding the genetic architecture of Canchim. Some selection signatures identified genes that were recently introduced in Canchim, such as the loci related to the polled trait.	0
35361830	Four novel candidate causal variants for deficient homozygous haplotypes in Holstein cattle.	Mendelian variants can determine both insemination success and neonatal survival  and thus influence fertility and rearing success of cattle. We present 24 deficient homozygous haplotype regions in the Holstein population of Switzerland  and provide an overview of the previously identified haplotypes in the global Holstein breed. This study encompasses massive genotyping, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and phenotype association analyses. We performed haplotype screenings on almost 53 thousand genotyped animals including 114 k SNP data with  two different approaches. We revealed significant haplotype associations to several survival, birth and fertility traits. Within haplotype regions, we mined  WGS data of hundreds of bovine genomes for candidate causal variants, which were  subsequently evaluated by using a custom genotyping array in several thousand breeding animals. With this approach, we confirmed the known deleterious SMC2:p.Phe1135Ser missense variant associated with Holstein haplotype (HH) 3. For two previously reported deficient homozygous haplotypes that show negative associations to female fertility traits, we propose candidate causative loss-of-function variants: the HH13-related KIR2DS1:p.Gln159* nonsense variant and the HH21-related NOTCH3:p.Cys44del deletion. In addition, we propose the RIOX1:p.Ala133_Glu142del deletion as well as the PCDH15:p.Leu867Val missense variant to explain the unexpected low number of homozygous haplotype carriers for HH25 and HH35, respectively. In conclusion, we demonstrate that with mining massive SNP data in combination with WGS data, we can map several haplotype regions and unravel novel recessive protein-changing variants segregating at frequencies of 1 to 5%. Our findings both confirm previously identified loci and expand the spectrum of undesired alleles impairing reproduction success in Holstein cattle, the world's most important dairy breed.	0
35328088	Characterization of Accessible Chromatin Regions in Cattle Rumen Epithelial Tissue during Weaning.	Weaning in ruminants is characterized by the transition from a milk-based diet to a solid diet, which drives a critical gastrointestinal tract transformation. Understanding the regulatory control of this transformation during weaning can help to identify strategies to improve rumen health. This study aimed to identify regions of accessible chromatin in rumen epithelial tissue in pre- and post-weaning calves and investigate differentially accessible regions (DARs) to uncover regulatory elements in cattle rumen development using the ATAC-seq approach. A total of 126,071 peaks were identified, covering 1.15% of the cattle  genome. From these accessible regions, 2766 DARs were discovered. Gene ontology enrichment resulted in GO terms related to the cell adhesion, anchoring junction, growth, cell migration, motility, and morphogenesis. In addition, putative regulatory canonical pathways were identified (TGFβ, integrin-linked kinase, integrin signaling, and regulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition). Canonical pathways integrated with co-expression results showed that TGFβ and ILK signaling pathways play essential roles in rumen development through the regulation of cellular adhesions. In this study, DARs during weaning were identified, revealing enhancers, transcription factors, and candidate target genes that represent potential biomarkers for the bovine rumen development, which will serve as a molecular tool for rumen development studies.	0
35359668	Genome Wide Scan to Identify Potential Genomic Regions Associated With Milk Protein and Minerals in Vrindavani Cattle.	In this study, genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted for identifying significantly associated genomic regions/SNPs with milk protein and minerals in the 96 taurine-indicine crossbred (Vrindavani) cows using 50K SNP Chip. After quality control, a total of 41,427 SNPs were retained and were further analyzed using a single-SNP additive linear model. Lactation stage, parity, test day milk  yield and proportion of exotic inheritance were included as fixed effects in GWAS model. Across all traits, 13 genome-wide significant (p < 1.20 x 10-06) and 49 suggestive significant (p < 2.41 x 10-05) SNPs were identified which were located on 18 different autosomes. The strongest association for protein percentage, calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and iron (Fe) were found on BTA 18, 7, 2, 3, 14, and 2, respectively. No significant SNP was detected for manganese (Mn). Several significant SNPs identified were within or close proximity to CDH13, BHLHE40, EDIL3, HAPLN1, INHBB, USP24, ZFAT, and IKZF2 gene, respectively. Enrichment analysis of the identified candidate genes elucidated biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions involved in metal ion binding, ion transportation, transmembrane protein, and signaling pathways. This study provided a groundwork to characterize the molecular mechanism for the phenotypic variation in milk protein percentage and minerals in crossbred cattle. Further work is required on a larger sample size with fine mapping of identified QTL to validate potential candidate regions.	0
35338370	Heavy Metals Contained Within a Pb-Zn Waste Heap Exhibit Selective Association with Microbial Modules as Revealed by Network Analysis.	Heavy metal contamination is a global environmental concern due to its persistence and toxicity. To explore soil microbial interaction mechanisms and their association with heavy metals on a Pb-Zn waste heap, ecological network analysis tools were used to analyze high-throughput data in microbiology. The microbial network was divided into several modules, but heavy metals were associated with specific modules. The heavy metal-tolerant module (M2) had a more negative than positive relationship with the heavy metal-mid-tolerant modules (M1 and M3). Tight coupling between fungal and bacterial operational taxonomic units  (OTUs) within M2 was critical for module stability and heavy metal bioremediation. Additionally, members within M2 needed to form a positive relationship to cope with heavy metal contamination (As, Pb, Zn, Cu, and Cd). The study provides fundamental information for a deeper understanding of heavy metal  bioremediation mechanisms in the Pb-Zn waste heap.	0
35245764	Seasonal and geographic variations of marine litter: A comprehensive study from the island of Cyprus.	Twenty beaches located around the island of Cyprus, in the eastern Mediterranean, were identified as monitoring sites. They were monitored over four monitoring sessions from January to September 2021 to assess marine litter amounts, categories, and spatiotemporal distribution. A total of 42,499 marine litter items were collected. The average marine litter density was 0.19 items/m2. Most of the collected items were plastics, with single-use plastics being ubiquitous.  Plastic fragments >2.5 cm made a significant proportion of the plastic litter collected, particularly in the northern coasts of the island. Cigarette butts were abundant on touristic beaches, especially in the tourism period. The study identifies significant temporal and spatial variations in the abundance and distribution of marine litter, as well as variations related to waste management  or lack thereof.	0
35318070	Molecular characterization of CRBR2 fragment of TLR4 gene in association with mastitis in Vrindavani cattle.	The bovine TLR4 gene is an interesting candidate marker for mastitis resistance,  since it is involved in neutrophil migration to and from the mammary gland during mastitis. TLR4 detects pathogen ligands, such as the Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin and facilitates innate and adaptive immune responses. In the current study, a total of 130 crossbred cows (74 mastitis tolerant and 56 with clinical mastitis) kept at the Cattle and Buffalo Farm, IVRI, Izatnagar, were selected to explore the polymorphism in the co-receptor binding region 2 (CRBR2) fragment of the TLR4 gene. PCR-SSCP and sequence analysis showed two genotypes of the TLR4 gene's CRBR2 fragment, AA and AB, which were polymorphic in both the afflicted and tolerant groups. Sequencing revealed eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in allele A and ten SNPs in allele B. This genotype had no significant effect on the incidence of clinical mastitis  according to the logistic regression model. Our study found insufficient evidence linking SNP variants in the CRBR2 region of the TLR4 gene to mastitis susceptibility in crossbred cattle.	0
35285688	Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans Are De Facto Cellular Receptors for Human Papillomavirus 16 under High Serum Conditions.	Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are nonenveloped double-stranded DNA viruses that utilize heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) as initial attachment factors prior to cell entry and infection. While extensively characterized, the selective interaction between HPV and HSPGs is generally studied using standard in vitro conditions, which fail to account for the effects that media additives, such as fetal bovine serum (FBS), can have on viral binding. As environmental conditions  and growth factors associated with wound healing are thought to play a role in natural HPV infection, we sought to investigate the effects that serum or platelet extracts could have on the binding and infectivity of HPV. Here, we demonstrate that high concentrations of FBS and human serum greatly inhibit HPV16 binding, and that for FBS, this effect results from the obstruction of cell surface HSPGs by serum-derived heparin-binding proteins (HBPs). Surprisingly, we  found that under these conditions, HPV particles utilize 6O-sulfated chondroitin  sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) as initial binding receptors prior to infection. These findings were corroborated by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown experiments, as well as through a cancer cell line screen, where we identified a strong association between viral binding in high serum and the expression of chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis genes. Furthermore, HPV binding in the presence of human platelet lysate also demonstrated an increased dependance on CSPGs, suggesting a possible role for these receptor proteoglycans in active wound healing environments. Overall, this work highlights the significant influence that serum/platelet factors can have on virus binding and identifies CSPGs as alternative cell attachment receptors for HPV. IMPORTANCE Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) have previously been identified as primary attachment factors for the initial binding of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) prior to infection. Here, we demonstrate that in vitro, HPV binding to HSPGs is strongly dependent on the surrounding experimental conditions, including the concentration of fetal bovine serum (FBS). We found that high concentrations of FBS can block HSPG-binding sites and cause a dependence on 6O-sulfated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) as alternative initial viral receptors. Further, we demonstrate that use of a human-derived alternative to FBS, human platelet lysate, also occludes HSPG-dependent binding, causing a shift toward CSPGs for viral attachment. As HPV infection of basal epithelial cells is thought to occur at sites of microtrauma with exposure to high serum levels and platelet  factors, these unexpected findings highlight a possible role for CSPGs as important cellular receptors for the binding and infectivity of HPV in vivo.	0
35286911	Association of post-partum serum Ca patterns with reproduction in Holstein cows.	The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of subclinical hypocalcemia (SCHCa) patterns on reproductive performance in dairy cows. In a prospective observational study 916 cows from 9 herds were blood sampled on DIMs  1, 2, 4 and 8; Ca concentration was measured with atomic absorption and SCHCa was defined as Ca ≤ 2.09 mmol/L. Cluster analysis revealed 2 normocalcemic (NORM and  HIGH) and five hypocalcemic (SCH-1 to 5) clusters. Cows in cluster NORM (n = 151) had mean day-to-day serum Ca (DIMs 1-8) between 2.24 and 2.41 mmol/L, and cows in HIGH (n = 167) between 2.42 and 2.53 mmol/L. Cows in SCH-1 (n = 130) and SCH-2 (n = 102) had transient and mostly mild SCHCa on day 1 and day 2, respectively. Cows in SCH-3 (n = 123) had mostly severe SCHCa on days 1 and 2, extending to day 4. Cows in SCH-4 (n = 120) and SCH-5 (n = 145) had SCHCa which culminated on days 4 and 8, respectively. Information on reproductive outcomes including pregnancy status by 120 and 200 DIM and days open were retrieved from farm records. Median  (±SE) days to 1st artificial insemination (AI) until 120 DIM estimated with Kaplan-Meier analysis for cows in SCH-3, SCH-4 and SCH-5 were 100.0 ± 7.2, 109.0 ± 6.6 and 120.0 ± 3.2, respectively, and were statistically significantly higher from those in NORM and HIGH (91.0 ± 3.4 and 87 ± 3.7, respectively). Mean  days (±SE) to detected pregnancy until 200 DIM estimated with Kaplan-Meier analysis for cows in SCH-3 were 161.2 ± 4.8 and were statistically significantly  higher from those in clusters NORM and HIGH (155.5 ± 4.2 and 151.6 ± 4.3, respectively). The association of Ca clusters with the odds of detected pregnancy for the 1st insemination until 120 and 200 DIM was evaluated with Linear Mixed Models. Odds for pregnancy by 120 DIM did not differ among clusters, however, cows in clusters SCH-3 and SCH-5 had lower odds for pregnancy by 200 DIM compared to HIGH (OR = 0.55, P = 0.02, and OR = 0.49, P = 0.004, respectively). Covariate  adjusted survival curves generated by multivariable Cox proportional hazards model revealed that: a) clusters SCH-3 and SCH-5 had the highest (36% and 38%, respectively), while NORM and HIGH the lowest (16% and 17%, respectively) proportion of cows not inseminated for the 1st time by 120 DIM, b) compared to HIGH, cows in SCH-5 had a lower hazard of pregnancy by 120 DIM (HR = 0.42, P = 0.005), c) the proportion of open cows by 200 DIM for NORM and HIGH were 57%  and 47%, respectively, while for SCH-3 and SCH-5 66% and 68%, respectively, and d) compared to HIGH, SCH-3 (HR = 0.54, P = 0.008) and SCH-5 (HR = 0.50, P = 0.001) presented the lowest hazard for pregnancy by 200 DIM. In conclusion, cows that during the entire first week after calving were continuously normocalcemic had the best reproductive performance, while those of SCH-3 and SCH-5 the worst.	0
35307184	Genome-wide analysis of runs of homozygosity in Italian Mediterranean buffalo.	Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are a powerful tool to explore patterns of genomic inbreeding in animal populations and detect signatures of selection. The present  study used ROH analysis to evaluate the genome-wide patterns of homozygosity, inbreeding levels, and distribution of ROH islands using the SNP data sets from 899 Mediterranean buffaloes. A total of 42,433 ROH segments were identified, with an average of 47.20 segments per individual. The ROH comprising mostly shorter segments (1-4 Mb) accounted for approximately 72.29% of all ROH. In contrast, the larger ROH (>8 Mb) class accounted for only 7.97% of all ROH segments. Estimated  inbreeding coefficients from ROH (FROH) ranged from 0.0201 to 0.0371. Pearson correlations between FROH and genomic relationship matrix increased with the increase of ROH length. We identified ROH hotspots in 12 genomic regions, located on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, 17, and 19, harboring a total of 122 genes. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis revealed the clustering of these genes into 7 PPI networks. Many genes located in these regions were associated with different production traits. In addition, 5 ROH islands overlapped with cattle quantitative trait loci that were mainly associated with milk traits. These findings revealed the genome-wide autozygosity patterns and inbreeding levels in  Mediterranean buffalo. Our study identified many candidate genes related to production traits that could be used to assist in selective breeding for genetic  improvement of buffalo.	0
35221059	Assessment of milk yield and composition, early reproductive performance, and herd removal in multiparous dairy cattle based on the week of diagnosis of hyperketonemia in early lactation.	The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate the effects of the timing of hyperketonemia (HYK) diagnosis during early lactation on milk yield and composition, reproductive performance, and herd removal. Plasma β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) was measured twice a week during the first 2 wk of lactation in 362 multiparous Holstein cows for the diagnosis of HYK. In each week, cows were diagnosed as HYK positive (HYK+) if the plasma BHB concentrations were ≥1.2 mmol/L in at least one of the tests for the week evaluated. Milk-related outcomes (first 10 monthly milk tests) included milk yield, milk fat and protein content,  milk urea nitrogen (MUN), and linear score of somatic cell count. Other performance outcomes of interest included risk of pregnancy within 150 d in milk  (DIM) and herd removal (i.e., culling or death) within 300 DIM. Statistical models were built separately for cows diagnosed with HYK during the first week of lactation (wk1) and for cows diagnosed during the second week of lactation (wk2). All models for wk2 were adjusted by HYK diagnosed in wk1, along with other potential confounder variables. The association between HYK in each week and milk-related outcomes was assessed using generalized estimated equation models that accounted for repeated measures. Time to pregnancy and time to herd removal  were analyzed using Cox's proportional hazard regression models. Seventy-eight cows (21.5%) tested positive for HYK during wk1, 60 cows (16.6%) in wk2, and 29 cows (8.0%) in both weeks. Hyperketonemia during wk1 was associated with a milk yield reduction of 3.7 kg [95% confidence interval (CI): -6.67 to -0.76] per cow  per day throughout the lactation. Meanwhile, we did not observe evidence of an association between HYK diagnosed during wk2 and milk yield. During the first 2 monthly milk tests, cows diagnosed as HYK+ in wk1 had greater fat (0.42%; 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.67) and MUN (0.75 mg/dL; 95% CI: 0.26 to 1.24) content in milk than HYK-negative (HYK-) cows. We did not detect any evidence of an association between HYK diagnosed in wk2 and these outcomes. The HYK+ cows in wk1 had a 30% [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.48 to 1.01] lower risk of pregnancy within 150 DIM and 2.48 times (95% CI: 1.63 to 2.89) higher risk of herd removal within  300 DIM than HYK- cows. Conversely, no evidence of association was observed between HYK+ cows in wk2 and risk of pregnancy by 150 DIM (HR = 0.98; 95% CI: 0.64 to 1.51) or removal from the herd within 300 DIM (HR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.52 to 1.60). Our findings indicate that HYK diagnosed during wk1 of lactation is associated with negative performance in terms of milk yield, reproduction, and herd removal. No evidence of association was found for the same outcomes when HYK was diagnosed in wk2. Our results suggest the need to consider the timing when HYK is diagnosed when investigating its association with performance outcomes.	0
35218992	Genome-wide detection of non-additive quantitative trait loci for semen production traits in beef and dairy bulls.	Semen production traits are important aspects of bull fertility, because semen quantity leads to direct profits for artificial insemination centres, and semen quality is associated with the probability of achieving a pregnancy. Most genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for semen production traits have assumed  that each quantitative trait locus (QTL) has an additive effect. However, GWASs that account for non-additive effects are also important in fitness traits, such  as bull fertility. Here, we performed a GWAS using models that accounted for additive and non-additive effects to evaluate the importance of non-additive effects on five semen production traits in beef and dairy bulls. A total of 65 463 records for 615 Japanese Black bulls (JB) and 50 734 records for 873 Holstein bulls (HOL), which were previously genotyped using the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip, were used to estimate genetic parameters and perform GWAS. The heritability estimates were low (ranged from 0.11 to 0.23), and the repeatability estimates were low to moderate (ranged from 0.28 to 0.45) in both breeds. The estimated repeatability was approximately twice as high as the estimated heritability for all traits. In this study, only one significant region with an additive effect was detected in each breed, but multiple significant regions with non-additive effects were detected for each breed. In particular, the region at approximately 64 Mbp on Bos taurus autosome 17 had the highest significant non-additive effect on four semen production traits in HOL. The rs41843851 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the region had a much lower P-value for the non-additive effect (P-value = 1.1 × 10-31) than for the additive effect (P-value = 1.1 × 10-8) in sperm motility. The AA and AB genotypes on the SNP had  a higher phenotype than the BB genotype in HOL, and there was no bull with the BB genotype in JB. Our results showed that non-additive QTLs affect semen production traits, and a novel QTL accounting for non-additive effects could be detected by  GWAS. This study provides new insights into non-additive QTLs that affect fitness traits, such as semen production traits in beef and dairy bulls.	0
35216085	The Induced Expression of BPV E4 Gene in Equine Adult Dermal Fibroblast Cells as  a Potential Model of Skin Sarcoid-like Neoplasia.	The equine sarcoid is one of the most common neoplasias in the Equidae family. Despite the association of this tumor with the presence of bovine papillomavirus  (BPV), the molecular mechanism of this lesion has not been fully understood. The  transgenization of equine adult cutaneous fibroblast cells (ACFCs) was accomplished by nucleofection, followed by detection of molecular modifications using high-throughput NGS transcriptome sequencing. The results of the present study confirm that BPV-E4- and BPV-E1^E4-mediated nucleofection strategy significantly affected the transcriptomic alterations, leading to sarcoid-like neoplastic transformation of equine ACFCs. Furthermore, the results of the current investigation might contribute to the creation of in vitro biomedical models suitable for estimating the fates of molecular dedifferentiability and the epigenomic reprogrammability of BPV-E4 and BPV-E4^E1 transgenic equine ACFC-derived sarcoid-like cell nuclei in equine somatic cell-cloned embryos. Additionally, these in vitro models seem to be reliable for thoroughly recognizing molecular mechanisms that underlie not only oncogenic alterations in  transcriptomic signatures, but also the etiopathogenesis of epidermal and dermal  sarcoid-dependent neoplastic transformations in horses and other equids. For those reasons, the aforementioned transgenic models might be useful for devising  clinical treatments in horses afflicted with sarcoid-related neoplasia of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues.	0
35304289	Formononetin attenuates Aβ25-35-induced adhesion molecules in HBMECs via Nrf2 activation.	Brain vascular inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a central pathogenic factor in AD, the extracellular buildup of amyloid-β (Aβ) induces brain microvascular endothelial cells activation, impairs endothelial structure and function. Formononetin (FMN) has been reported to protect against Alzheimer's disease (AD) and attenuates vascular inflammation in atherosclerosis. However, its involvement in regulating vascular  inflammation of AD has not been investigated. In the study, we found that FMN significantly attenuates Aβ25-35-induced expression of adhesion molecules, including intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in the human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs),  suggesting that FMN inhibits Aβ25-35-induced brain endothelial cells inflammatory response. Moreover, we observed that FMN attenuates Aβ25-35-induced translocation of NFκB (p65) into the nucleus of HBMECs, and found that FMN treatment induces Nrf2 expression and attenuates Nrf2-Keap1 association in a dose-dependent manner  in HBMECs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Nrf2 silencing significantly attenuates FMN-reduced NFκB (p65) activation and nuclear translocation. Lastly, our results showed that FMN treatment attenuates Aβ25-35-induced adhesion of THP-1 cell to endothelial cell monolayer. Collectively, these findings suggest that FMN attenuates Aβ25-35-induced activation in human brain microvascular endothelial cells, which at least in part was mediated through Nrf2 pathways.	0
35448653	Candidate Genes in Bull Semen Production Traits: An Information Approach Review.	Semen quality plays a crucial role in the successful implementation of breeding programs, especially where artificial insemination (AI) is practiced. Bulls with  good semen traits have good fertility and can produce a volume of high semen per  ejaculation. The aim of this review is to use an information approach to highlight candidate genes and their relation to bull semen production traits. The use of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has been demonstrated to be successful in identifying genomic regions and individual variations associated with production traits. Studies have reported over 40 genes associated with semen traits using Illumina BeadChip single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs).	0
35427916	Global prevalence of Giardia duodenalis in cattle: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	Giardia duodenalis is an important intestinal parasite responsible for diarrhea in humans and animals worldwide. Up to now, G. duodenalis infections in cattle have been reported in many studies around the world. Hence, the aim of the present study is to report on the distribution of G. duodenalis in cattle at global scale and to evaluate the global prevalence, risk factors and genetic characterization of G. duodenalis infection among cattle worldwide. International databases were systematically searched to identify relevant studies. A random-effects meta-analysis model was used to estimate the overall and the subgroup-pooled prevalence of G. duodenalis across studies, and the variance between studies (heterogeneity) was quantified by I2 index. One hundred and fifty-eight articles (including 195 datasets), from 48 countries met eligibility  criteria for analysis. Considering detection methods, the pooled prevalence was estimated to be 24% (95% confidence interval (CI), 19-30%) using copro-antigen techniques, 22% (95% CI, 17-28%) using molecular, and 16% (95% CI, 12-20%) using  microscopic detection. Molecular methods showed that the highest number of reports were associated with assemblage E (45/46; 97.83% studies), assemblage A (33/46; 71.74% studies) and assemblage A+E (10/46; 21.74% studies). The pooled prevalence different of subgroups (WHO regions, countries, and type of cattle) were analyzed separately. Moreover, a significant association was observed between G. duodenalis infection with cattle suffering from diarrhea (odds ratio (OR), 2.61; 95% CI, 1.50-4.55) and pre-weaned calves (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.08-2.95). These results suggest that the corresponding control scheme and effective management measures should be formulated to reduce the transmission of  G. duodenalis infection according to the difference of geographical conditions in different areas.	0
35383222	Screening and validation of reference genes for qRT-PCR of bovine skeletal muscle-derived satellite cells.	The accuracy of sixteen commonly used internal reference genes was assessed in skeletal muscle-derived satellite cells of Qinchuan cattle at different stages of proliferation and induction of differentiation to determine the most suitable ones. Quantitative real-time PCR and three commonly used algorithmic programs, GeNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper, were used to evaluate the stability of expression of the candidate internal reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, PPIA, LRP10, HPRT1, YWHAZ, B2M, TBP, EIF3K , RPS9, UXT, 18S rRNA, RPLP0, MARVELD, EMD and RPS15A) in skeletal muscle-derived satellite cells at 0, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h of growth and after differentiation for 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 days. The expression of two satellite cell marker genes, CCNA2 and MYF5, was used for validation analysis. The results of the software analyses showed that GAPDH and RPS15A were the most stable reference gene combinations during in vitro proliferation of bovine skeletal muscle-derived satellite cells, RPS15A and RPS9 were the most stable reference gene combinations during in vitro induction of differentiation of the cells, and PPIA was the least stable reference gene during proliferation and differentiation and was not recommended. This study lays the foundation for the selection of reference genes for qRT-PCR during the proliferation and induction of differentiation of bovine skeletal muscle-derived satellite cells.	0
35451781	Incorporation of Trait-Specific Genetic Information into Genomic Prediction Models.	Due to the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technology, we can easily obtain not only the genetic variants at the whole-genome sequence level (e.g., from 1000 Genomes project and 1000 Bull Genomes project), but also a wide  range of functional annotations (e.g., enhancers and promoters from ENCODE, FAANG, and FarmGTEx projects) across a wide range of tissues, cell types, developmental stages, and environmental conditions. This huge amount of information leads to a revolution in studying genetics and genomics of complex traits in humans, livestock, and plant species. In this chapter, we focused on and reviewed the genomic prediction methods that incorporate external biological  information into genomic prediction, such as sequence ontology, linkage disequilibrium (LD) of SNPs, quantitative trait loci (QTL), and multi-layer omics data (e.g., transcriptome, epigenome, and microbiome).	0
35352252	Association of Infradian Rhythms of Motor Activity, Concentration of Glucocorticoid Hormones, and One-Minute-Step Oscillations of Body Temperature with Intensity of Fluctuations of Secondary Cosmic Rays.	The study compared the daily mean intensity of one-minute-step fluctuations in intensity of the secondary cosmic rays reflected by neutron count rate and dynamics of body temperature, motor activity, as well as concentration of glucocorticoid hormones in birds and rodents. A positive correlation was established between body temperature oscillations and neutron count rate fluctuations. A similar correlation was observed between physical parameter (neutron count rate), on the one hand, and daily mean motor activity and concentration of glucocorticoid hormones in the animals. The periods and phases of these processes presented in synchronous time series coincided. The facts of simultaneous variations or disturbances of the periods in dynamics of biological  and physical parameters attest to their relationships. The study concluded that the infradian rhythms with the periods of 3-5 days depend on some external environmental factor related to fluctuations in intensity of secondary cosmic rays.	0
35301378	Breed dependent regulatory mechanisms of beneficial and non-beneficial fatty acid profiles in subcutaneous adipose tissue in cattle with divergent feed efficiency.	The current study aimed to determine whether breed and feed efficiency affect the molecular mechanisms regulating beneficial and non-beneficial fatty acid profiles in subcutaneous adipose tissue of beef steers. Fatty acid profiling and RNA-Seq based transcriptome analysis were performed on subcutaneous adipose tissues collected from beef steers with three divergent breeds (Angus, ANG, n = 47; Charolais, CHAR, n = 48; Kinsella Composite, KC, n = 48) and different residual feed intake (RFI, a measure of feed efficiency). The comparison of fatty acid profiles showed that KC had higher beneficial FAs compared to the other two breeds. Distinct FA profiles between H-RFIfat and L-RFIfat steers was more obvious for KC steers, where H-RFIfat steers tended to have higher proportion of  healthy FAs and lower proportion of the unhealthy FAs. A higher number of differentially expressed (DE) genes were observed for KC steers, whereas ANG and  CHAR steers had a lower number of DE genes between H- and L-RFIfat steers. The association analyses of the gene expressions and FA profiles showed that 10 FA metabolism-associated genes together with the one upstream regulator (SREBF1) were associated with the proportion of C18:2n-6, total n-6, PUFA and PUFA/SFA for KC steers but not the other two breeds. Subcutaneous adipose tissue FA profiles and healthy FA index differed in cattle with divergent feed efficiency and such variation was unique for the three examined cattle breeds. Key FA metabolism-associated genes together with SREBF1 which is the upstream regulator  of a set of genes involved in lipid metabolism may be of importance for genetic selection of meat with higher healthy FA index in beef cattle.	0
35214793	Protection of Cattle against Epizootic Bovine Abortion (EBA) Using a Live Pajaroellobacter abortibovis Vaccine.	Epizootic bovine abortion (EBA) is an arthropod-borne bacterial disease that causes significant economic loss for cattle producers in the western United States. The etiologic agent, Pajaroellobacter abortibovis, is an intracellular pathogen that has yet to be cultivated in vitro, thereby requiring novel methodologies for vaccine development. A vaccine candidate, using live P. abortibovis-infected cells (P.a-LIC) harvested from mouse spleens, was tested in  beef cattle. Over the course of two safety studies and four efficacy trials, safety risks were evaluated, and dosage and potencies refined. No incidence of anaphylaxis, recognized health issues or significant impact upon conception rates were noted. Vaccination did result in subclinical skin reactions. Early fetal losses were noted in two trials and were significant when the vaccine was administered within 21 days prior to conception. Administration of the EBA agent  (EBAA) vaccine as a single dose, at a potency of 500 P.a-LIC, 56 days prior to breeding, provided 100% protection with no early fetal losses. Seroconversion occurred in all animals following EBAA vaccination and corresponded well with protection of the fetus from epizootic bovine abortion.	0
35358837	Estimating the burden of multiple endemic diseases and health conditions using Bayes' Theorem: A conditional probability model applied to UK dairy cattle.	The Global Burden of Animal Diseases (GBADs) is an international collaboration aiming, in part, to measure and improve societal outcomes from livestock. One GBADs objective is to estimate the economic impact of endemic diseases in livestock. However, if individual disease impact estimates are linearly aggregated without consideration for associations among diseases, there is the potential to double count impacts, overestimating the total burden. Accordingly,  the authors propose a method to adjust an array of individual disease impact estimates so that they may be aggregated without overlap. Using Bayes' Theorem, conditional probabilities were derived from inter-disease odds ratios in the literature. These conditional probabilities were used to calculate the excess probability of disease among animals with associated conditions, or the probability of disease overlap given the odds of coinfection, which were then used to adjust disease impact estimates so that they may be aggregated. The aggregate impacts, or the yield, fertility, and mortality gaps due to disease, were then attributed and valued, generating disease-specific losses. The approach was illustrated using an example dairy cattle system with input values and supporting parameters from the UK, with 13 diseases and health conditions endemic to UK dairy cattle: cystic ovary, disease caused by gastrointestinal nematodes, displaced abomasum, dystocia, fasciolosis, lameness, mastitis, metritis, milk fever, neosporosis, paratuberculosis, retained placenta, and subclinical ketosis. The diseases and conditions modelled resulted in total adjusted losses of £ 404/cow/year, equivalent to herd-level losses of £ 60,000/year. Unadjusted aggregation methods suggested losses 14-61% greater. Although lameness was identified as the costliest condition (28% of total losses), variations in the prevalence of fasciolosis, neosporosis, and paratuberculosis (only a combined 22% of total losses) were nearly as impactful individually as variations in the prevalence of lameness. The results suggest that from a disease control policy perspective, the costliness of a disease may not always be the best indicator of  the investment its control warrants; the costliness rankings varied across approaches and total losses were found to be surprisingly sensitive to variations in the prevalence of relatively uncostly diseases. This approach allows for disease impact estimates to be aggregated without double counting. It can be applied to any livestock system in any region with any set of endemic diseases, and can be updated as new prevalence, impact, and disease association data become available. This approach also provides researchers and policymakers an alternative tool to rank prevention priorities.	0
35396568	Integrated analysis of expression profiles with meat quality traits in cattle.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a vital role in improving meat quality by binding to messenger RNAs (mRNAs). We performed an integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression profiling between bulls and steers based on the differences in meat quality traits. Fat and fatty acids are the major phenotypic indices of meat quality traits to estimate between-group variance. In the present study, 90 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEGs) and 18 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were identified. Eighty-three potential DEG targets and 18 DEMs were used  to structure a negative interaction network, and 75 matching target genes were shown in this network. Twenty-six target genes were designated as intersection genes, screened from 18 DEMs, and overlapped with the DEGs. Seventeen of these genes enriched to 19 terms involved in lipid metabolism. Subsequently, 13 DEGs and nine DEMs were validated using quantitative real-time PCR, and seven critical genes were selected to explore the influence of fat and fatty acids through hub genes and predict functional association. A dual-luciferase reporter and Western  blot assays confirmed a predicted miRNA target (bta-miR-409a and PLIN5). These findings provide substantial evidence for molecular genetic controls and interaction among genes in cattle.	0
35308836	Estimation of direct and maternal genetic effects and annotation of potential candidate genes for weight and meat quality traits in a genotyped outdoor dual-purpose cattle breed.	With regard to potential applications of genomic selection in small numbered breeds, we evaluated genomic models and focused on potential candidate gene annotations for weight and meat quality traits in the local Rotes Höhenvieh (RHV) breed. Traits included 6,003 birth weights (BWT), 5,719 200 d-weights (200dw), 4,594 365 d-weights (365dw), and 547 records for intramuscular fat content (IMF). A total of 581,304 SNP from 370 genotyped cattle with phenotypic records were included in genomic analyses. Model evaluations focused on single- and multiple-trait models with direct and with direct and maternal genetic effects. Genetic relationship matrices were based on pedigree (A-matrix), SNP markers (G-matrix), or both (H-matrix). Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) were carried out using linear mixed models to identify potential candidate genes for the traits of interest. De-regressed proofs (DRP) for direct and maternal genetic components were used as pseudo-phenotypes in the GWAS. Accuracies of direct breeding values were higher from models based on G or on H compared to A. Highest accuracies (> 0.89) were obtained for IMF with multiple-trait models using the G-matrix. Direct heritabilities with maternal genetic effects ranged from 0.62 to 0.66 for BWT, from 0.45 to 0.55 for 200dW, from 0.40 to 0.44 for 365dW, and from  0.48 to 0.75 for IMF. Maternal heritabilities for BWT, 200dW, and 365dW were in a narrow range from 0.21 to 0.24, 0.24 to 0.27, and 0.21 to 0.25, respectively, and from 0.25 to 0.65 for IMF. Direct genetic correlations among body weight traits were positive and favorable, and very similar from different models but showed a  stronger variation with 0.31 (A), -0.13 (G), and 0.45 (H) between BWT and IMF. In gene annotations, we identified 6, 3, 1, and 6 potential candidate genes for direct genetic effect on BWT, 200dW, 365dW, and IMF traits, respectively. Regarding maternal genetic effects, four (SHROOM3, ZNF609, PECAM1, and TEX2) and  two (TMEM182 and SEC11A) genes were detected as potential candidate genes for BWT and 365dW, respectively. Potential candidate genes for maternal effect on IMF were GRHL2, FGA, FGB, and CTNNA3. As the most important finding from a practical  breeding perspective, a small number of genotyped RHV cattle enabled accurate breeding values for high heritability IMF.	0
35285243	A Metagenomic Approach for Characterizing Antibiotic Resistance Genes in Specific Bacterial Populations: Demonstration with Escherichia coli in Cattle Manure.	The high diversity of bacterial antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and the different health risks due to their association with different bacterial hosts require environmental ARG risk assessment to have capabilities of both high throughput and host differentiation. Current whole genome sequencing of cultivated isolates is low in throughput, while direct metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) of environmental samples is nonselective with respect to bacterial hosts. This study introduced a population metagenomic approach that combines isolate library construction and mNGS of the population metagenomic DNA, which enables studying ARGs and their association with mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in a specific bacterial population. The population metagenomic approach was demonstrated with the E. coli population in cattle manure, which detected the co-location of multiple ARGs on the same MGEs and their correspondence to the prevalence of resistance phenotypes of the E. coli isolates. When compared with direct mNGS of the cattle manure samples, the E. coli population metagenomes exhibited a significantly different resistome and an  overall higher relative abundance of ARGs and horizontal gene transfer risks. IMPORTANCE Bacterial antibiotic resistance genes in the environment are ubiquitous and can pose different levels of human health risks due to their bacterial host association and subsequent mobility. This study introduced a population metagenomic approach to study ARGs and their mobility in specific bacterial populations through a combination of selective cultivation followed by  next generation sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of the combined metagenome  of isolates. The utility of this approach was demonstrated with the E. coli population in cattle manure samples, which showed that ARGs detected in the E. coli population corresponded to the observed resistance phenotypes, co-location of multiple ARGs on the same mobile genetic elements.	0
35392112	An Observational Study Investigating Potential Risk Factors and Economic Impact for Bovine Ischaemic Teat Necrosis on Dairy Farms in Great Britain.	Bovine ischaemic teat necrosis (ITN) is an emerging disease of unknown aetiology  that affects the teats of dairy cattle. It causes economic and animal welfare issues with many animals being culled. No effective treatments or epidemiological data to inform control strategies are currently available. The aim of this observational study was to investigate farmer-reported experiences and identify potential farm-level risk factors. In January 2018, a questionnaire was sent to a random sample of 1,855 Great Britain (GB) dairy farmers. A usable response rate of 12.3% was obtained. Fifty-one per cent [95% confidence interval (CI): 44.4-57.8%] of farmers reported having experienced ITN on their farm between 1985 and 2018. Rising numbers of farms indicated that ITN is an emerging disease with  46.3% of farmers reporting the first case in the 3 years up to 2018. At the animal level, 47.3% (95% CI: 38.7-55.9%) of the cases occurred during the first lactation and 78.9% (95% CI: 75.2-82.6%) within the first 90 days in milk. Only 20.8% (95% CI: 15.9-26.4%) of the cases were reported to recover, whereas 22.8% (95% CI: 17.8-28.5%) of the cases required culling. The remaining cases experienced complications such as loss of a teat and/or mastitis. From these data, the cost of ITN, through production losses and expenditure, was estimated to be £1,121 per farm per year. The costs were estimated at £720, £860 and £2,133 for recovered, complicated and culled cases, respectively. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to explore the associations between the presence of ITN on farm and various risk factors. The presence of udder cleft dermatitis (UCD) (odds ratio 2.80; 95% CI: 1.54-5.07; p < 0.01) and chapped teats (odds ratio 6.07; 95% CI: 1.96-18.76; p < 0.01) in the milking herd was associated with the presence of ITN at the farm level. This is the first national questionnaire of ITN within GB and highlights the association of UCD and chapped teats with ITN at the farm level. While there are many limitations and potential bias around farmer questionnaires, these findings highlight several key areas for further disease investigation and possible intervention.	0
35261542	Association of inflammatory biomarker abnormalities with mortality in COVID-19: a meta-analysis.	Background: COVID-19 outbreak has engulfed different parts of the world, affecting more than 163 million people and causing more than 3 million deaths worldwide due to human transmission. Thus, it has become critical to identify the risk factors and laboratory parameters to identify patients who have high chances of worsening clinical symptoms or poor clinical outcomes. Therefore, the study aims to identify inflammatory markers that can help identify patients at increased risk for progression to critical illness, thus decreasing the risk of any mortality. Our study focussed on the predictive utility of C-reactive protein, Interleukin-6, D-dimer and Procalcitonin in assisting the management of  COVID-19 patients with adverse clinical effects. Through literature search in electronic databases, we included the retrospective studies that evaluated the biomarkers among confirmed COVID-19 patients before initiation of treatment and who had a definite outcome (dead or discharged). Biomarkers were expressed in standardized difference in mean value, calculated based on study sizes and mean values between survivors and non-survivors considered the effect size. We carried out a meta-regression analysis to identify the causes of the heterogeneity between the studies. Results: Number of studies eligible for C-reactive protein, D-dimer and Interleukin-6 markers were eight, seven and four, respectively. Using random effect model revealed that the overall effect size with 95% confidence interval (CI) for C-reactive protein, D-dimer and Interleukin-6 were 1.45 (0.79-2.12) milligrams/litre, 1.12 (0.64-1.59) micrograms/millilitre Fibrinogen Equivalent Units and 1.34 (0.43-2.24) picograms/millilitre respectively was statistically significant (P < 0.05) inferring that the mean scores of these marker were significantly higher among the non-survivors compared to the survivors. Two studies were eligible for Procalcitonin marker and there was no heterogeniety (I  2-statistics = 0) between these studies. Therefore, fixed-effect model revealed that the overall effect size (95% CI) for Procalcitonin was 0.75 (0.30-1.21) Nanograms/millilitre was also high among non-survivors. Conclusions: The study found that serum levels of C-reactive protein, Interleukin-6 and D-dimer showed significant elevation in non-survivors compared  to survivors. Raised inflammatory markers aid in the risk stratification of COVID-19 patients and their proper management.	0
35327098	The Estimation of Genetic Parameters for Longevity According to Lactation Period  Using a Multiple Trait Animal Model in Korean Holstein Cows.	Longevity is closely related to the survival rate of dairy cattle and refers to the period during which the cow has economic value, from first calving to culling. The purpose of this study was to analyze the culling patterns and survival rates of Korean Holstein cows and evaluate genetic characteristics related to parity and longevity of each lactation by using the test day milk yield collected in South Korea. The performance data of the dairy cattle were collected from 2004 to 2019 by the Nonghyup Dairy Cattle Improvement Center. The  collected 1,702,304 records were used as pedigree data through the Korea Animal Improvement Association. The lactation period was divided into early-lactation (0-90 days: L1.1, L2.1, and L3.1), mid-lactation (91-299 days: L1.2, L2.2, and L3.2), and late-lactation (300 days-next parity: L1.3, L2.3, and L3.3). The heritability of longevity for the first, second, and third parity was 0.020, 0.028, and 0.039, respectively. In all parities, the heritability in late-lactation was higher than that in early- and mid-lactation. Most genetic correlations for survival in the first parity were higher than those in the second and third parities. The results of this study may serve as a basis for developing a more accurate model for evaluating longevity traits in South Korea.	0
35456104	Diagnosis of Coxiella burnetii Cattle Abortion: A One-Year Observational Study.	Q fever is a zoonosis occurring worldwide in livestock. Often neglected in differential diagnoses, Q fever can persist in herds causing financial losses. In ruminants, well-known manifestations of Q fever are metritis, infertility, abortion, stillbirth and delivery of a weak or premature calf. In cattle, Q fever is frequently asymptomatic and/or under-reported. Few studies are available on the diagnosis of Coxiella burnetii as a cause of abortion in cattle using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for pathogen detection while enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is used to assess exposure. Moreover, existing studies include a relatively small number of abortions. The aim of this study is  to assess, in the southern part of Belgium, during a year, the performance of diagnosis of C. burnetii as a cause of abortion and the putative benefit of enhanced serology using anamnesis (animal patient data, and present, past and environmental history). A one-year random selection of 1212 abortions was analysed both with the PCR method (tissues from fetuses) and two commercialised ELISAs (sera from the mothers). Relative sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA tests were assessed using PCR as the reference test. The prevalence of C. burnetii PCR positive was 8.5% (95% CI: 6.99-10.21). The diagnostic value of the  ELISA tests was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). The sensitivity, specificity and AUC-ROC were similar for both ELISA tests. The diagnostic capacity of the ELISA was confirmed  and slightly enhanced if anamnestic information was integrated with a unique scoring index system. A high negative predictive value was demonstrated and a significant reverse association between Ct values and a percentage of the ratio of the optical density between the sample and the positive control (ELISA A or ELISA B) enabling the use of ELISA as an exclusion diagnostic. This study is original by integrating the serological result and the anamnesis in a single index. It opens a new window in enhanced veterinary clinical decision-making.	0
35328663	Molecular Properties of Human Guanylate Cyclase-Activating Protein 3 (GCAP3) and  Its Possible Association with Retinitis Pigmentosa.	The cone-specific guanylate cyclase-activating protein 3 (GCAP3), encoded by the  GUCA1C gene, has been shown to regulate the enzymatic activity of membrane-bound  guanylate cyclases (GCs) in bovine and teleost fish photoreceptors, to an extent  comparable to that of the paralog protein GCAP1. To date, the molecular mechanisms underlying GCAP3 function remain largely unexplored. In this work, we  report a thorough characterization of the biochemical and biophysical properties  of human GCAP3, moreover, we identified an isolated case of retinitis pigmentosa, in which a patient carried the c.301G&gt;C mutation in GUCA1C, resulting in the substitution of a highly conserved aspartate residue by a histidine (p.(D101H)).  We found that myristoylated GCAP3 can activate GC1 with a similar Ca2+-dependent  profile, but significantly less efficiently than GCAP1. The non-myristoylated form did not induce appreciable regulation of GC1, nor did the p.D101H variant. GCAP3 forms dimers under physiological conditions, but at odds with its paralogs, it tends to form temperature-dependent aggregates driven by hydrophobic interactions. The peculiar properties of GCAP3 were confirmed by 2 ms molecular dynamics simulations, which for the p.D101H variant highlighted a very high structural flexibility and a clear tendency to lose the binding of a Ca2+ ion to  EF3. Overall, our data show that GCAP3 has unusual biochemical properties, which  make the protein significantly different from GCAP1 and GCAP2. Moreover, the newly identified point mutation resulting in a substantially unfunctional protein could trigger retinitis pigmentosa through a currently unknown mechanism.	0
35307176	Genome-wide association analysis for susceptibility to infection by Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis in US Holsteins.	Paratuberculosis, or Johne's disease, is a chronic, granulomatous, gastrointestinal tract disease of cattle and other ruminants caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP). Control of Johne's disease is based on programs of testing and culling animals positive for  infection with MAP and concurrently modifying management to reduce the likelihood of infection. The current study was motivated by the hypothesis that genetic variation in host susceptibility to MAP infection can be dissected and quantifiable associations with genetic markers identified. Two separate GWAS analyses were conducted, the first using 897 genotyped Holstein artificial insemination sires with phenotypes derived from incidence of MAP infection among  daughters based on milk ELISA testing records. The second GWAS analysis was a case-control design using US Holstein cows phenotyped for MAP infection by serum  ELISA or fecal culture tests. Cases included cows positive for either serum ELISA, fecal culture, or both. Controls consisted of animals negative for all tests conducted. A total of 376 samples (70 cases and 306 controls) from a University of Minnesota Johne's management demonstration project and 184 samples  (76 cases and 108 controls) from a Michigan State University study were used. Medium-density (sires) and high-density (cows) genotype data were imputed to full genome sequence for the analyses. Marker-trait associations were analyzed using the single-step (ss)GWAS procedure implemented in the BLUPF90 suite of programs.  Evidence of significant genomic contributions for susceptibility to MAP infection were observed on multiple chromosomes. Results were combined across studies in a  meta-analysis, and increased support for genomic regions on BTA7 and BTA21 were observed. Gene set enrichment analysis suggested pathways for antigen processing  and presentation, antimicrobial peptides and natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity are relevant to variation in host susceptibility to MAP infection, among others. Genomic prediction was evaluated using a 5-fold cross-validation, and moderate correlations were observed between genomic breeding value predictions and daughter averages (∼0.43 to 0.53) for MAP infection in testing data sets. These results suggest that genomic selection against susceptibility to MAP infection is feasible in Holstein cattle.	0
35239048	Molecular characterization and hematological analysis of Listeria monocytogenes infection in dairy cows in Punjab (Pakistan).	Listeriosis is an emerging bacterial disease of animals and humans worldwide, caused by Listeria monocytogenes. The infected dairy cows continuously shed the microbes in their milk, a human being's concern. This study was designed to molecular characterize the Listeria monocytogenes isolated from symptomatic cow's milk of tehsils Samundri, Gujar khan, and Alipur of Punjab. A total of 175 milk samples were collected, pre-enriched and cultured on PALCAM agar. The affirmation of the hlyA gene of Listeria monocytogenes was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 3.43% of isolates were found positive. The phylogenetic analysis showed a resemblance of our isolates of Listeria monocytogenes with India (KP965733), the USA (DQ812484), and 3 of our isolates made a clade. The leucocytes and neutrophils count were found significantly increased in listeriosis affected cows. The Chi-square test showed a significant association between poor quality silage feeding and listeriosis. The presence of L.monocytogenes in cow's milk indicates a potential threat to humans. It is further recommended that it should be consistently monitored to ensure food safety.	0
35213667	Risk factors for bovine rotavirus infection and genotyping of bovine rotavirus in diarrheic calves in Bangladesh.	Bovine rotavirus (BRV) is considered the leading cause of calf diarrhea worldwide, including Bangladesh. In this study we aimed to identify risk factors  for BRV infection and determine the G and P genotypes of BRV strains in diarrheic calves. Fecal samples were collected from 200 diarrheic calves in three districts between January 2014 and October 2015. These samples were screened to detect the  presence of BRV using rapid test-strips BIO K 152 (RTSBK). The RTSBK positive samples were further tested by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the silver  staining technique to detect rotavirus dsRNA. Risk factors were identified by multivariable logistic regression analysis. The G and P genotypes of BRV were determined by RT-PCR and sequencing. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the neighbor-joining method using CLC sequence viewer 8.0. About 23% of the diarrheic calves were BRV positive. The odds of BRV infection were 3.8- (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.0-14.7) and 3.9-times (95% CI:1.1-14.2) higher in Barisal and Madaripur districts, respectively, than Sirrajganj. The risk of BRV infection was 3.1-times (95% CI: 1.5-6.5) higher in calves aged ≤ 5 weeks than those aged >5 weeks. Moreover, the risk of BRV infection was 2.6-times (95% CI:1.1-5.8) higher in crossbred (Holstein Friesian, Shahiwal) than indigenous calves. G6P[11] was the predominant genotype (94.4%), followed by G10P[11] (5.6%). The BRV G6 strains were found to be closest (98.9-99.9%) to Indian strains, and BRV G10 strains showed 99.9% identities with Indian strain. The VP4  gene of all P[11] strains showed >90% identities to each other and also with Indian strains. The most frequently identified BRV genotype was G6P[11]. About 23% of calf diarrhea cases were associated with BRV. To control disease, high-risk areas and younger crossbred calves should be targeted for surveillance  and management. The predominant genotype could be utilized as the future vaccine  candidate or vaccines with the dominant genotype should be used to control BRV diarrhea in Bangladesh.	0
35379456	Effect of selective dry cow treatment on udder health and antimicrobial usage on  Dutch dairy farms.	Since 2013, selective dry cow treatment (SDCT) has been the standard approach in  the Netherlands where farmers select cows for the use of antimicrobials at drying-off. Shortly after its introduction, antimicrobial usage decreased significantly, and no significant association was found between the level of SDCT and clinical mastitis (CM). Obviously, at that time long-term associations could  not be evaluated. This study aimed to provide insight into the methods and level  of implementation of SDCT on Dutch dairy farms with a conventional milking system (CMS) or an automatic milking system (AMS) in 2016 and 2017, several years after  the implementation of SDCT. Udder health and antimicrobial use were also assessed. For this study, 262 farmers recorded dry cow treatments as well as all  CM cases in the period from May 1, 2016, until April 30, 2017. Additionally, somatic cell count (SCC) data on cow and herd level, treatment data on herd level and questionnaire results on udder health management were collected. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics with differences between milking systems being evaluated using nonparametric univariable statistics. In the study period,  SDCT was applied on almost all (98.8%) of the participating dairy farms. The main reason for applying antimicrobials at drying-off was either the SCC history during the complete previous lactation or the SCC at the last milk recording before drying-off. The median percentage of cows treated with antimicrobials was  48.5%. The average incidence rate of CM was 27.3 cases per 100 cows per year. From all CM cases that were registered per herd, on average 32.8% were scored as  mild, 42.2% as moderate, and 25.0% as severe CM. The mean bulk tank SCC of the herds was 168,989 cells/mL. A cow was considered to have subclinical mastitis (SCM) if individual SCC was ≥150,000 cells/mL for primiparous and ≥250,000 cells/mL for multiparous cows. Passing these threshold values after 2 earlier low SCC values was considered a new case of SCM. The mean incidence rate of SCM in these herds was 62.5 cases per 100 cows per year. Bulk tank SCC and the incidence rate of SCM on farms with a CMS were statistically lower than on farms with an AMS, whereas the incidence rate of CM did not significantly differ between both groups of farms. The AMS farms had more cows per herd treated with antimicrobials at drying-off and a larger proportion of severe CM cases than did CMS farms. It is unknown whether the differences are due to the milking system or to other differences between both types of farms. This study showed the level of adoption  of SDCT, udder health, and antimicrobial usage parameters several years after the ban on the preventive use of antimicrobials in animal husbandry. It found that udder health parameters did not differ from those found in Dutch studies before and around the time of implementing SDCT, whereas SDCT was widely applied on Dutch dairy farms during the study period. Therefore, it was concluded that Dutch dairy farmers were able to handle the changed policy of antimicrobial use at drying-off while maintaining indicators of a good udder health.	0
35456078	The Associated Decision and Management Factors on Cattle Tick Level of Infestation in Two Tropical Areas of Ecuador.	Decision-making on tick control practices is linked to the level of knowledge about livestock farming and to the social context in which individuals practice them. Tick infestation is one of the main problems in tropical livestock production. The objective of this study was to characterize tick-control related  practices in two tropical livestock areas and their potential association with the level of tick infestation. A total of 139 farms were included in this survey. To determine this association, a multivariate logistic regression model was used. A stepwise model selection procedure was used and model validation was tested. Cattle husbandry as a main activity, the use of external paddocks, the use of amitraz, and the lack of mechanization on the farm were related with high tick infestation. On the other hand, owner involvement in the preparation of acaricide solution was identified as a protective factor against high tick infestation. At  animal level, age (old), body condition status (thin), and lactation were also associated with high tick infestations, while Bos primigenius indicus cattle and  their crosses reduced the probability of high tick infestations. The factors studied, such as herd size, education level of the owners, and veterinary guidance, varied from farm to farm. Nonetheless, these differences did not generate changes in the level of tick infestation. According to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), the model at farm level predicts a high level of infestation, with an accuracy of 72.00% and high sensitivity. In addition, at animal level, crossbreeding with indicus cattle and  breeding selection for host resistance will be useful against high tick infestation. Likewise, the implementation of programs of capacitation and research on tick control for farmers, cowboys, and vets in these areas is necessary.	0
35255804	A 1-bp deletion in bovine QRICH2 causes low sperm count and immotile sperm with multiple morphological abnormalities.	BACKGROUND: Semen quality and insemination success are monitored in artificial insemination bulls to ensure high male fertility rates. Only ejaculates that fulfill minimum quality requirements are processed and eventually used for artificial inseminations. We examined 70,990 ejaculates from 1343 Brown Swiss bulls to identify bulls from which all ejaculates were rejected due to low semen  quality. This procedure identified a bull that produced 12 ejaculates with an aberrantly small number of sperm (0.2 ± 0.2 × 109 sperm per mL) which were mostly immotile due to multiple morphological abnormalities. RESULTS: The genome of this bull was sequenced at a 12× coverage to investigate a possible genetic cause. Comparing the sequence variant genotypes of this bull with those from 397 fertile bulls revealed a 1-bp deletion in the coding sequence of the QRICH2 gene which encodes the glutamine rich 2 protein, as a compelling candidate causal variant. This 1-bp deletion causes a frameshift in translation and a premature termination codon (ENSBTAP00000018337.1:p.Cys1644AlafsTer52). The analysis of testis transcriptomes from 76 bulls showed that the transcript with the premature termination codon is subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The 1-bp deletion resides in a 675-kb haplotype that includes 181 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the Illumina BovineHD Bead chip. This haplotype segregates at a frequency of 5% in the Brown Swiss cattle population. Our analysis also identified another bull that carried the 1-bp deletion in the homozygous state. Semen analyses from the second bull confirmed low sperm concentration and immotile sperm with multiple morphological abnormalities that primarily affect the sperm flagellum and, to a lesser extent, the sperm head. CONCLUSIONS: A recessive loss-of-function allele of the bovine QRICH2 gene likely causes low sperm concentration and immotile sperm with multiple morphological abnormalities. Routine sperm analyses unambiguously identify homozygous bulls for this allele. A direct gene test can be implemented to monitor the frequency of the undesired allele in cattle populations.	0
35346467	Genetic and genomic analysis of age at first insemination in Israeli dairy cattle.	"We performed a genetic analysis of age at first insemination, including estimation of the heritability and genetic correlations with other economic traits, and the consequences of including this trait in the Israeli selection index. The genetic factors affecting age at first insemination were determined via GWAS. Five data sets were analyzed. Data sets 1, 2, and 3 were used to compute variance components among age at first insemination, first calving age, days from first insemination to calving, and the 9 traits included in the Israel  breeding index. Heritabilities for age at first insemination, calving age, and days from first insemination to calving in Israeli Holsteins as computed by REML  individual animal model analyses of 273,239 Israeli Holstein cows were 0.072, 0.042, and 0.014. The estimated genetic correlation between the first 2 traits was 0.88. In addition to the fact that heritability of age at first insemination  is 1.7 times the heritability for calving, the former trait has the advantage that the number of records is greater, and the records are generated earlier. Absolute values of the genetic and residual correlations between age at first insemination and the 9 traits included in the Israeli index were all less than 0.2. Data set 4 included first insemination dates of 1,181,600 calves born from 1985 through 2018. Genetic evaluations were computed by a single trait animal model. Annual phenotypic and genetic trends for age at first calving for calves born since 1985 were ""positive,"" that is, economically negative, at 0.320 ± 0.003 and 0.169 ± 0.005 d, respectively. Applying the GCTA-GREML software, 54% of variance in the transmitting ability of 1,585 sires could be explained by considering all 40,498 markers included in the GWAS analysis. The significant markers were mainly associated with milk production genes. The SNP UA-IFASA-8854  on chromosome 11 had the lowest probability value, 1.2 × 10-24. This marker is located between the genes RETSAT and ELMOD3, both of which are overexpressed in human mammary glands. The gene RETSAT is reported to be essential for lipid accumulation and adipogenesis promotion. Gene enrichment analysis found that genes in the genomic region flanking significant markers are associated with vasopressin receptor activity, which was shown to mediate puberty in humans. If age at first insemination is included in the index with a weighting to account for 9% of the index, reductions of 2.8 and 2.6 d for age at first insemination and first calving age after 10 yr of selection are predicted, as compared with reductions of 1.4 and 1.1 d with the current index. Gains for the other index traits are only marginally affected. We suggest selection on age at first insemination as an alternative to selection for early calving."	0
35222192	Non-symbolic Ratio Reasoning in Kindergarteners: Underlying Unidimensional Heuristics and Relations With Math Abilities.	Although it is thought that young children focus on the magnitude of the target dimension across ratio sets during binary comparison of ratios, it is unknown whether this is the default approach to ratio reasoning, or if such approach varies across representation formats (discrete entities and continuous amounts) that naturally afford different opportunities to process the dimensions in each ratio set. In the current study, 132 kindergarteners (Mage = 68 months, SD = 3.5, range = 62-75 months) performed binary comparisons of ratios with discrete and continuous representations. Results from a linear mixed model revealed that children followed an additive strategy to ratio reasoning-i.e., they focused on the magnitude of the target dimension across ratio sets as well as on the absolute magnitude of the ratio set. This approach did not vary substantially across representation formats. Results also showed an association between ratio reasoning and children's math problem-solving abilities; children with better math abilities performed better on ratio reasoning tasks and processed additional dimensions across ratio sets. Findings are discussed in terms of the processes that underlie ratio reasoning and add to the extant debate on whether true ratio  reasoning is observed in young children.	0
35327670	Identification and Characterization of Circular RNAs in Mammary Tissue from Holstein Cows at Early Lactation and Non-Lactation.	In this study, circular RNAs (circRNAs) from Holstein cow mammary tissues were identified and compared between early lactation and non-lactation. After analysis, 10,684 circRNAs were identified, ranging from 48 to 99,406 bp, and the  average size was 882 bp. The circRNAs were mainly distributed on chromosomes 1 to 11, and 89.89% of the circRNAs belonged to sense-overlapping circRNA. The exons contained with circRNAs ranged from 1 to 47 and were concentrated from 1 to 5. Compared with the non-lactating cows, 87 circRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in the peak lactation cows. There were 68 upregulated circRNAs and 19 downregulated circRNAs. Enrichment analysis of circRNAs showed that GO analysis mainly focused on immune response, triglyceride transport, T cell receptor signaling pathway, etc. Pathway analysis mainly focused on cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, T helper 17 cell differentiation, fatty acid biosynthesis, the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, etc. Specific primers were designed for two proximal ends of the circRNA junction sites to allow for PCR validation of four randomly selected circRNAs and carry out circRNA-miRNA interaction research. This study revealed the expression profile and characteristics of circRNAs in mammary tissue from Holstein cows at early lactation and non-lactation, thus providing rich information for the study of circRNA functions and mechanisms, as well as potential candidate miRNA genes for  studying lactation in Holstein cows.	0
35347868	Seroprevalence of anti-Leptospira antibodies in equines and associated workers-Isolation of Leptospira interrogans serogroup Canicola from equine urine.	To investigate seroprevalence of anti-Leptospira antibodies in equines and associated workers in Uruguay, 891 equine and 150 human sera were drawn; 212 equine urine samples were also taken for culture. Environmental conditions and equine raising or managing practices were recorded in all 72 visited establishments; epidemiological information was obtained from each worker. Microscopic agglutination technique (MAT) was performed with 10 Leptospira strains for equines and 18 for human sera, that were also studied with IgM indirect immunofluorescence (IgM-IIF). Equine titres ≥100 were considered positive, and human sera titres ≥200 suggested probable recent or past infection. Urines were cultured in Ellinghausen-McCullough-Johnson-Harris (EMJH) media; local identification of one obtained isolate with lipL32 PCR, Multiple Locus Variable number tandem repeat Analysis and partial rrs gene sequencing, were completed at Institut Pasteur, Paris. Estimated reactivity was 61.3% for equines, which was higher than the studied bovine national levels (21%) and mainly observed with Icterohaemorrhagiae serogroup (40.3%), Sejroe, Canicola, Pomona or  Ballum. Aged animals from slaughterhouses and cattle farms were the most frequently positive. Multiple regression analysis confirmed a significant association between seropositivity and equine age. Only one positive culture could be fully studied, and confirmed to be Leptospira interrogans serogroup Canicola; it was added to the MAT antigen panel and revealed fairly frequent reaction with equine and human sera. Three workers (2%) showed titres = 200 with  Icterohaemorrhagiae or Canicola serogroups, without recent clinical manifestations. Their attended equines reacted with the same serogroups, suggesting common source infections or infection transmitted by equines. Three other humans yielded titres = 100, and none of the 150 showed an IgM-IIF-positive result. Equines seem not to be an important origin of regional human leptospirosis, except perhaps during acute animal infection. More culture work is required to study intensity and lapses of leptospiruria, as well as to further identify circulating strains.	0
35413450	Whole-Genome Sequence of a Putative Pathogenic Bacillus sp. strain SD-4 Isolated  from Cattle Feed.	OBJECTIVE: The present study describes the draft genome sequence of a novel Bacillus sp. strain SD-4 isolated from animal feed. The study aims to get a deeper insight into antimicrobial resistance and secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and the association between them. METHODS: The strain SD-4 was preliminarily evaluated for antibacterial activities, motility, biofilm formation, and enterotoxin production using in vitro assays. The genome of strain SD-4 was sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform with paired-end reads. The reads were assembled and annotated using SPAdes and PGAP, respectively. The genome was further analyzed using several bioinformatics tools, including TYGS, AntiSMASH, RAST, PlasmidFinder, VFDB, VirulenceFinder, CARD, PathogenFinder, MobileElement finder, IslandViewer, and CRISPRFinder. RESULTS: In vitro assays showed that the strain is motile, synthesizes biofilm, and produces an enterotoxin and antibacterial metabolites. The genome analysis revealed that the strain SD-4 carries antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), virulence factors, as well as beneficial secondary metabolite BGCs. Further genome analysis showed interesting genome architectures containing several mobile genetic elements, including two plasmid replicons (repUS22 and rep20), five prophages, and at least four genomic islands (GIs), including one Listeria pathogenicity island LIPI-1. Moreover, the strain SD-4 is identified as a putative human pathogen. CONCLUSION: The genome of strain SD-4 harbors several BGCs coding for biologically active metabolites. It also contains antimicrobial resistance genes  and is identified as a potential human pathogen. These results can be used to better comprehend antibiotic resistance in environmental bacteria that are not influenced by human intervention.	0
35458653	A Disposable Sensor Chip Using a Paste Electrode with Surface-Imprinted Graphite  Particles for Rapid and Reagentless Monitoring of Theophylline.	This work focuses on a carbon-based imprinted polymer composite, employed as a molecular recognition and sensing interface in fabricating a disposable electrochemical sensor. The carbon-paste electrode was made of a molecularly imprinted polymer comprising a copolymer of methacrylic acid as the functional monomer and blended crosslinking monomers of N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide, and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, with theophylline as the template. The analytical properties of the proposed theophylline sensor were investigated, and the findings revealed an increase in differential pulse voltammetric current compared to the non-imprinted electrode. Under optimized conditions, the sensor has shown  high sensitivity, high selectivity, lower detection limit (2.5 µg/mL), and satisfactory long-term stability. Further, the sensor was tested in whole bovine  blood and validated without any matrix effect and cross-reactivity. Additionally, chronoamperometry of the sensor chip supported a rapid determination of THO with  a short response time of 3 s. This carbon-paste electrode is highly specific for  theophylline and may be applied as a drug sensor for clinical use.	0
35213644	Dynamic sustainable productivity growth of Dutch dairy farming.	The economic, environmental and social sustainability of Dutch dairy farms have attracted increasing societal concern in the past decades. In this paper, we propose a recently developed dynamic Luenberger indicator based on the by-production model to measure dynamic productivity growth in the economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainability of Dutch dairy farms. Subsequently, we investigate the statistical associations between productivity growth and socio-economic factors using the OLS bootstrap regression model. We find that dairy farms have suffered a decline in dynamic sustainable productivity growth, especially in the environmental dimension where it is more pronounced than in the economic and social dimensions. Furthermore, we find that both technical and scale inefficiency change contribute to the decline of environmental productivity growth. Specialization and government support are associated with a higher economic and environmental sustainability productivity growth, and with, a decreased growth of social sustainable productivity. We found no significant association between the age of the oldest entrepreneur, financial  structure, farm size or cost of advisory service and dynamic productivity growth  in the three sustainability dimensions. The results provide insights into potential pathways towards improving the three pillars of sustainability.	0
35268150	The Candidate Chromosomal Regions Responsible for Milk Yield of Cow: A GWAS Meta-Analysis.	Milk yield (MY) is highly heritable and an economically important trait in dairy  livestock species. To increase power to detect candidate genomic regions for this trait, we carried out a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS).  In the present study, we identified 19 studies in PubMed for the meta-analysis. After review of the studies, 16 studies passed the filters for meta-analysis, and the number of chromosomes, detected markers and their positions, number of animals, and p-values were extracted from these studies and recorded. The final data set based on 16 GWAS studies had 353,698 cows and 3950 markers and was analyzed using METAL software. Our findings revealed 1712 significant (p-value &lt; 2.5 × 10-6) genomic loci related to MY, with markers associated with MY found on all autosomes and sex chromosomes and the majority of them found on chromosome 14. Furthermore, gene ontology (GO) annotation was used to explore biological functions of the genes associated with MY; therefore, different regions of this chromosome may be suitable as genomic regions for further research into gene expression.	0
35244319	The prevalence of Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli in Norwegian dairy cattle farms: A comparison between free stall and tie stall housing systems.	AIMS: This study explored how dairy farm operating systems with free-stall or tie-stall housing and cow hygiene score influence the occurrence of zoonotic bacteria in raw milk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Samples from bulk tank milk (BTM), milk filters, faeces, feed, teats and teat milk were collected from 11 farms with loose housing and seven farms with tie-stall housing every second month over a period of 11 months  and analysed for the presence of STEC by culturing combined with polymerase chain reaction and for Campylobacter spp. and L. monocytogenes by culturing only. Campylobacter spp., L. monocytogenes and STEC were present in samples from the farm environment and were also detected in 4%, 13% and 7% of the milk filters, respectively, and in 3%, 0% and 1% of BTM samples. Four STEC isolates carried the eae gene, which is linked to the capacity to cause severe human disease. L. monocytogenes were detected more frequently in loose housing herds compared with  tie-stalled herds in faeces (p = 0.02) and feed (p = 0.03), and Campylobacter spp. were detected more frequently in loose housing herds in faeces (p < 0.01) and teat swabs (p = 0.03). An association between cow hygiene score and detection of Campylobacter spp. in teat milk was observed (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Since some samples collected from loose housing systems revealed a significantly higher (p < 0.05) content of L. monocytogenes and Campylobacter spp. than samples collected from tie-stalled herds, the current study suggests that the type of housing system may influence the food safety of raw milk. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study highlights that zoonotic bacteria can be present in raw milk independent of hygienic conditions at the farm and what housing system is used. Altogether, this study provides important knowledge for evaluating the risk of drinking unpasteurized milk.	0
35366068	Livestock Use on Public Lands in the Western USA Exacerbates Climate Change: Implications for Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation.	"Public lands of the USA can play an important role in addressing the climate crisis. About 85% of public lands in the western USA are grazed by domestic livestock, and they influence climate change in three profound ways: (1) they are significant sources of greenhouse gases through enteric fermentation and manure deposition; (2) they defoliate native plants, trample vegetation and soils, and accelerate the spread of exotic species resulting in a shift in landscape function from carbon sinks to sources of greenhouse gases; and (3) they exacerbate the effects of climate change on ecosystems by creating warmer and drier conditions. On public lands one cow-calf pair grazing for one month (an ""animal unit month"" or ""AUM"") produces 875 kg CO2e through enteric fermentation and manure deposition with a social carbon cost of nearly $36 per AUM. Over 14 million AUMs of cattle graze public lands of the western USA each year resulting  in greenhouse gas emissions of 12.4 Tg CO2e year-1. The social costs of carbon are > $500 million year-1 or approximately 26 times greater than annual grazing fees collected by managing federal agencies. These emissions and social costs do  not include the likely greater ecosystems costs from grazing impacts and associated livestock management activities that reduce biodiversity, carbon stocks and rates of carbon sequestration. Cessation of grazing would decrease greenhouse gas emissions, improve soil and water resources, and would enhance/sustain native species biodiversity thus representing an important and cost-effective adaptive approach to climate change."	0
35342200	Inflammatory Biomarker and Response to Antidepressant in Major Depressive Disorder: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	Inadequate response to antidepressant treatment, in a significant proportion of patients diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, contributes to the large burden of disability associated with the disease; thus, predicting treatment response is one of the most important challenge for clinicians who deal with depressed patients. The cytokine hypothesis of depression suggests that altered pheripheral cytokine levels are involved in the pathophysiology of depressive disorder and in modulating response to treatment. Present meta-analysis aimed to  investigate the association between cytokine levels at baseline and response to antidepressant therapies. Authors performed a systematic search of PubMed and Embase databases for studies published between 2010 and January 2021: of 3345 identified records, 31 studies met the inclusion criteria for the qualitative synthesis, whereas 19 studies were eligible for quantitative analysis. Patients who failed to respond to antidepressant had aberrant inflammatory process, namely higher baseline levels of C-Reactive Protein and Interleukine-8, which is associated with treatment outcome in Major Depressive Disorder. Despite these promising results, further investigations are needed in order to replicate the data and to examine the potential role of inflammatory marker as a novel predictive tool for pharmacological treatment of depressive disorder.	0
35197999	Analysis of Upstream Regulators, Networks, and Pathways Associated With the Expression Patterns of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Candidate Genes During Fetal Ovary Development.	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a multifactorial syndrome with reproductive,  endocrine, and metabolic symptoms, affecting about 10% women of reproductive age. Pathogenesis of the syndrome is poorly understood with genetic and fetal origins  being the focus of the conundrum. Genetic predisposition of PCOS has been confirmed by candidate gene studies and Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). Recently, the expression of PCOS candidate genes across gestation has been studied in human and bovine fetal ovaries. The current study sought to identify potential upstream regulators and mechanisms associated with PCOS candidate genes. Using RNA sequencing data of bovine fetal ovaries (62-276 days, n = 19), expression of PCOS candidate genes across gestation was analysed using Partek Flow. A supervised heatmap of the expression data of all 24,889 genes across gestation was generated. Most of the PCOS genes fell into one of four clusters according to their expression patterns. Some genes correlated negatively (early genes; C8H9orf3, TOX3, FBN3, GATA4, HMGA2, and DENND1A) and others positively (late genes; FDFT1, LHCGR, AMH, FSHR, ZBTB16, and PLGRKT) with gestational age. Pathways associated with PCOS candidate genes and genes co-expressed with them were determined using Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) software as well as DAVID  Bioinformatics Resources for KEGG pathway analysis and Gene Ontology databases. Genes expressed in the early cluster were mainly involved in mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation and their upstream regulators included PTEN, ESRRG/A and MYC. Genes in the late cluster were involved in stromal expansion, cholesterol biosynthesis and steroidogenesis and their upstream regulators included TGFB1/2/3, TNF, ERBB2/3, VEGF, INSIG1, POR, and IL25. These findings provide insight into ovarian development of relevance to the origins of  PCOS, and suggest that multiple aetiological pathways might exist for the development of PCOS.	0
35314179	Influences of charge properties and hydrophobicity on the coagulation of inorganic and organic matters from water associated with starch-based coagulants.	In this work, two series of binary graft cationic starch-based coagulants (CS-DMCs and CS-DMLs) with different hydrophobicities and charge densities (CDs)  were prepared by graft copolymerization of acrylamide with 2-(methacryloyloxy)-N,N,N- trimethylethanaminium chloride and acryloyloxyethyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride, respectively, on the starch (St) backbone. Kaolin particles, sodium humate (NaHA), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were used  as the simulated sources of inorganic colloidal particles and different organic pollutants in the micropolluted turbid surface water. The influences of the CD and hydrophobicity associated with the St-based coagulants on the removal of kaolin particles, NaHA, and BSA from single, binary, and ternary pollutant aqueous systems were investigated systematically. On the basis of the apparent coagulation performance, the floc characteristics, and the zeta potentials of the supernatants after coagulation, the coagulation mechanisms associated with the structural features of the St-based coagulants and the pollutants treated were explored and discussed in detail. The St-based coagulants with a higher CD and a  stronger hydrophobicity showed better coagulation performance due to the synergistic effects of charge neutralization and hydrophobic association. The maximum efficiencies of the optimized St-based coagulant in removal of Kaolin, NaHA and BSA were 93.85%, 100% and 97.52% in their respective single pollutant systems. In addition to these simulated water samples, a real micropolluted turbid surface water tested and compared, further confirming the superiority of the hydrophobically modified cationic St-based coagulants, especially in the purification of organic pollutants in water.	0
35268066	Cow's Milk Intake and Risk of Coronary Heart Disease in Korean Postmenopausal Women.	Numerous studies have reported conflicting results associated with cow's milk intake and coronary heart disease (CHD). However, studies involving postmenopausal women are very limited. This study was therefore undertaken to identify the relationship between cow's milk intake and CHD risk in postmenopausal women, using data from the 6th period of the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2013-2015). A total of 1825 postmenopausal women, aged 50-64 years old, were included in the final analysis. The frequency of cow's milk consumption for each subject was determined using the semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, and was classified into four groups (Q1-Q4): Q1, group that did not drink milk (no milk, n = 666); Q2, 0 &lt;  frequency of milk intake per week ≤ 1 (n = 453); Q3, 1 &lt; frequency of milk intake per week ≤ 3 (n = 319); and Q4, frequency of milk intake &gt;3 times per week (n = 387). General characteristics, such as education, living area, household income, and obesity level, were compared between the four groups. Percentages of daily nutrient intake compared to the dietary reference intake for Koreans (KDRIs) were determined, and the Framingham Risk Score (FRS), atherogenic index (AI), and atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) were determined as the CHD risk indicators. Except household income, no significant difference was obtained among the four groups with respect to age, education, living area, or obesity. Compared to KDRIs, the intake ratio of calcium, phosphorus, and riboflavin were significantly higher in the Q4 group than in the Q1-Q3 groups. Blood HDL-cholesterol was significantly higher in Q4 than in Q1. The CHD risk factors FRS (%), AI, and AIP were significantly lower in the Q4 group as compared to the  other groups (CHD risk (%): Q1 9.4, Q4 8.5; AI: Q1 3.06, Q4 2.83; API: Q1 0.37, Q2 0.31, Q4 0.32). FRS was determined to be significantly and positively correlated to AI or AIP, and negatively correlated with the cow's milk intake frequency and calcium intake. In conclusion, compared to women who do not consume cow's milk, postmenopausal women who consume cow's milk frequently have a better  nutritional status of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin B12, higher HDL levels, and a lower level of CHD risk indicators, such as FRS, AI, and AIP, contributing  to decreased CHD risk in a 10-year period. Therefore, to prevent the risk of CHD  in postmenopausal women, there needs to be a greater emphasis for cow's milk consumption four or more times per week.	0
35272721	The winner takes it all: dominance of Calicophoron daubneyi (Digenea: Paramphistomidae) among flukes in Central European beef cattle.	In Europe, paramphistomosis caused by Paramphistomum spp. was historically regarded as being of minor importance. However, Calicophoron daubneyi has recently been recognized as an emerging pathogen in Europe due to its increasing  prevalence and negative impact on livestock production. In search for paramphistomid flukes, 5573 beef cattle fecal samples from 115 farms across the whole Czech Republic were examined from March 2019 to June 2021. The eggs of paramphistomid flukes were identified in 29.9% of samples. Internal transcribed spacer 2 sequences from 90 adult flukes and 125 fecal samples collected across Czech Republic confirmed C. daubneyi infection in the Czech beef cattle. Ninety mitochondrial DNA sequences obtained from adult C. daubneyi specimens revealed 13 individual haplotypes, two of them recorded for the first time. Although C. daubneyi is a new parasite in beef cattle herds in the Czechia, it clearly dominates the parasitological findings in the country's beef cattle. The common occurrence of C. daubneyi in most of the beef cattle herds indicates environmental conditions suitable also for the life cycle of Fasciola hepatica and risk of its emergence.	0
35323100	A missense mutation (rs209302038) of KRT9 gene associated with heat stress in Chinese cattle.	Type I keratin 9 encoded by the KRT9 gene serves an important special function either in the mature palmar and plantar skin tissue. The changes in skin conditions and thickening of the outer layer of the skin may be affected by environmental variables. A missense mutation rs209302038 (NC_037346.1: g.41782870 G > A) was detected in KRT9, which changing the isoleucine into valine. This study aimed to identify the frequency of allele in this locus in Chinese indigenous cattle, and analyze the connection with heat stress. Our results indicated that the frequency of allele A gradually decreases from south to north, while the frequency of G allele showed the opposite pattern. Further analysis of the association of the different genotypes with three climate factors, which showed that the genotypes (GG, GA, AA) were significantly related  to climatic conditions (p < 0.01). Therefore, we speculated that the mutation of  the rs209302038 in Chinese indigenous cattle might be a genetic marker to detect  heat stress.	0
35448519	Production of Hydroxy Fatty Acids, Precursors of γ-Hexalactone, Contributes to the Characteristic Sweet Aroma of Beef.	Aroma is an essential factor for meat quality. The meat of Japanese Black cattle  exhibits fine marbling and a rich and sweet aroma with a characteristic lactone composition. The mechanism of lactone formation associated with beef aroma has not been elucidated. In this study, we examined the precursors of γ-hexalactone,  an indicator of the sweet aroma of beef and identified the mechanism underlying γ-hexalactone production. A low-temperature vacuum system was used to prepare beef tallow from Japanese Black cattle and Holstein cattle. The odor components were identified using headspace-gas chromatography. The analysis revealed that γ-hexalactone, γ-dodecalactone, δ-tetradecalactone, and δ-hexadecalactone were present as sweet aroma components of beef tallow prepared from marbling and muscle. Since we previously reported that γ-hexalactone formation correlates with linoleic acid content in beef, we analyzed ten oxidized fatty acids derived from  linoleic acid by liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry and detected two hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids (9S-HODE and 13S-HODE) in beef tallow. Significant differences in arachidonic acid 15-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase protein expression levels among subcutaneous fat, intramuscular fat, and muscle tissue were observed. Our results suggest that the combination of linoleic acid and the expression of lipid oxidase derived from beef muscle and intramuscular fat produce hydroxy fatty acids that result in a sweet aroma.	0
35207596	Characterization of Serum Metabolome and Proteome Profiles Identifies SNX5 Specific for Pregnancy Failure in Holstein Heifers.	Pregnancy loss predominantly occurs during the first 3-4 weeks due to fertilization failure or early embryonic losses in cattle. Insufficient biochemical communication between conceptus (embryo plus extraembryonic membranes) and endometrium has been suspected as the primary cause for early embryonic losses. If molecules regulating this communication were identified, molecular mechanisms associated with early pregnancy losses could be better understood. To identify candidate molecules as detection markers of non-pregnant  or females undergoing embryonic loss, peripheral blood from embryo-transferred heifers on day 7 (day 0 = day of estrus) were collected on days 17 (pre-attachment), 20 (during attachment), and 22 (post-attachment), which were subjected to metabolome and global proteome iTRAQ analyses. The metabolome analysis partly divided serum components into pregnant or not. In the iTRAQ analysis, heatmap analysis with top 25 proteins was separated into pregnant or not on day 20 or 22. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis identified five candidate proteins detecting non-pregnant heifers, of which SNX5 in day 22 serum had the highest area under the curve (AUC): 0.983. We  also detected SNX5 in day 22 serum from non-pregnant heifers using western blotting. These results suggest that high SNX5 in day 22 serum could predict early pregnancy loss in heifers.	0
35412417	Validation of serum paraoxonase/arylesterase 1 (PON1) as a protein marker of illicit dexamethasone treatment in veal calves.	The illicit use of dexamethasone and other glucocorticoids for cattle fattening in livestock production has been widely described; evidence for illegal treatments can be obtained by direct or indirect detection. In our previous study, we applied two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) to identify plasma protein markers of dexamethasone administration in veal calves. Comparison of 2DE maps obtained from blood samples before and after treatment showed the disappearance of two protein spots identified as serum paraoxonase/arylesterase 1 precursor (PON1). In the present study, we validated PON1 as a marker by analysing a larger number of samples treated with dexamethasone for illicit use.  Analysis of samples from experimental treatment with other glucocorticoids, androgens and oestrogens confirmed that their influence on PON1 could be excluded. The specificity of the PON1 protein marker was verified on expected negative field samples to exclude interfering factors. However, there is poor statistical evidence to support a significant association between the outcome of  PON1 and the considered variables. The results on field samples were compared with histological examination of the thymus as a biomarker of corticosteroid treatment monitored in the Italian histological plan for the control of growth promoters in animals. Two suspect cases were identified from two Piedmont farms where other animals had tested positive at histological examination. In conclusion, the absence of PON1 in the plasma of veal calves can indirectly reveal illicit dexamethasone treatment in individual animals and so identify suspect farms for further investigation. It is effective in a period ranging from 3 to about 10 days from illicit treatment, covering a time span that goes beyond  the limits of official chemical controls and preceding histological controls on the thymus of slaughtered animals. PON1 detection in plasma can be coupled with other tests to identify illegal dexamethasone use on veal calf farms.	0
35392625	DNA methylation dataset of bovine embryonic fibroblast cells treated with epigenetic modifiers and divergent energy supply.	Fetal programming is established early in life, likely through epigenetic mechanisms that control gene expression. Micronutrients can act as epigenetic modifiers (EM) by modulating the genome through mechanisms that include DNA methylation and post-translational modification of chromatin. Among the EM, methionine, choline, folate, and vitamin B12 have been suggested as key players of DNA methylation. However, the effects of supplementing these four EM, involved in the methionine folate cycle on DNA methylation, are still under investigation. This manuscript provides the genome-wide DNA methylation dataset (GSE180362) of bovine embryonic fibroblast cells exposed to different supplementation levels of  glucose and methionine, choline, folate, and vitamin B12 (collectively named as Epigenetic Modifiers - EM). The DNA methylation was measured using MSP-I digestion and Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing. Bioinformatics analyses included data quality control, read mapping, methylation calling, and differential methylation analyses. Supplementary file S1 and data analysis codes  are within this article. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset investigating the effects of four EM in bovine embryonic fibroblast DNA methylation profiles. Furthermore, this data and its findings provide information on putative candidate genes responsive to DNA methylation due to EM supplementation.	0
35334789	Evaluating the Effects of Diet-Gut Microbiota Interactions on Sleep Traits Using  the UK Biobank Cohort.	Previous studies showed that diet and gut microbiota had a correlation with sleep. However, the potential interaction effects of diet and gut microbiota on sleep are still unclear. The phenotypic data of insomnia (including 374,505 subjects) and sleep duration (including 372,805 subjects) were obtained from the  UK Biobank cohort. The Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with 114 gut microbiota, 84 dietary habits, and 4 dietary compositions were derived from the published Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS). We used Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSC) to estimate the genetic correlation and colocalization analysis to assess whether dietary habits and insomnia/sleep duration shared a causal variant in a region of the genome. Using UK Biobank genotype data, the polygenetic risk score of gut microbiota, dietary habits, and  dietary compositions were calculated for each subject. Logistic regression and linear regression models were used to assess the potential effects of diet-gut microbiota interactions on sleep phenotypes, including insomnia and sleep duration. Insomnia and sleep duration were used as dependent variables, and sex,  age, the Townsend Deprivation Index scores, and smoking and drinking habits were  selected as covariates in the regression analysis. All statistical analyses were  conducted using R-3.5.1 software. Significant genetic correlations were discovered between insomnia/sleep duration and dietary habits. Further, we found  several significant dietary compositions-gut microbiota interactions associated with sleep, such as fat × G_Collinsella_RNT (p = 1.843 × 10-2) and protein × G_Collinsella_HB (p = 7.11 × 10-3). Besides, multiple dietary habits-gut microbiota interactions were identified for sleep, such as overall beef intake ×  G_Desulfovibrio_RNT (p = 3.26 × 10-4), cups of coffee per day × G_Escherichia_Shigella_RNT (p = 1.14 × 10-3), and pieces of dried fruit per day × G_Bifidobacterium_RNT (p = 5.80 × 10-3). This study reported multiple diet-gut microbiota interactions associated with sleep, which may provide insights into the biological mechanisms of diet and gut microbiota affecting sleep.	0
35324839	PRM1 Gene Expression and Its Protein Abundance in Frozen-Thawed Spermatozoa as Potential Fertility Markers in Breeding Bulls.	Functional genes and proteins in sperm play an essential role in bulls' reproductive processes. They are more accurate in determining bull fertility than conventional semen quality tests. Protamine-1 (PRM1) is a gene or protein crucial for packaging and protecting sperm DNA until fertilization affects normal sperm function. This study analyzes the genes and proteins potential from PRM1 as fertility markers for different breeds of bulls utilized in the artificial insemination programs, expected to be an accurate tool in interpreting bull fertility in Indonesia. This study used Limousin, Holstein, and Ongole Grade bulls divided into two groups based on fertility, high-fertility (HF) and low fertility (LF). The semen quality assessment included progressive motility (computer-assisted semen analysis), viability (eosin-nigrosine), and plasma membrane integrity (HOS test). Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) was assessed using the acridine orange staining and the Halomax test. Sperm PRM deficiency was evaluated with the chromomycin A3 method. Moreover, PRM1 gene expression was measured using qRT-PCR, and the PRM1 protein abundance was measured with the enzyme immunoassay method. Semen quality values, relative expression of PRM1 gene, and quantity of PRM1 protein were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) in HF  bulls than in LF bulls. The SDF and PRM deficiency values in LF bulls were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) than HF bulls. Additionally, PRM1 at the gene  and protein levels correlated significantly (p &lt; 0.01) with fertility. Therefore, PRM1 is a potential candidate for fertility markers in bulls in Indonesia.	0
35307348	A single phenylalanine residue in β-arrestin2 critically regulates its binding to G protein-coupled receptors.	Arrestins and their yeast homologs, arrestin-related trafficking adaptors (ARTs), share a stretch of 29 amino acids called the ART motif. However, the functionality of that motif is unknown. We now report that deleting this motif prevents agonist-induced ubiquitination of β-arrestin2 (β-arr2) and blocks its association with activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Within the ART motif, we have identified a conserved phenylalanine residue, Phe116, that is critical for the formation of β-arr2-GPCR complexes. β-arr2 Phe116Ala mutant has  negligible effect on blunting β2-adrenergic receptor-induced cAMP generation unlike β-arr2, which promotes rapid desensitization. Furthermore, available structures for inactive and inositol hexakisphosphate 6-activated forms of bovine β-arr2 revealed that Phe116 is ensconced in a hydrophobic pocket, whereas the adjacent Phe117 and Phe118 residues are not. Mutagenesis of Phe117 and Phe118, but not Phe116, preserves GPCR interaction of β-arr2. Surprisingly, Phe116 is dispensable for the association of β-arr2 with its non-GPCR partners. β-arr2 Phe116Ala mutant presents a significantly reduced protein half-life compared with β-arr2 and undergoes constitutive Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination, which tags proteins for proteasomal degradation. We also found that Phe116 is critical for agonist-dependent β-arr2 ubiquitination with Lys-63-polyubiquitin linkages that are known mediators of protein scaffolding and signal transduction. Finally, we have shown that β-arr2 Phe116Ala interaction with activated β2-adrenergic receptor can be rescued with an in-frame fusion of ubiquitin. Taken together, we  conclude that Phe116 preserves structural stability of β-arr2, regulates the formation of β-arr2-GPCR complexes that inhibit G protein signaling, and promotes subsequent ubiquitin-dependent β-arr2 localization and trafficking.	0
35282913	Heat stress during the transition period is associated with impaired production,  reproduction, and survival in dairy cows.	Objectives of this retrospective cohort study were to determine the association of heat stress (HS) exposure during the periparturient period with production, health, reproduction, and survival during the first 90 d postpartum in dairy cows. A total of 5,722 Holstein cows (2,324 nulliparous and 3,397 parous) were categorized into environmental condition groups based on average temperature-humidity index (THI) exposure as thermoneutral (TN) or HS during the  prepartum (PRE) and early postpartum (POST) periods into TN-TN (THI: PRE = 57.9 and POST = 63.7), TN-HS (THI: PRE = 68.2 and POST = 72.0), HS-TN (THI: PRE = 71.4 and POST = 65.6), and HS-HS (THI PRE = 72.2 and POST = 72.7). Nulliparous and parous cows were analyzed separately. In nulliparous cows, exposure to HS during  the PRE, POST, or both PRE and POST periods was associated with a 1.7 kg/cow per  day reduction in milk yield compared with TN-TN. Postpartum HS was associated with increases of 4.4 percentage points in incidence of retained placenta, 18.1 percentage points in incidence of metritis, and 2.0 percentage points in incidence of mastitis, but a reduction of 5.3 percentage points in pregnancy at first AI, and an increase of 4.5 percentage points in pregnancy loss compared with POST TN. Exposure to HS during PRE and POST periods was associated with increased removal from the herd. In parous cows, exposure to HS during PRE, POST, or both PRE and POST was associated with a 2.4-kg/cow per day reduction in milk yield when compared with TN-TN. There was an interaction between HS exposure PRE  and POST and incidence of retained placenta, because POST HS was associated with  an increase in incidence of 5.8 percentage points within PRE HS cows, whereas no  difference was found within PRE TN cows. Postpartum HS was associated with an increase of 6.3 percentage points in incidence of metritis and tended to be associated with an increase of 1.9 percentage points in mastitis incidence compared with POST TN. There was an interaction between HS exposure PRE and POST  and pregnancy per AI because POST HS was associated with reduced pregnancy incidence by 10.6 percentage points within PRE TN cows, whereas no difference was found within PRE HS cows. Removal from the herd increased in cows exposed to HS during the PRE or POST or PRE and POST. These data suggest that POST HS is associated with performance losses to a greater extent than prepartum HS and that nulliparous and parous cows are prompt to losses associated with exposure to HS during the transition period. The results corroborate findings from manipulative  experiments that showed improved milk production and reproduction in cows under HS provided with heat abatement but adds insights to the associations between HS  and health.	0
35291953	Characterization of runs of homozygosity, heterozygosity-enriched regions, and population structure in cattle populations selected for different breeding goals.	BACKGROUND: A decline in the level of genetic diversity in livestock can result in reduced response to selection, greater incidence of genetic defects, and inbreeding depression. In this context, various metrics have been proposed to assess the level of genetic diversity in selected populations. Therefore, the main goals of this study were to: 1) investigate the population structure of 16 cattle populations from 15 different pure breeds or composite populations, which  have been selected for different breeds goals; and, 2) identify and compare runs  of homozygosity (ROH) and heterozygosity-enriched regions (HER) based on different single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels and whole-genome sequence data (WGS), followed by functional genomic analyses. RESULTS: A total of 24,187 ROH were found across all cattle populations, with 55% classified in the 2-4 Mb size group. Fourteen homozygosity islands were found in  five populations, where four ROH islands located on BTA1, BTA5, BTA16, and BTA19  overlapped between the Brahman (BRM) and Gyr (GIR) breeds. A functional analysis  of the genes found in these islands revealed candidate genes known to play a role in the melanogenesis, prolactin signaling, and calcium signaling pathways. The correlations between inbreeding metrics ranged from 0.02 to 0.95, where the methods based on homozygous genotypes (FHOM), uniting of gametes (FUNI), and genotype additive variance (FGRM) showed strong correlations among them. All methods yielded low to moderate correlations with the inbreeding coefficients based on runs of homozygosity (FROH). For the HER, 3576 runs and 26 islands, distributed across all autosomal chromosomes, were found in regions containing genes mainly related to the immune system, indicating potential balancing selection. Although the analyses with WGS did not enable detection of the same island patterns, it unraveled novel regions not captured when using SNP panel data. CONCLUSIONS: The cattle populations that showed the largest amount of ROH and HER were Senepol (SEN) and Montana (MON), respectively. Overlapping ROH islands were  identified between GIR and BRM breeds, indicating a possible historical connection between the populations. The distribution and pattern of ROH and HER are population specific, indicating that different breeds have experienced divergent selection processes or different genetic processes.	0
35332362	Effects of DGAT1 on milk performance in Sudanese Butana × Holstein crossbred cattle.	The improvement of milk production of indigenous Sudanese cattle such as Bos indicus Butana and its cross with Holstein is a major goal of the Sudanese government to ensure sufficient healthy nutrition in the country. In this study,  we investigated the K232A polymorphism of diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT1), a well-known modulator of milk production in other breeds. We determined allele frequencies and the allele effects on milk production. Therefore, 93 purebred Butana and 203 Butana × Holstein crossbred cattle were genotyped using competitive allele-specific PCR assays. Association analysis was performed using  a linear mixed model in R. In purebred Butana cattle, the lysine DGAT1 protein variant K232, which is found to be associated with higher fat and protein contents, as well as higher fat yield was highly frequent at 0.929, while its frequency in Butana × Holstein crossbred cattle was 0.394. Significant effects were found on milk yield (P = 7.6 × 10-20), fat yield (P = 2.2 × 10-17), protein  yield (P = 2.0 × 10-19) and lactose yield (P = 4.0 × 10-18) in crossbred cattle.  As expected, the protein variant K232 was disadvantageous since it was decreasing milk, protein, and lactose yields by 1.741 kg, 0.063 kg and 0.084 kg, respectively. No significant effects were found for milk fat, protein, and lactose contents. The high frequency of the lysine DGAT1 protein variant K232 in  Butana cattle could contribute to their high milk fat content in combination with low milk yield. In Butana × Holstein crossbred cattle, the DGAT1 marker can be used for effective selection and thus genetic improvement of milk production.	0
35450716	Association between genomic daughter pregnancy rates and reproductive parameters  in Holstein dairy cattle.	The objective of this observational study was to evaluate the relationship between genomic daughter pregnancy rate (GDPR) with reproduction parameters such  as pregnancy at first artificial insemination (AI), pregnancy per AI, and pregnancy losses (PL). A total of 12,949 events from 3,499 Holstein cows were included. Cows were enrolled as nulliparous (n = 1,220), primiparous (n = 1,314), or multiparous (n = 965). Cows were bred either after a timed AI protocol, timed  embryo transfer (ET), or spontaneous estrus. Most lactating cows were bred following a timed AI protocol based on estradiol and progesterone, and most nulliparous were artificially inseminated following estrus detection. Hair samples were collected from the tail switch and cows were genotyped using a SNP platform (Clarifide, Zoetis). Cows that were bred by timed AI were evaluated for  estrous behavior using tail chalk. Tail chalk was applied on the head of the tail 2 d before timed AI and the chalk was evaluated at AI (no estrus: 100% of chalk remaining or ≥50% of chalk remaining; Estrus: <50% of chalk remaining). Pregnancy diagnosis was performed at d 32 and 60 after AI using ultrasonography, and the presence of a heartbeat was considered a positive diagnosis. Pregnancy loss was defined as a pregnant cow on d 32 that was nonpregnant on d 60. As GDPR increased, the odds of pregnancy at first AI increased [odds ratio (OR) = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.20-1.35], the odds of pregnancy per AI increased (OR = 1.31, 95% CI =  1.25-1.36), and the odds of PL decreased (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.60-0.72). Most cows that were bred on the day of the timed AI demonstrated estrus (n = 6,075; 92.9%). The odds of demonstrating estrus on the day of timed AI increased as GDPR increased (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.17-1.48). There was no interaction between GDPR  and parity or breeding management for pregnancy at first AI, pregnancy per AI, and PL. In conclusion, the odds of pregnancy at first AI and pregnancy per AI increased as GDPR increased. Moreover, the odds of PL increased as GDPR decreased. Greater GDPR was also associated with greater occurrence of estrus on  the day of timed AI. These results suggest that selecting for higher GDPR could result in better reproductive performance, but this would need to be assessed with additional research.	0
35327183	The Utility of Serological Analysis for Neospora caninum Infection in Dairy Cattle Farms Management: Serological Investigation and Evaluation of the Effects  on Reproductive and Productive Performances in Two Study Herds in Northern Italy.	Neospora caninum is recognized as a major cause of abortion in cattle, determining economic losses, particularly in dairy industries. To evaluate the impact of neosporosis on herd efficiency, and to understand how the serological analysis for N. caninum is explicative of the farm picture, an epidemiological study was designed in two dairy farms recruited as a case study. Blood samples were collected from 540 animals, including cows and heifers over 12 months, and analyzed by an indirect immunofluorescent antibody test with subsequent antibody  titration. Overall, 94 animals (17.4%) were identified as positive to N. caninum  antibodies (15.5% and 18.5% in Farm 1 and Farm 2), with differences between the farms concerning the antibody titers (Chi-square, p-value = 0.04), particularly in cows (Chi-square, p-value = 0.018). Consequently, a different pattern of abortion episodes was depicted in the two investigated farms. Considering reproductive and productive performances, the number of inseminations necessary to make an animal pregnant was higher in seropositive cows (2.4 and 2.9 in Farm 1 and 2, respectively) than in seronegative ones (2.1 and 2.4 in Farm 1 and 2, respectively). Similarly, particularly in Farm 1, the number of days in milk of not-pregnant cows was higher in seropositive (167.7) than seronegative animals (133.4). Moreover, although the association between N. caninum infection and milk production is still unclear, both the daily milk production and the 305-mature equivalent milk yield were lower in seropositive (31.02 and 11,838.94) than seronegative cows (33.59 and 12,274.88) in Farm 1; an opposite pattern was otherwise depicted in Farm 2. The study showed that even if N. caninum circulated equally in the two herds, the dynamics of the parasite infection and its outcome  may be different, also depending on the specific situation of the farm. In this way, the integration of serological analysis for N. caninum, the reproductive and productive parameters, and the information on herd performances, could give specific indications for the application of control strategies.	0
35228409	Leptin receptor expression and its change in association with the normalization of EGF profile after seminal plasma treatment in repeat breeder dairy cows.	Factors associated with high milk production levels have been linked to alterations in the endometrial epidermal growth factor (EGF) profile, a cause of  reduced fertility in dairy cows. Therefore, we examined the leptin system that connects nutritional status and reproduction in dairy cattle related to reduced fertility in repeat breeder cows. Plasma leptin concentrations were measured in 18 heifers, 20 high-yielding control cows, and 26 repeat breeder cows, showing an altered EGF profile. Then, all repeat breeder cows were infused with seminal plasma (SP) into the vagina at the next estrus to normalize the EGF profile, while heifers and control cows were infused with vehicle alone. All animals were  examined for EGF profiles. Eighteen repeat breeder cows, nine heifers, and nine control cows were also determined for leptin receptor (Ob-R) expression levels in the estrous cycle before and after the infusion. SP normalized the EGF profile in 53.8% of the repeat breeder cows. Leptin concentrations were similar in all groups, regardless of the treatment results for the EGF profile. In contrast, Ob-R levels in repeat breeder and control cows were similar and higher than those in heifers before SP treatment. Ob-R in repeat breeders showing a normal EGF profile after treatment decreased to an intermediate level between heifers and control cows and may provide a clue to take measures against repeat breeding in dairy cows.	0
35305573	Identification of novel alternative splicing associated with mastitis disease in  Holstein dairy cows using large gap read mapping.	BACKGROUND: Mastitis is a very common disease in the dairy industry that producers encounter daily. Transcriptomics, using RNA-Sequencing (RNA - Seq) technology, can be used to study the functional aspect of mastitis resistance to  identify animals that have a better immune response to mastitis. When the cow has mastitis, not only genes but also specific mRNA isoforms generated via alternative splicing (AS) could be differentially expressed (DE), leading to the  phenotypic variation observed. Therefore, the objective of this study was to use  large gap read mapping to identify mRNA isoforms DE between healthy and mastitic  milk somatic cell samples (N = 12). These mRNA isoforms were then categorized based on being 1) annotated mRNA isoforms for gene name and length, 2) annotated  mRNA isoforms with different transcript length and 3) novel mRNA isoforms of non  - annotated genes. RESULTS: Analysis identified 333 DE transcripts (with at least 2 mRNA isoforms annotated, with at least one being DE) between healthy and mastitic samples corresponding to 303 unique genes. Of these 333 DE transcripts between healthy and mastitic samples, 68 mRNA isoforms are annotated in the bovine genome reference (ARS.UCD.1.2), 249 mRNA isoforms had novel transcript lengths of known  genes and 16 were novel transcript lengths of non - annotated genes in the bovine genome reference (ARS.UCD.1.2). Functional analysis including gene ontology, gene network and metabolic pathway analysis was performed on the list of 288 annotated and unique DE mRNA isoforms. In total, 67 significant metabolic pathways were identified including positive regulation of cytokine secretion and immune response. Additionally, numerous DE novel mRNA isoforms showed potential involvement with the immune system or mastitis. Lastly, QTL annotation analysis was performed on coding regions of the DE mRNA isoforms, identifying overlapping  QTLs associated with clinical mastitis and somatic cell score. CONCLUSION: This study identified novel mRNA isoforms generated via AS that could lead to differences in the immune response of Holstein dairy cows and be potentially implemented in future breeding programs.	0
35231779	Coupled steroid and phosphorus leaching from cattle slurry at lysimeter scale.	Water quality degradation can be caused by excessive agricultural nutrient transfers from fertilised soils exposed to wet weather. Mitigation measures within the EU Nitrates Directive aim to reduce this pressure by including 'closed' fertiliser spreading periods during wet months. For organic fertilisers  such as slurry and manure, this closed period requires sufficient on-farm winter  storage and good weather conditions to relieve storage at the end of the period.  Therefore, robust scientific evidence is needed to support the measure. Incidental nutrient transfers of recently applied organic fertilisers in wet weather can also be complicated by synchronous transfers from residual soil stores and tracing is required for risk assessments. The combination of nutrient  monitoring and biomarker analyses may aid this and one such biomarker suite is faecal steroids. Accordingly, this study investigated the persistence of steroids and their association with phosphorus during leaching episodes. The focus was on  the coupled behaviour of steroids and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in sub-surface hydrological pathways. Cattle slurry was applied to monolith lysimeters either side of a closed period and concentrations of both steroids and TP were monitored in the leachate. The study showed no significant effect of the  treatment (average p = 0.17), though tracer concentrations did significantly change over time (average p = 0.001). While the steroidal concentration ratio was validated for herbivorous faecal pollution in the leachate, there was a weak positive correlation between the steroids and TP. Further investigation at more natural scales (hillslope/catchment) is required to confirm tracer behaviours/correlations and to compliment this sub-surface pathway study.	0
35390123	Revealing the genetic basis of eyelid pigmentation in Hereford cattle.	Ocular squamous cell carcinoma and infectious keratoconjunctivitis are common ocular pathologies in Hereford cattle with considerable economic impact. Both pathologies have been associated with low eyelid pigmentation, and thus, genetic  selection for higher eyelid pigmentation could reduce their incidence. The objective of the present study was to reveal the genetic basis of eyelid pigmentation in Hereford cattle. The analysis included a single-step genome-wide  association study (ssGWAS) and a subsequent gene-set analysis in order to identify individual genes, genetic mechanisms and biological pathways implicated  in this trait. Data consisted of eyelid pigmentation records in 1,165 Hereford bulls and steers, visually assessed in five categories between 0% and 100%. Genotypic data for 774,660 single nucleotide polymorphism markers were available  for 886 animals with pigmentation records. Pedigree information of three generations of ancestors of animals with phenotype was considered in this study,  with a total of 4,929 animals. Our analyses revealed that eyelid pigmentation is  a moderately heritable trait, with heritability estimates around 0.41. The ssGWAS identified at least eight regions, located on BTA1, BTA3, BTA5, BTA14, BTA16, BTA18, BTA19 and BTA24, associated with eyelid pigmentation. These regions harbor genes that are directly implicated in melanocyte biology and skin pigmentation, such as ADCY8, PLD1, KITLG, and PRKCA. The gene-set analysis revealed several functional terms closely related to melanogenesis, such as positive regulation of melanocyte differentiation and regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade. Overall, our  findings provide evidence that eyelid pigmentation is a heritable trait influenced by many loci. Indeed, the ssGWAS detected several candidate genes that are directly implicated in melanocyte biology, including melanogenesis. This study contributes to a better understanding of the genetic and biological basis of eyelid pigmentation and presents novel information that could aid to design breeding strategies for reducing the incidence of ocular pathologies in cattle. Additional research on the genetic link between eyelid pigmentation and ocular pathologies is needed.	0
35400964	The first study on seroprevalence and risk factors of Neospora caninum infection  in pregnant local cows from Northeast Algeria.	Background and Aim: Neospora caninum is one of the most common infectious organisms worldwide that causes abortion in cattle. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have focused on N. caninum infection in the local Atlas brown cattle from Northeast Algeria. This study aimed to assess the importance of bovine neosporosis for causing abortion in Atlas brown cattle and to identify selected risk factors. Materials and Methods: A case-control study was performed on 60 control farms and 30 case farms. We collected 650 blood samples from 650 pregnant cows from 90 farms in five Algerian provinces; Jijel, Skikda, Annaba, El-Tarf, and Souk-Ahras. Sera samples were analyzed for the presence of antibodies against N. caninum using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: The seroprevalence of N. caninum infection in the cows was 36.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 32.7-39.8) and in the farms was 81.1% (95% CI: 73.0-89.2). Risk factors found by multivariable logistic regression included: Presence of dogs (odds ratio [OR] 4.7, 95 CI 2.9-7.3); age ≥84 months (OR 4.9, 95 CI 2.8-8.3); Jijel region (OR 2.2, 95 CI 1.1-4.5); white (OR 2.5, 95 CI 1.4-4.4)  and gray (OR 2.5, 95 CI 1.4-4.5) coat; moderate (OR 2.30, 95 CI 1.4-3.8) and bad  (OR 3.1, 95 CI 1.8-5.3) hygiene; and second (OR 2.5, 95 CI 1.4-4.4); and last (OR 2.3, 95 CI 1.3-4.2) stage of pregnancy. Our case-control study showed no significant association between seropositivity of N. caninum and abortion at the  farms level (OR 0.9, 95 CI 0.3-2.7). Similarly, there was no significant association between seropositivity of N. caninum and abortion at the individual level (OR 0.8, 95 CI 0.6-1.2). Conclusion: This is the first study of N. caninum infection in pregnant local cows from Northeast Algeria. The prevalence rate of antibodies against N. caninum was high. Almost all risk factors studied for infection were significantly associated with seroprevalence. Our analysis showed no relation between N. caninum infection and abortion. Consequently, these local cows are resistant to abortion caused by N. caninum.	0
35335790	Construction of N-CDs and Calcein-Based Ratiometric Fluorescent Sensor for Rapid  Detection of Arginine and Acetaminophen.	"In our study, a unique ratiometric fluorescent sensor for the rapid detection of  arginine (Arg) and acetaminophen (AP) was constructed by the integration of blue  fluorescent N-CDs and yellowish-green fluorescent calcein. The N-CD/calcein ratiometric fluorescent sensor exhibited dual emission at 435 and 519 nm under the same excitation wavelength of 370 nm, and caused potential Förster resonance  energy transfer (FRET) from N-CDs to calcein. When detecting Arg, the blue fluorescence from the N-CDs of the N-CD/calcein sensor was quenched by the interaction of N-CDs and Arg. Then, the fluorescence of our sensor was recovered  with the addition of AP, possibly due to the stronger association between AP and  Arg, leading to the dissociation of Arg from N-CDs. Meanwhile, we observed an obvious fluorescence change from blue to green, then back to blue, when Arg and AP were added, exhibiting the ""on-off-on"" pattern. Next, we determined the detection limits of the N-CD/calcein sensor to Arg and AP, which were as low as 0.08 μM and 0.02 μM, respectively. Furthermore, we discovered that the fluorescence changes of the N-CD/calcein sensor were only responsible for Arg and AP. These results suggested its high sensitivity and specificity for Arg and AP detection. In addition, we have successfully achieved its application in bovine serum samples, indicating its practicality. Lastly, the logic gate was generated  by the N-CD/calcein sensor and presented its good reversibility. Overall, we have demonstrated that our N-CD/calcein sensor is a powerful sensor to detect Arg and  AP and that it has potential applications in biological analysis and imaging."	0
35342738	Efficacy of synergistic activity of seed oils from Carthamus tinctorius (Safflower) and Nasturtium officinale (Watercress) on the lethality of the cattle tick Hyalomma scupense (Acari: Ixodidae).	Background: Ticks and tick-borne diseases are a severe economic and public-health problem for cattle producers. The emergence of acaricide resistance to synthetic  chemical treatments has prompted interest in developing alternative tick control  methods. Aim: The main objective of the current research was to identify the chemical structure of Carthamus tinctorius and Nasturtium officinale seed oils and to assess their anti-tick properties against Hyalomma scupense ticks both alone and  in combination (1:1). Methods: Analytical methods were used to analyze the chemical components. For in  vitro assays, adults of H. scupense were immersed in C. tinctorius and N. officinale seed oils at 100, 125, 200, and 300 mg/ml concentrations; for 5 minutes. Larvae of H. scupense were dipped in 25, 50, 100, 125, 200, and 300 mg/ml doses of seed oils; the mortality percentage was determined after 24 hours. Results: The seed oil safflower was mainly composed of linoleic acid (84.48%), followed by palmitic acid (6.54%) and stearic acid (3.77%). Meanwhile, watercress seed oil was mainly composed of linolenic acid (50.78%), gondoic acid (13.57%), linoleic acid (10.58%), palmitic acid (8.02%), and erucidic acid (6.62%). The Adults Immersion Test showed the sensitivity of ticks to C. tinctorius and N. officinale seed oil: C. tinctorius seed oil caused (95%) mortality of H. scupense at 300 mg/ml, while N. officinale seed oil induced (88.68%) mortality at the same concentration. At a 200 mg/ml concentration, C. tinctorius and N. officinale oil  combined caused 100% mortality. Tested oils showed larvicidal efficacy. LC50 values for C. tinctorius and N. officinale seed oils were 84.16 and 61.78 mg/ml,  respectively, in 24 hours. LC50 value of oils association (50% C. tinctorius: 50% N. officinale) was 47.96 mg/ml.The mixture of seed oils from two plants tested against H. scupense larvae and adult females at a 1:1 ratio showed synergistic interaction. Conclusion: Seed oils tested alone, and the mixture could be used as an alternative solution in the fight against ticks.	0
35337023	Environmental Effects on Viable Virus Transport and Resuspension in Ventilation Airflow.	To understand how SARS-CoV-2 spreads indoors, in this study bovine coronavirus was aerosolized as simulant into a plexiglass chamber with coupons of metal, wood and plastic surfaces. After aerosolization, chamber and coupon surfaces were swiped to quantify the virus concentrations using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Bio-layer interferometry showed stronger virus association on plastic and metal surfaces, however, higher dissociation from wood in 80% relative humidity. Virus aerosols were collected with the 100 L/min wetted wall cyclone and the 50 L/min MD8 air sampler and quantitated by qPCR. To monitor the  effect of the ventilation on the virus movement, PRD1 bacteriophages as virus simulants were disseminated in a ¾ scale air-conditioned hospital test room with  twelve PM2.5 samplers at 15 L/min. Higher virus concentrations were detected above the patient's head and near the foot of the bed with the air inlet on the ceiling above, exhaust bottom left on the wall. Based on room layout, air measurements and bioaerosol collections computational flow models were created to visualize the movement of the virus in the room airflow. The addition of air curtain at the door minimized virus concentration while having the inlet and exhaust on the ceiling decreased overall aerosol concentration. Controlled laboratory experiments were conducted in a plexiglass chamber to gain more insight into the fundamental behavior of aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 and understand its fate and transport in the ambient environment of the hospital room.	0
35282903	Association of housing and management practices with milk yield, milk composition, and fatty acid profile, predicted using Fourier transform mid-infrared spectroscopy, in farms with automated milking systems.	Milk fatty acid (FA) profile can be divided into (1) de novo (C4-C14) that are synthesized in the mammary gland; (2) preformed (≥C18) that are absorbed from blood and originate from mobilized adipose tissues or dietary fat; and (3) mixed  (C16), which have both origins. Our objectives were to describe the FA profile, as predicted using Fourier transform mid-infrared spectroscopy, of bulk tank milk from automated milking system (AMS) farms and to assess the association of management and housing factors with the bulk tank milk composition and FA profile of those AMS farms. The data used were collected from 124 commercial Canadian Holstein dairy farms with AMS, located in the provinces of Ontario (n = 68) and Quebec (n = 56). The farms were visited once from April to September 2019, and information were collected on barn design and herd management practices. Information regarding individual cow milk yield (kg/d), days in milk, parity, and the number of milking cows were automatically collected by the AMS units on each  farm. These data were extracted for the entire period that the bulk tank milk samples were monitored, from April 2019 to April 2020 in Quebec and from August 2019 to May 2020 in Ontario. Across herds, milk yield averaged (mean ± standard error) 35.9 ± 0.4 kg/d, with 3.97 ± 0.01% fat and 3.09 ± 0.01% protein, whereas FA profile averaged 26.2 ± 0.1, 33.1 ± 0.1, and 40.7 ± 0.2 g/100 g of FA for de novo, mixed, and preformed, respectively. The FA yield averaged 0.34 ± 0.01, 0.44 ± 0.01, and 0.54 ± 0.01 kg/d for de novo, mixed, and preformed, respectively. Multivariable regression models were used to associate herd-level housing factors and management practices with milk production, composition, and FA profile. Milk  yield was positively associated with using a robot feed pusher (+2.1 kg/d) and the use of deep bedding (+2.6 kg/d). The use of a robot feed pusher, deep bedding, and greater stall raking frequency were positively associated with greater yield (kg/d) of de novo, mixed, preformed, and de novo + mixed FA. Use of deep bedding was negatively associated with concentration of fat, de novo FA, mixed FA, and de novo + mixed FA, expressed in grams per 100 g (%) of milk. A wider lying alley width (≥305 cm) was associated with a greater concentration (g/100 g of milk) of de novo and de novo + mixed FA. Greater frequency of partial mixed ration delivery (>2×/d vs. 1 and 2×/d) was positively associated with a greater proportion (g/100 g of FA) of de novo, mixed, and de novo + mixed FA and  negatively associated with the proportion of preformed FA. Overall, these associations indicated that bulk tank FA profile can be used as a tool to monitor and adjust management and housing in AMS farms.	0
35379858	Recovery of mitogenomes from whole genome sequences to infer maternal diversity in 1883 modern taurine and indicine cattle.	Maternal diversity based on a sub-region of mitochondrial genome or variants were commonly used to understand past demographic events in livestock. Additionally, there is growing evidence of direct association of mitochondrial genetic variants with a range of phenotypes. Therefore, this study used complete bovine mitogenomes from a large sequence database to explore the full spectrum of maternal diversity. Mitogenome diversity was evaluated among 1883 animals representing 156 globally important cattle breeds. Overall, the mitogenomes were  diverse: presenting 11 major haplogroups, expanding to 1309 unique haplotypes, with nucleotide diversity 0.011 and haplotype diversity 0.999. A small proportion of African taurine (3.5%) and indicine (1.3%) haplogroups were found among the European taurine breeds and composites. The haplogrouping was largely consistent  with the population structure derived from alternate clustering methods (e.g. PCA and hierarchical clustering). Further, we present evidence confirming a new indicine subgroup (I1a, 64 animals) mainly consisting of breeds originating from  China and characterised by two private mutations within the I1 haplogroup. The total genetic variation was attributed mainly to within-breed variance (96.9%). The accuracy of the imputation of missing genotypes was high (99.8%) except for the relatively rare heteroplasmic genotypes, suggesting the potential for trait association studies within a breed.	0
35275284	The association between meat and fish intake by preparation methods and breast cancer in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS).	PURPOSE: We examined the associations between intake of meat and fish by preparation methods and breast cancer in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study, a racially diverse population-based case-control study. METHODS: African American (AA) and European American (EA) women aged 20-74 years  with a first diagnosis of invasive or in situ breast cancers were frequency matched by race and age group to controls identified through the North Carolina Division of Motor Vehicles and Medicare lists [AA: 548 cases, 452 controls; EA: 858 cases, 748 controls]. Participants self-reported meat preparation methods and intake frequencies. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)  were calculated using multivariable logistic regression adjusted for age, race, alcohol intake, body mass index, family income, lactation, marital status, use of oral contraceptives, postmenopausal hormone use, smoking status, and offsets. RESULTS: Positive associations with breast cancer were observed for intakes of grilled/barbecued hamburger (≥ once/week, OR: 1.28; 95% CI 1.01, 1.63), and pan-fried/oven-broiled beef steak (≥ once/week, OR: 1.36; 95% CI 1.08, 1.72). Inverse associations were observed for pan-fried fish (≥ once/week, OR: 0.77; 95% CI 0.60, 0.98), and for grilled/ barbecued pork chops (> 0 time/week OR: 0.81, 95% CI 0.68, 0.97). Associations tended to be stronger among EA women than among  AA women. CONCLUSION: More frequent consumption of beef prepared with high temperature methods was associated with higher odds of breast cancer while more frequent consumption of pan-fried fish or grilled/barbecued pork chops was associated with lower odds of breast cancer.	0
35346462	Integrating heterogeneous across-country data for proxy-based random forest prediction of enteric methane in dairy cattle.	Direct measurements of methane (CH4) from individual animals are difficult and expensive. Predictions based on proxies for CH4 are a viable alternative. Most prediction models are based on multiple linear regressions (MLR) and predictor variables that are not routinely available in commercial farms, such as dry matter intake (DMI) and diet composition. The use of machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict CH4 emissions from across-country heterogeneous data sets has not been reported. The objectives were to compare performances of ML ensemble algorithm random forest (RF) and MLR models in predicting CH4 emissions from proxies in dairy cows, and assess effects of imputing missing data points on prediction accuracy. Data on CH4 emissions and proxies for CH4 from 20 herds were provided by 10 countries. The integrated data set contained 43,519 records from 3,483 cows, with 18.7% missing data points imputed using k-nearest neighbor imputation. Three data sets were created, 3k (no missing records), 21k (missing DMI imputed from milk, fat, protein, body weight), and 41k (missing DMI, milk fat, and protein records imputed). These data sets were used to test scenarios (with or without DMI, imputed vs. nonimputed DMI, milk fat, and protein), and prediction models (RF vs. MLR). Model predictive ability was evaluated within and between herds through 10-fold cross-validation. Prediction accuracy was measured  as correlation between observed and predicted CH4, root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG). Inclusion of DMI in the model improved within and between-herd prediction accuracy to 0.77 (RMSE = 23.3%) and 0.58 (RMSE = 31.9%) in RF and to 0.50 (RMSE = 0.327) and 0.13 (RMSE = 42.71)  in MLR, respectively than when DMI was not included in the predictive model. When missing DMI records were imputed, within and between-herd accuracy increased to 0.84 (RMSE = 18.5%) and 0.63 (RMSE = 29.9%), respectively. In all scenarios, RF models out-performed MLR models. Results suggest routinely measured variables from dairy farms can be used in developing globally robust prediction models for  CH4 if coupled with state-of-the-art techniques for imputation and advanced ML algorithms for predictive modeling.	0
35215125	Molecular Characterization of Bovine Leukemia Virus with the Evidence of a New Genotype Circulating in Cattle from Kazakhstan.	Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is a retrovirus that causes enzootic bovine leukosis  (EBL) and has worldwide distribution. Infections with BLV have been reported in cattle from Kazakhstan but the virus has not yet been thoroughly characterized. In this study, we detect and estimate the level of BLV proviral DNA by qPCR in DNA samples from 119 cattle naturally infected with BLV, from 18 farms located in four different geographical regions of Kazakhstan. Furthermore, we conducted the  phylogenetic and molecular analysis of 41 BLV env-gp51 gene sequences from BLV infected cattle. Phylogenetic analysis showed the affiliation of sequences to two already known genotypes G4 and G7 and also to a new genotype, classified as genotype G12. In addition, a multivariate method was employed for analysis of the association between proviral load and different variables such as the geographical location of the herd, cattle breeds, age of animals, and the presence of particular BLV genotypes. In summary, the results of this study provide the first evidence on molecular characterization of BLV circulating in cattle from Kazakhstan.	0
35321292	The migration of the bovine-derived xenograft particles: A case series.	The long-term safety of xenografts and their potential association with disease are valid concerns. Bovine bone substitutes which are by far the most commonly used xenografts in dentistry are not biodegradable. The aim of the present report was to raise awareness on the long-term risks of the bovine-derived xenografts. Patients who experienced clinical complications after xenografting are reported.  Patients' demographic, significant medical, and dental findings are reported. Complications included migration/encapsulation/displacement of the graft material, chronic inflammation, and soft-tissue disturbances/fenestrations. Albeit some xenograft complications are not significant enough to compromise the  initial outcomes achieved, the xenografted particles seemed to be left intact favoring conditions for migration. The authors observed the inability of the human host to biodegrade the xenograft particles. The intact/migrated bovine bone particles present a risk to patients and may contribute to long-term clinical complications in implant dentistry.	0
35268227	Associations between Animal Welfare Indicators and Animal-Related Factors of Slaughter Cattle in Austria.	Three cattle welfare indicators (lameness, dirtiness, and abomasal disorders) were evaluated in 412 slaughter cattle in a cross-sectional study in Austria. The aims of this study were (1) to evaluate the prevalence of lameness, dirtiness of  slaughter cattle, and abomasal disorders; and (2) to determine the association between these welfare indicators and animal-related factors (e.g., housing type,  carcass weight, transportation and waiting duration of the animals). The lameness prevalence was 0.73%, the abomasal disorders prevalence was 52.43%, and 88.59% of all cattle were contaminated. The latter result indicates that the cattle were kept in a dirty environment. The occurrence of abomasal disorders was associated  with cattle housing systems (p ≤ 0.00) and slaughter weight (p = 0.03). The odds  for abomasal disorders were 28.0 times higher for cattle housed on slatted flooring compared to cattle kept in a tethered system. The chance for occurrence  of abomasal disorders was 3.6 times higher for cattle with a low carcass weight compared to cattle with a high carcass weight. Furthermore, significant associations were found between dirtiness (also referred to as cleanliness or contamination) and husbandry system, sex, and breed. Cattle housed in deep litter boxes had 40.8 times higher odds of being contaminated compared to cattle in a tethered housing system. Cows (odds: 32.9) and heifers (odds: 4.4) had higher odds of being contaminated with feces compared to bulls, whereby female calves (odds: 0.09) and male calves (odds: 0.02) had significantly lower odds of being contaminated. Furthermore, the breeds Brown Swiss (odds: 0.26) and Holstein-Friesian (odds: 0.14) had a significantly lower chance of being contaminated compared to Simmental cattle. Other collected factors, such as production system, transportation duration, life days of the cattle, average daily weight gain, carcass classification, and fat coverage, showed no association with the collected welfare indicators. The study presented here indicates that welfare indicators evaluated for slaughter cattle are suitable to  assess cattle welfare, and improvements in husbandry may positively impact both the abomasal physiology and cleanliness of cattle.	0
35440706	Long-term artificial selection of Hanwoo (Korean) cattle left genetic signatures  for the breeding traits and has altered the genomic structure.	Indigenous Korean breeds such as Hanwoo (Korean) cattle have adapted to their local environment during the past 5000 years. In the 1980s, the National Genetic  Improvement Program was established to develop a modern economic breed for beef production in Korea through artificial selection. This process is thought to have altered the genomic structure of breeding traits over time. The detection of genetic variants under selection could help to elucidate the genetic mechanism of artificial selection in modern cattle breeds. Indigenous Hanwoo cattle have adapted in response to local natural and artificial selection during a 40-year breeding program. We analyzed genomic changes in the selection signatures of an unselected population (USP; n = 362) and a selected population (KPN; n = 667) of  Hanwoo cattle. Genomic changes due to long-term artificial selection were identified using a genome-wide integrated haplotype score (iHS) and a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Signatures of recent selection were detected as positive (piHS > 6) or negative (piHS < -6) iHS scores spanning more than 46 related genes in KPN cattle, but none in USP cattle. A region adjacent to the PLAG1 gene was found to be under strong selection for carcass weight. The GWAS results also showed a selection signature on BTA14, but none on BTA13. Pathway and quantitative trait locus analysis results identified candidate genes related  to energy metabolism, feed efficiency, and reproductive traits in Hanwoo cattle.  Strong selection significantly altered Hanwoo cattle genome structural properties such as linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotypes through causal mutation for target traits. Haplotype changes of genome structure which are changes of ancestral allele to derived alleles due to selection were clearly identified on BTA13 and BTA14; however, the structure of the LD block was not clearly observed  except BTA14. Thus, selection based on EBVs would be working very well in Hanwoo  cattle breeding program appears to have been highly successful.	0
35222335	Identification of Type VI Secretion Systems Effector Proteins That Contribute to  Interbacterial Competition in Salmonella Dublin.	The Type VI Secretion System (T6SS) is a multiprotein device that has emerged as  an important fitness and virulence factor for many Gram-negative bacteria through the injection of effector proteins into prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells via a contractile mechanism. While some effector proteins specifically target bacterial or eukaryotic cells, others can target both types of cells (trans-kingdom effectors). In Salmonella, five T6SS gene clusters have been identified within pathogenicity islands SPI-6, SPI-19, SPI-20, SPI-21, and SPI-22, which are differentially distributed among serotypes. Salmonella enterica serotype Dublin (S. Dublin) is a cattle-adapted pathogen that harbors both T6SSSPI-6 and T6SSSPI-19. Interestingly, while both systems have been linked to virulence and host colonization in S. Dublin, an antibacterial activity has not been detected for T6SSSPI-6 in this serotype. In addition, there is limited information regarding the repertoire of effector proteins encoded within T6SSSPI-6 and T6SSSPI-19 gene clusters in S. Dublin. In the present study, we demonstrate that  T6SSSPI-6 and T6SSSPI-19 of S. Dublin CT_02021853 contribute to interbacterial competition. Bioinformatic and comparative genomic analyses allowed us to identify genes encoding three candidate antibacterial effectors located within SPI-6 and two candidate effectors located within SPI-19. Each antibacterial effector gene is located upstream of a gene encoding a hypothetic immunity protein, thus conforming an effector/immunity (E/I) module. Of note, the genes encoding these effectors and immunity proteins are widely distributed in Salmonella genomes, suggesting a relevant role in interbacterial competition and  virulence. Finally, we demonstrate that E/I modules SED_RS01930/SED_RS01935 (encoded in SPI-6), SED_RS06235/SED_RS06230, and SED_RS06335/SED_RS06340 (both encoded in SPI-19) contribute to interbacterial competition in S. Dublin CT_02021853.	0
35444687	Genetic Modeling and Genomic Analyses of Yearling Temperament in American Angus Cattle and Its Relationship With Productive Efficiency and Resilience Traits.	Cattle temperament has been considered by farmers as a key breeding goal due to its relevance for cattlemen's safety, animal welfare, resilience, and longevity and its association with many economically important traits (e.g., production and meat quality). The definition of proper statistical models, accurate variance component estimates, and knowledge on the genetic background of the indicator trait evaluated are of great importance for accurately predicting the genetic merit of breeding animals. Therefore, 266,029 American Angus cattle with yearling temperament records (1-6 score) were used to evaluate statistical models and estimate variance components; investigate the association of sex and farm management with temperament; assess the weighted correlation of estimated breeding values for temperament and productive, reproductive efficiency and resilience traits; and perform a weighted single-step genome-wide association analysis using 69,559 animals genotyped for 54,609 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Sex and extrinsic factors were significantly associated with temperament, including conception type, age of dam, birth season, and additional  animal-human interactions. Similar results were observed among models including only the direct additive genetic effect and when adding other maternal effects. Estimated heritability of temperament was equal to 0.39 on the liability scale. Favorable genetic correlations were observed between temperament and other relevant traits, including growth, feed efficiency, meat quality, and reproductive traits. The highest approximated genetic correlations were observed  between temperament and growth traits (weaning weight, 0.28; yearling weight, 0.28). Altogether, we identified 11 genomic regions, located across nine chromosomes including BTAX, explaining 3.33% of the total additive genetic variance. The candidate genes identified were enriched in pathways related to vision, which could be associated with reception of stimulus and/or cognitive abilities. This study encompasses large and diverse phenotypic, genomic, and pedigree datasets of US Angus cattle. Yearling temperament is a highly heritable  and polygenic trait that can be improved through genetic selection. Direct selection for temperament is not expected to result in unfavorable responses on other relevant traits due to the favorable or low genetic correlations observed.  In summary, this study contributes to a better understanding of the impact of maternal effects, extrinsic factors, and various genomic regions associated with  yearling temperament in North American Angus cattle.	0
35225175	Identification and dynamic expression profiling of circadian clock genes in Spodoptera litura provide new insights into the regulation of sex pheromone communication.	Spodoptera litura is an important pest that causes significant economic damage to numerous crops worldwide. Sex pheromones (SPs) mediate sexual communication in S. litura and show a characteristic degree of rhythmic activity, occurring mainly during the scotophase; however, the specific regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we employed a genome-wide analysis to identify eight candidate circadian clock genes in S. litura. Sequence characteristics and expression patterns were analyzed. Our results demonstrated that some circadian clock genes  might regulate the biosynthesis and perception of SPs by regulating the rhythmic  expression of SP biosynthesis-related genes and SP perception-related genes. Interestingly, all potential genes exhibited peak expression in the scotophase, consistent with the SP could mediate courtship and mating behavior in S. litura.  Our findings are helpful in elucidating the molecular mechanism by which circadian clock genes regulate sexual communication in S. litura.	0
35405644	Molecular Characterization of Rickettsial Agents in Ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) from  Sri Lanka.	Because the majority of spotted fever group rickettsiae are transmitted to humans by tick bites, it is important to understand which ticks might play a role in transmission of rickettsial pathogens in Sri Lanka. The purpose of our study was  to conduct molecular surveillance of 847 ticks collected in different locations in central Sri Lanka to determine which were infected with Rickettsia and Anaplasmataceae. Molecular methods were used to identify the ticks and the agents detected. Most ticks (Amblyomma, Haemaphysalis, and Rhipicephalus) were collected by flagging, and lower number was collected from dogs, cattle, pigs, a pangolin,  and tortoises. Five spotted fever genotypes were identified: a Rickettsia africae-like agent in Amblyomma larvae, Rhipicephalus massiliae and a related genotype identified in association with the tropical type of Rhipicephalus sanguineus from dogs and Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides from dogs and cattle, and Candidatus R. kellyi and another novel genotype (SL94) in R. haemaphysaloides. Twenty-three ticks were positive for Anaplasmataceae, including one Anaplasma and two Ehrlichia genotypes. Because the sequence database for both ticks and rickettsial agents from Sri Lanka and southern India is not extensive, additional molecular characterization of the tick species of Sri Lanka and their rickettsial agents is required to understand their pathogenic potential more completely. However, several of the agents we identified in this survey may well be pathogenic for humans and domestic animals, and should be considered as a part of epidemiological surveillance and patient management.	0
34509172	Transcriptome analysis reveals key genes and pathways associated with egg production in Nandan-Yao domestic chicken.	BACKGROUND: Egg production is a very important economic trait in chicken breeding, but its molecular mechanism is unclear until now. Nandan-Yao chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a native breed in Guangxi province, China, which is famous for good meet quality, but with low egg production. METHODS: To explore the molecular regulation related to egg production, high egg  production (HEP) and low egg production (LEP) were divided according to the total egg number at 55 weeks, and the concentration of serum sex hormones was tested to evaluate the physiological function of ovary and uterus. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to explore the transcriptome from the ovary and uterus of Nandan-Yao chicken. RESULTS: The levels of serum sex hormone showed that concentrations of estradiol  (E2), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteotropic hormone (LH) were significantly higher in HEP than those in LEP (P < 0.01), while the concentration of testosterone (T) was significantly lower in HEP (P < 0.01). RNA-Seq analysis identified 901 and 2763 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ovary and uterus, respectively. Enrichment analysis showed that DEGs were significantly involved in the regulation of tight junction in the ovary (P < 0.05), while in uterus, DEGs were mainly enriched in the phagosome, ECM-receptor interaction, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), focal adhesion, cardiac muscle contraction, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and the regulation of MAPK signaling pathway (P < 0.05). Protein network interaction and function analyses revealed that FN1, FGF7, SOX2 identified from the ovary, and UQCRH, COX5A, FN1 from the uterus might be key candidate genes for egg production in Nandan-Yao chicken. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided key candidate genes and pathways involved in the  egg-laying process of Nandan-Yao chicken and could help to further understand the molecular mechanisms of chicken reproduction.	0
34677025	Induction of General Anesthesia With Alfaxalone in the Domestic Chicken.	Alfaxalone is a safe and effective anesthetic drug for the induction of general anesthesia in many nonavian companion animal species; however, its efficacy has not been fully evaluated in birds. In premedicated trials, the chickens were sedated with butorphanol 2 mg/kg intramuscularly and midazolam 0.5 mg/kg intramuscularly, 15 minutes before intravenous administration of alfaxalone. The  chickens were classified as anesthetized if endotracheal intubation was achieved  without eliciting a cough reflex, provoking no patient resistance, and with minimal glottis movement within 15 seconds after the administration of alfaxalone. Qualitative and quantitative data were recorded, including duration of anesthesia, quality of induction, quality of recovery, reflexes, time to sternal recumbency, time to standing, and time to normal behaviors. Survival analysis was used to analyze the association between alfaxalone dosage and premedication with time-related variables. Out of the evaluated doses, the lowest intravenous alfaxalone dose required to achieve anesthetic induction and endotracheal intubation in unpremedicated and premedicated chickens was 7.5 and 4 mg/kg, respectively. The duration of anesthesia for all dose rates within the study ranged from 51 seconds to 4 minutes 45 seconds. Premedication generally improved the quality of induction and recovery, but significantly (P < .001) increased the time required for the chickens to stand after being anesthetized and to return to normal behaviors. Most chickens exhibited varying degrees of hyperactivity on anesthetic induction and recovery. No postinduction apnea or deaths of the subject birds occurred during this investigation.	0
35155537	Association Between Dietary Patterns and Different Metabolic Phenotypes in Japanese Adults: WASEDA'S Health Study.	Although many studies have reported that a posteriori dietary pattern is associated with metabolic health, there is little evidence of an association between dietary patterns and different metabolic phenotypes. The present study aimed to examine the association between major dietary patterns and different metabolic phenotypes (metabolically healthy non-obese [MHNO], metabolically unhealthy non-obese [MUNO], metabolically healthy obese [MHO], and metabolically  unhealthy obese [MUO]) in middle-aged and elderly Japanese adults. This cross-sectional study enrolled 2,170 Japanese adults aged ≥40 years. The four different metabolic phenotypes were determined based on the presence of obesity,  abdominal obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia. The major dietary patterns were determined using principal component analysis based on energy-adjusted food intake. Two dietary patterns were identified: the healthy dietary pattern, which was characterized by a high intake of vegetables, fruits,  potatoes, soy products, mushrooms, seaweeds, and fish; and the alcohol dietary pattern, which was characterized by a high intake of alcoholic beverages, liver,  chicken, and fish. The healthy dietary pattern was associated with the MHNO and MHO phenotypes (MUNO and MUO as reference groups, respectively), and the multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) in the highest quartile of healthy dietary pattern score with the lowest quartile as the reference category were 2.10 (1.40-3.15) and 1.86 (1.06-3.25), respectively. Conversely, the alcohol dietary pattern was inversely associated with the MHNO and MHO phenotypes, while the multivariate-adjusted ORs (95% CIs) in the highest  quartile of the alcohol dietary pattern score with the lowest quartile as the reference category were 0.63 (0.42-0.94) and 0.45 (0.26-0.76), respectively. There were no significant interactions between sex and healthy/alcohol dietary patterns in the prevalence of the MHNO and MHO phenotypes. In conclusion, the present study's findings suggest that major dietary patterns are associated with  different metabolic phenotypes in middle-aged and elderly Japanese adults. These  findings provide useful evidence for maintaining metabolic health through diet regardless of obesity status.	0
34547619	Factors affecting gene expression associated with the skin color of black-bone chicken in Thailand.	The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of breed, sex, and age  on the gene expression level of melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), DOPA chrome tautomerase (DCT), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), tyrosinase (TYR), and agouti signaling protein (ASIP) genes in Thai commercial chicken lines. All chicken have received Newscastle vaccination, and no antibiotics or any drugs were used in this study. Four chicken breeds including Black-Chinese, KU-Phuparn, Sri Mok, and Pradu Hang Dam were used in this study. These breeds can be classified by their skin color into 3 group including black (Black Chinese and KU-Phuparn), light black (Sri Mok), and yellowish white (Pradu Hang Dam). One hundred chickens per breed were used in this study. Breast skin tissue was randomly collected from 8 chickens (4 males, 4 females) per breed at 4, 8, 12, and 16 wk of age. The mRNA expression was analyzed using qRT-PCR and the gene expression level was calculated as 2-ΔΔCT. From the results, breed significantly  (P < 0.01) affected the expression level for the 5 genes evaluated. Birds with the black skin color had greater TYRP1 and TYR gene expression when compared to chickens with light black and yellowish-white skin color, respectively. Whereas,  chickens with yellowish-white skin color had greater ASIP gene expression when compared to chickens having the other skin colors. Sex significantly affected DCT, TYRP1, and TYR gene expression where the gene expression in males was greater when compared to females (P < 0.05). Age affected all gene expression levels (P < 0.01). At 4 wk of age, MC1R, DCT, TYRP1, and TYR gene expression was  the highest and decreased as bird age increased (P < 0.05); however, ASIP gene expression was greatest at 8 wk of age. After 8 wk of age all gene expression for the genes evaluated in this study decreased as age increased. In addition, an interaction between breed and sex (P < 0.05) impacted DCT and ASIP gene expression. The results from this study showed that all genes evaluated can be used as candidate markers to further improve the blackness of the chicken's skin  because the most desired skin color is black in the Thai black-bone chicken population.	0
35056020	Investigation of the Potential of Heterophil/Lymphocyte Ratio as a Biomarker to Predict Colonization Resistance and Inflammatory Response to Salmonella enteritidis Infection in Chicken.	Salmonella causes significant economic loss to the poultry industry and represents a real threat to human health. The region of difference 21 (ROD21) pathogenicity island removal is a genetic mechanism by which Salmonellaenteritidis (SE) invades the intestinal epithelium and induces systemic infection in mice. The heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio reflects the chicken's robustness and immune system status. The H/L ratio is considered a disease resistance trait, and it could be used as a marker for selecting Salmonella resistance in live chickens. However, the association of the H/L ratio with Salmonella resistance and the inflammatory response remains to be elucidated. Moreover, the kinetics of ROD21 excision in the intestine and immune organs of chickens is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the bacterial load, the ROD21 excision, the IL-1β, IL-8, and INF-γ blood serum concentration kinetics, and the association with the H/L ratio in chicken at 1, 3, 7, and 21 days post-SE infection. The results showed a significant correlation between the  H/L ratio and the bacterial load in the ileum and caecum at 7 dpi. The ROD21 pathogenicity island absolute and relative excision in the caecum were positively correlated at 1 dpi but negatively correlated at 7 dpi with the H/L ratio. However, in the liver, we found the opposite tendency. The association of the H/L ratio with IL-1β, IL-8, and INF-γ blood serum concentrations showed that a low H/L ratio is correlated with increased IL-1β and INF-γ at 21 dpi. This study confirmed that the H/L ratio is associated with robustness and Salmonella-resistance in chicken. The methodology used in this study can separate individuals into susceptible and resistant and can help in the selection and breeding of Salmonella-resistant chickens.	0
35182101	Effects of Lean Pork on Microbiota and Microbial-Metabolite Trimethylamine-N-Oxide: A Randomized Controlled Non-Inferiority Feeding Trial Based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.	SCOPE: Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is a microbiota-dependent and primarily animal-protein-derived proatherogenic metabolite. The ecological impact of pork-the most popular animal protein worldwide-on the human microbiome, and in the physiological context of TMAO and other biogenic amines, remains unknown. Poultry being the recommended heart-healthier animal protein, we investigated-if  pork intake results in inferior-to-chicken TMAO-response while consuming a diet based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA). METHODS AND RESULTS: In a randomized, controlled, all-food-provided, crossover, feeding trial, healthy adults consumed 156 g day-1 of lean-pork or chicken (active-control) as primary proteins. Mixed-effect modeling shows pork as noninferior to chicken for circulating TMAO response and microbiota-generated essential TMAO-precursor-trimethylamine (97.5% CI, n = 36/protein). Markers of lipid metabolism, inflammation and oxidative stress, serum levels of betaine, choline, L-carnitine, composition and functional-capability of the microbiota, and association of baseline TMAO-levels with TMAO-response (both, r > 0.6, p = 0.0001) are nondistinguishable between the protein groups. TMAO reduction and similar shifts in microbiota and biogenic-amine signatures postdiet in both groups indicate a background DGA-effect. CONCLUSION: Unlike extrapolating negative results, this study presents noninferiority-testing based evidence. Consuming pork as a predominant protein within an omnivorous DGA-diet does not exacerbate TMAO-response. Results highlight the importance of understanding protein-TMAO interactions within dietary patterns.	0
34481002	ALDH2, ADCY3 and BCMO1 polymorphisms and lifestyle-induced traits are jointly associated with CAD risk in Chinese Han people.	BACKGROUNDS: To investigate associations of genetic and environmental factors with coronary artery disease (CAD), we collected medical reports, lifestyle details, and blood samples of 2113 individuals, and then used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-ligase detection reaction (LDR) to genotype the targeted 102 SNPs. METHODS: We adopted elastic net algorithm to build an association model that considered simultaneously genetic and lifestyle/clinical factors associated with  CAD in Chinese Han population. RESULTS: In this study, we developed an all covariates-based model to explain the risk of CAD, which incorporated 8 lifestyle/clinical factors and a gene-score variable calculated from 3 significant SNPs (rs671, rs6751537 and rs11641677), attaining an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.71. It was found that, in terms of genetic variants, the AA genotype of rs671 in the additive (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.51, p = 0.008) and recessive (adjusted OR = 2.12, p = 0.021)  models, the GG genotype of rs6751537 in the additive (adjusted OR = 3.36, p = 0.001) and recessive (adjusted OR = 3.47, p = 0.001) models were associated with increased risk of CAD, while GG genotype of rs11641677 in additive model (adjusted OR = 0.39, p = 0.044) was associated with decreased risk of CAD. In terms of lifestyle/clinical factors, the history of hypertension (unadjusted OR = 2.37, p < 0.001) and dyslipidemia (unadjusted OR = 1.82, p = 0.007), age (unadjusted OR = 1.07, p < 0.001) and waist circumference (unadjusted OR = 1.02,  p = 0.05) would significantly increase the risk of CAD, while height (unadjusted  OR = 0.97, p = 0.006) and regular intake of chicken (unadjusted OR = 0.78, p = 0.008) reduced the risk of CAD. A significantinteraction was foundbetween rs671 and dyslipidemia (the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) = 3.36, p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: In this study, we constructed an association model and identified a set of SNPs and lifestyle/clinical risk factors of CAD in Chinese Han population. By considering both genetic and non-genetic risk factors, the built model may provide implications for CAD pathogenesis and clues for screening tool development in Chinese Han population.	0
35123157	Investigating the cecal microbiota in broiler poultry farms and its potential relationships with animal welfare.	The present study assessed the modulation of cecal microbiota and correlations with Campylobacter colonization and animal welfare status. For these purposes, we conducted a cross sectional study of the cecal microbiota from 187 broilers reared in 13 batches from 10 poultry farms by performing 16S rRNA sequencing (regions V3-4). The welfare of each batch was assessed using a simplified Welfare Quality® protocol, scoring higher in organic batches, compared to both antibiotic-free and conventional batches. The bioinformatics analyses were conducted in QIIME 2 and a linear discriminant analysis determined the association between microbiota and animals with different Campylobacter carriage  status and welfare levels. In the microbiota from the subjects negative for Campylobacter or with high welfare scores, Bacteroidetes was the predominant phylum with the genus Megamonas significantly increased in abundance. A greater abundance of Parabacteroides, Phascolarctobacterium, Helicobacter in poultry negative for Campylobacter was also found at the genus level. Animals with the lowest welfare scores showed an increased abundance of Proteobacteria. The results suggested a different microbial composition and diversity in the analyzed groups.	0
35405643	Prevalence of Chagas Disease and Associated Factors in an Endemic Area of Northeastern Argentina.	Chagas disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, remains one of the leading public health problems in Latin America. The number of infections in nonendemic countries continues to rise as a consequence of migratory flows. Updated information on prevalence, especially in treatable stages, together with vector eradication programs are key factors in an attempt to control the disease. We aim to estimate the prevalence of T. cruzi infection in an endemic area of Argentina  and to describe epidemiological and clinical factors related to the disease. This is a cross-sectional study in an endemic rural area of Argentina. Our target population was people between 10 and 20 years of age, collecting demographic, clinical, and electrocardiographic data and seroprevalence against T. cruzi. We included 460 subjects; 76.7% did not have drinking water; 49.3% reported the presence of Triatoma infestans at home; 79.1% had pets or birds; 72.6% lived close to a chicken coop; 24.6% lived in adobe houses; 27.8% lived in overcrowded  conditions. Seroprevalence was 9.33%. In the multivariate analysis, the presence  of Triatoma infestans at home (OR 2.08, P = 0.03) had an association with seropositivity. No relevant findings indicating acute or chronic organ involvement were detected. We found no correlation of right bundle branch block (RBBB) and Chagas disease in our population. None of the infected patients were previously aware of their condition, highlighting the importance of active surveillance to detect infection in a potentially treatable stage, especially in  areas with difficult access to health programs.	0
35068105	Immune Responses and B Complex Associated Resistance to Infectious Bronchitis Virus in Chickens.	Infectious bronchitis (IB) continues to be a global threat to poultry producers.  The chicken major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or chicken B complex is compact, restricted to a single chromosome, and approximately 20-fold smaller than the mammalian MHC. Abundant evidence indicates that the B complex is strongly associated with resistance to various infectious agents in chickens. While an association between different B haplotypes and resistance against several bacterial and viral diseases has been established, additional work needs  to be performed on the association between the B complex and resistance to IB viruses (IBV). Here, some of the available knowledge on genetic resistance to viral poultry diseases conferred by the chicken B locus is reviewed. IBV immune responses and resistance associated with differing B haplotype chicken lines are  reviewed and discussed herein.	0
34504482	Characterization of a Potent New-Generation Antimicrobial Peptide of Bacillus.	An antimicrobial peptide [Bacillus antimicrobial peptide (BAMP)] produced by Bacillus paralicheniformis was isolated from the Indian traditional fermented food and characterized. The antimicrobial peptide BAMP showed many unique features such as thermostability (4.0-125°C), pH tolerance (pH 2.0-9.0), and resistance to physiological enzymes (trypsin, chymotrypsin, pepsin, proteinase K, protease, and catalase), and food-grade metal salts do not inhibit the activity.  The broad spectrum of BAMP (antimicrobial activity) makes it a suitable candidate for food preservation as well as antimicrobial therapy. BAMP was found to exhibit a bacteriostatic effect on Salmonella typhi and controls the viability of Listeria monocytogenes in chicken meat efficiently. BAMP was found to establish eubiosis, as it is not antagonistic to Lactobacillus. Its non-hemolytic nature makes it suitable for therapy. Various genome prediction tools were adopted and applied to understand their localization, gene arrangement, and type of antimicrobials. Founded on its superior functional attributes, BAMP is a potent new-generation antimicrobial peptide.	0
34852967	MiR-29b-1-5p regulates the proliferation and differentiation of chicken primary myoblasts and analysis of its effective targets.	Several recent studies investigated the role of the miR-29 family in muscle development. However, only a few studies focused on chicken skeletal muscle. In the present study, cell cycle, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), and other assays indicated that miR-29b-1-5p can inhibit the proliferation of chicken primary myoblasts (CPMs); the western blot assay and immunofluorescence detection of MYHC demonstrated that miR-29b-1-5p can promote the differentiation of myoblasts. The functional enrichment analysis revealed that the target genes of miR-29b-1-5p may be involved in muscle tissue development, muscle organ development, and striated muscle tissue development, which are biological processes related to muscle development. The correlation analysis showed that these 6 genes, that is, ankyrin repeat domain 9 (ANKRD9), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), transcription factor 12 (TCF12), FAT atypical cadherin 1 (FAT1), lin-9 homolog (LIN9), and integrin beta 3 binding protein (ITGB3BP), can be used as effective candidate target genes of miR-29b-1-5p. Moreover, miR-29b-1-5p inhibits the expression of ANKRD9 by directly binding the  3'UTR of ANKRD9. Overall, these data indicate that miR-29b-1-5p inhibits the proliferation of primary chicken myoblasts, stimulates their differentiation, and is involved in the process of muscle development and that its effective target gene is ANKRD9. This study identified the molecular mechanism of miR-29b-1-5p in  chicken muscle development.	0
34928784	Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene: molecular characterization, expression  analysis and association of polymorphisms with egg production traits in goose (Anser cygnoides).	Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) belongs to the member of the insulin-like growth factors family, which plays key roles in animal growth, differentiation and proliferation, as well as reproduction and the regulation of ovarian follicle development. However, little is known about the goose IGF2 gene. In this study, a 1879 bp fragment that covered the complete coding region (CDS) of goose IGF2 cDNA was identified for the first time. The cDNA consists of an open reading frame of  574 nucleotides with the capacity to encode a prepro-IGF-II protein of 187 amino  acids, which comprises a signal peptide (24 residues), IGF-II peptide (67 residues), and C-terminal peptide (96 residues), and is closely related to that of chicken. qPCR indicates that the goose IGF2 mRNA is differentially expressed in all examined tissues of fertilized eggs (28 days) and laying Zhedong White geese (270 days). Two novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected  in exon 1 (G63A, Chr2: G26541617A) and intron 1 (G38A, Chr2: G26541479A) regions, and the synonymous mutation G63A showed a significant association with egg numbers (E180d) of Sanhua goose population (p < 0.05). All the information derived from this study could be valuable and facilitate further studies on the functions of goose IGF2 gene.	0
34512716	The Potential of Toll-Like Receptors to Modulate Avian Immune System: Exploring the Effects of Genetic Variants and Phytonutrients.	Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pathogen recognition receptors, and primitive sources of innate immune response that also play key roles in the defense mechanism against infectious diseases. About 10 different TLRs have been discovered in chicken that recognize ligands and participate in TLR signaling pathways. Research findings related to TLRs revealed new approaches to understand the fundamental mechanisms of the immune system, patterns of resistance against diseases, and the role of TLR-specific pathways in nutrient metabolism in chicken. In particular, the uses of specific feed ingredients encourage molecular biologists to exploit the relationship between nutrients (including different phytochemicals) and TLRs to modulate immunity in chicken. Phytonutrients and prebiotics are noteworthy dietary components to promote immunity and the production of disease-resistant chicken. Supplementations of yeast-derived products have also been extensively studied to enhance innate immunity during the last decade. Such interventions pave the way to explore nutrigenomic approaches for healthy and profitable chicken production. Additionally, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in TLRs have shown potential association with few disease outbreaks in chickens. This review aimed to provide insights into the key roles of TLRs in  the immune response and discuss the potential applications of these TLRs for genomic and nutritional interventions to improve health, and resistance against different fatal diseases in chicken.	0
35278017	A carvacrol-based product reduces Campylobacter jejuni load and alters microbiota composition in the caeca of chickens.	AIM: This study was conducted to test the ability of a carvacrol-based formulation (Phodé, France) to decrease the C. jejuni caecal load in inoculated broiler chickens and to study the impact of the C. jejuni inoculation alone or combined with the product, on the caecal microbiota. METHODS AND RESULTS: On day 1, chickens were either fed a control feed or the same diet supplemented with a carvacrol-based product. On day 21, the carvacrol-supplemented chickens and half of the non-supplemented chickens were inoculated with C. jejuni (108  CFU). Quantitative PCR was used to quantify C. jejuni in chicken caecal samples and 16S rRNA gene sequencing was carried out at  25, 31 and 35 days of age. A significant decrease of 1.4 log of the C. jejuni caecal load was observed in 35-day-old chickens supplemented with the product, compared to the inoculated and unsupplemented group (p < 0.05). The inoculation with C. jejuni significantly increased the population richness, Shannon and Simpson diversity and altered beta-diversity. Compared to the control group, the  C. jejuni inoculation causes significant changes in the microbiota. The carvacrol-based product associated with C. jejuni inoculation increased the diversity and strongly modified the structure of the microbial community. Functional analysis by 16S rRNA gene-based predictions further revealed that the  product up-regulated the pathways involved in the antimicrobial synthesis, which  could explain its shaping effect on the caecal microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed the impairment of the caecal bacterial community after inoculation and demonstrated the ability of the product to reduce the C. jejuni load in chickens. Further investigations are needed to better understand the mode of action of this product to promote the installation of a beneficial microbiota to its host. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Results suggested that this product could be promising to control C. jejuni contamination of broilers.	0
35276495	In pursuit of a better broiler: tibial morphology, breaking strength, and ash content in conventional and slower-growing strains of broiler chickens.	This study was conducted to determine the differences in bone traits in 14 strains of broiler chickens differing in growth rate. The strains encompassed 2 conventional (CONV; ADG0-48 >60 g/d) and 12 slower-growing (SG) strains classified as FAST (ADG0-62 = 53-55 g/d), MOD (ADG0-62 = 50-51 g/d), and SLOW (ADG0-62 <50 g/d), with 4 strains represented in each SG category. A total of 7,216 mixed-sex birds were equally allocated into 164 pens (44 birds/pen; 30 kg/m2) in a randomized incomplete block design, with each strain represented in 8 to 12 pens over 2-3 trials. From each pen, 4 birds (2 males and 2 females) were individually weighed and euthanized at 2 target weights (TWs) according to their  time to reach approximately 2.1 kg (TW1: 34 d for CONV and 48 d for SG strains) and 3.2 kg (TW2: 48 d for CONV and 62 d for SG strains). Tibiae samples were dissected, and length and diameter were recorded. Left tibiae were used for tibial breaking strength (TBS) at both TWs and tibial ash at TW2. At TW1, CONV birds' tibiae were narrowest and shortest (P < 0.001), yet had similar TBS compared to the other categories (P > 0.69). At TW2, category (P > 0.50) had no effect on tibial diameter, yet CONV birds had the shortest tibiae (P < 0.001). The CONV birds had greater TBS:BW ratio than FAST and MOD birds at both TWs 1 and 2 (P < 0.039) and similar ash content as the other categories at TW2 (P > 0.220). At 48 d of age, CONV birds had the greatest absolute TBS (P < 0.003), yet lower TBS:BW ratio than SLOW birds (P < 0.001). Tibiae from CONV birds were longer than MOD and SLOW birds, and thicker in diameter than the other categories, yet CONV birds had the lowest dimensions relative to BW (P < 0.001) at 48 d, indicating a  negative association between accelerated growth and tibial dimensions. These results indicate that differences in functional abilities among categories may be due to differences in morphometric traits rather than differences in bone strength and mineralization.	0
35334925	Efficacy of the Nutritional Risk Index, Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index, BMI, and GLIM-Defined Malnutrition in Predicting Survival of Patients with Head and Neck Cancer Patients Qualified for Home Enteral Nutrition.	Malnutrition is a poor prognostic factor in cancer disease. In case of head and neck cancer, there are multiple disease symptoms and side effects of treatment that increase the risk of malnutrition. The aim of the study is to assess the association between nutritional status at the time of qualification for home enteral nutrition (HEN) and overall survival of patients with head and neck cancer (HNC), and assessment usefulness of selected nutritional indices as prognostic factors. The retrospective survival analysis involved 157 patients with HNC referred to HEN between January 2018 and October 2021. The nutritional status assessment was performed at the qualification for HEN visit. We have analyzed results of body mass index (BMI), Nutritional Risk Index (NRI) for patients &lt;65 years, Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) for patients ≥65 years and malnutrition defined by Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM). The mean patient survival was 44.7 weeks and the median was 23.9 weeks. Patients with low NRI and GNRI score had a higher risk of death (NRI: p = 0.0229; GNRI: p = 0.371). NRI, GNRI, and malnutrition defined by GLIM were superior to BMI as prognostic markers for survival. Results suggest that the use of NRI, GNRI, and GLIM criteria could provide useful prognostic information. The longer survival since the qualifying visit for home enteral nutrition suggests that nutritional management could be initiated earlier.	0
35175959	Restricted dietary pattern may contribute to lowering blood pressure in adolescents with obesity: Study of Cardiovascular Risk in Adolescents.	OBJECTIVE: Dieting is one of the main target factors for interventions that seek  to control and prevent rising blood pressure. This study identified dietary patterns and analyzed their association with adolescents' blood pressure. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study with a probabilistic and nationally representative sample of adolescents aged 12-17 years, who participated in the Study of Cardiovascular Risk in Adolescents (ERICA), carried out in 2013-2014 with Brazilian adolescents (N = 36 956). Food consumption was assessed by 24 h recall. Dietary patterns were identified using the Reduced Rank Regression method, and considering waist circumference, fasting insulin, and dietary polyunsaturated fat/saturated fat ratio as intermediate variables. Multiple linear regression models stratified by weight were developed; SBP and DBP were the dependent variables, and dietary pattern scores were the independent ones, with adjustment for potential confounding factors. RESULTS: The following patterns were identified: 'Brazilian common', 'Restricted' and 'Added sugar'. The 'Restricted' pattern, which included diet/light foods, chicken and chicken-based dishes, leafy greens, vegetables and spices, red meats  and dishes based on red meats and tubers, was inversely associated with SBP (β = -1.55; 95% CI = -2.26 to -0.83) and DBP (β = -1.19; 95% CI = -1.70 to -0.68) in adolescents with obesity. CONCLUSION: In adolescents with obesity, a low-energy density diet was associated with reduced blood pressure. These findings are consistent with international recommendations for preventing elevated blood pressure.	0
34585996	Pigment concentrations in eggshell and their related gene expressions in uterus of Changshun blue eggshell chickens.	1. The goal of this study was to investigate the colour diversity of egg shells and expression of related genes in the uterus of chickens that produce eggs of different colours.2. Four colour types of Changshun blue-shell chickens, producing dark or light blue, greenish-brown and brown shelled eggs, were selected. The eggshell pigment concentration and colour values in each group were examined. The relative gene expression of solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1C1 (SLCO1C1), ferrochelatase (FECH), haem oxygenase 1  (HO-1), ovotransferrin (OF) and biliverdin reductase A (BLVRA) in eggshell gland  were measured.3. The Δb, ΔE and protoporphyrin in brown and greenish-brown groups were significantly higher in the blue egg group (P < 0.01), whereas ΔL was significantly lower than that in the blue eggs (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in biliverdin concentration between the brown and blue groups.4. The Δa values, in descending order, were 8.27 ± 2.76 in the brown, -3.79 ± 2.39 in the greenish-brown and -7.29 ± 2.27 in the blue groups, respectively. The relative expression of HO-1 in the greenish-brown and light blue groups was significantly higher than in the dark blue and brown groups. The  relative expression of FECH in the light blue group was significantly lower than  that in the dark blue, greenish-brown or brown group (P < 0.01). The relative expression of HO-1 and BLVRA genes in the dark blue group was significantly higher than that in the light blue, greenish-brown and the brown group (P < 0.01).5. The Δa might provide a better index than protoporphyrin and biliverdin contents for eggshell colour breeding. Overall, HO-1 as well as BLVRA  were important candidate genes for the selection of dark blue eggs.	0
34954808	The light response in chickens divergently selected for feather pecking behavior  reveals mechanistic insights towards psychiatric disorders.	BACKGROUND: Feather pecking is a serious behavioral disorder in chickens that has a considerable impact on animal welfare and poses an economic burden for poultry  farming. To study the underlying genetics of feather pecking animals were divergently selected for feather pecking over 15 generations based on estimated breeding values for the behavior. METHODS AND RESULTS: By characterizing the transcriptomes of whole brains isolated from high and low feather pecking chickens in response to light stimulation we discovered a putative dysregulation of micro RNA processing caused by a lack of Dicer1. This results in a prominent downregulation of the GABRB2 gene and other GABA receptor transcripts, which might cause a constant high level of excitation in the brains of high feather pecking chickens. Moreover, our results point towards an increase in immune system-related transcripts that may be caused by higher interferon concentrations due to Dicer1 downregulation. CONCLUSION: Based on our results, we conclude that feather pecking in chickens and schizophrenia in humans have numerous common features. For instance, a Dicer1 dependent disruption of miRNA biogenesis and the lack of GABRB2 expression have been linked to schizophrenia pathogenesis. Furthermore, disturbed circadian rhythms and dysregulation of genes involved in the immune system are common features of both conditions.	0
34460062	Genomic organization and hypoxia inducible factor responsive regulation of teleost hsp90β gene during hypoxia stress.	BACKGROUND: The physiological significance of a large family of heat-shock proteins (HSPs), comprised of the cytosolic HSP90A and the endoplasmic reticulum  component of HSPB, is evident in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The HSP90A is believed to play critical roles in diverse physiological functions of cell viability and chromosomal stability including stress management. Heightened abundance of hsp90β transcript was documented in Channa striatus, a freshwater fish, which is capable of surviving within an extremely hypoxic environment. METHODS AND RESULTS: To better understand the mechanism of hsp90β gene expression, we investigated its genomic organization. Eleven exons were identified, including a long upstream intron with a remarkable similarity with human, but not with chicken counterpart. Dual-luciferase assays identified promoter activity in a 1366 bp 5'-flanking segment beyond the transcription initiation site. Examination detected a minimal promoter of 754 bp containing a TATA-box, CAAT-enhancer in addition to providing clues regarding other enhancer and repressor elements. The driving capability of this minimal promoter was further validated by its binding ability with TATA-box binding protein and the generation of GFP expressing transgenic zebrafish (F2). Further, deletion of an inverted HIF (hypoxia inducible factor) motif RCGTG (upstream of the TATA-box) dramatically reduced luciferase expression in a hypoxic environment (CoCl2 treated cultivable cells) and was identified as a cis-acting HIF responsive element, necessary for the hypoxia-induced expression. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained herein provide an insight regarding how hsp90β  gene expression is controlled by HIF responsive element in teleost both during hypoxia stress management and normal physiological functions, and suggested that  the hsp90β gene promoter could be used as a potential candidate for generating ornamental and food-fish transgenics.	0
35268126	Identification and Protective Efficacy of Eimeria tenella Rhoptry Kinase Family Protein 17.	Eimeria tenella encodes a genome of approximately 8000 genes. To date, however, very few data are available regarding E. tenella rhoptry kinase family proteins.  In the present study, the gene fragment encoding the mature peptide of the rhoptry kinase family protein 17 of E. tenella (EtROP17) was amplified by PCR and expressed in E. coli. Then, we generated polyclonal antibodies that recognize EtROP17 and investigated the expression of EtROP17 in the merozoite stage of E. tenella by immunofluorescent staining and Western blot analysis. Meanwhile, the protective efficacy of rEtROP17 against E. tenella was evaluated in chickens. Sequencing analysis showed that a single base difference at sequence position 1901 was observed between the SD-01 strain and the Houghton strain. EtROP17 was expressed in the merozoite stage of E. tenella. The results of the animal challenge experiments demonstrated that vaccination with rEtROP17 significantly reduced cecal lesions and oocyst outputs compared with the challenged control group. Our findings indicate that EtROP17 could serve as a potential candidate for developing a new vaccine against E. tenella.	0
34573562	RNA Profiles of the Korat Chicken Breast Muscle with Increased Carnosine Content  Produced through Dietary Supplementation with β-Alanine or L-Histidine.	Korat chicken (KRC) is a slow-growing chicken bred in Thailand, whose meat exhibits a unique toughness. A previous study produced KRC breast meat containing high carnosine content through dietary supplementation with β-alanine or L-histidine; however, the KRC that were fed an L-histidine-supplemented diet produced meat that was significantly more tender. Herein, we performed RNA-Seq to identify candidate genes involved in the regulation of carnosine content and meat toughness. Total RNA was isolated from five female KRC breast muscles in each treatment group that KRC fed diets without supplementation, supplemented with β-alanine or L-histidine. Compared to the non-supplemented group, we identified 118 and 198 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the β-alanine or L-histidine supplementation groups, respectively. Genes potentially related to meat tenderness-i.e., those regulating myosin, collagen, intramuscular fat, and calpain-were upregulated (LOC107051274, ACSBG1, and CAPNS2) and downregulated (MYO7B, MYBPH, SERPINH1, and PGAM1). However, carnosine synthase gene was not identified. Functional enrichment analysis identified pathways affected by dietary supplementation, including the insulin signaling pathway (β-alanine supplementation) and the insulin resistance and adipocytokine signaling pathways  (L-histidine supplementation). The FoxO signaling pathway was identified as a regulatory network for both supplementation groups. The identified genes can be used as molecular markers of meat tenderness in slow-growing chickens.	0
35310118	Diagnostic Laparoscopy for Ovarian Tumor Due to Salmonella Infection.	Ovarian abscess is thought to be caused by ascending infection. We experienced a  case with ovarian abscess caused by Salmonella. The patient had been monitored for endometrial cysts at an outpatient clinic. She visited our hospital emergently with chief complaints of persistent fever and diarrhea. Although sexually transmitted disease was not suspected, she was diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease due to her high C-reactive protein (CRP) level and started antibacterial treatment. Two days later, diagnostic laparoscopy was performed for persisting CRP elevation, and she was diagnosed with ovarian abscesses due to Salmonella infection. As the patient had regularly eaten soft-boiled eggs and chicken, an association with her eating habits was strongly suspected as a cause. When a patient has symptoms of enteritis, preceding tubo-ovarian abscess should be considered the possibility of Salmonella infection. Early diagnosis and treatment are necessary for fertility preservation, and minimally invasive diagnostic laparoscopy is useful.	0
34988376	Association of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) gene polymorphism with the reproductive performance of three dual-purpose chicken breeds.	The study was designed to investigate the association of Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) gene polymorphism with the reproductive performance of FUNAAB-Alpha, Sasso, and Kuroiler dual-purpose chicken breeds. To achieve this, a total of 250 healthy hens were selected at 12 wk of age and were intensively managed in cages for 52 wk. Blood sample was taken from each chicken at the 34th  week and genomic DNA was extracted using Qiagentm DNA extraction kit, PCR was used to amplify the DNA fragments, and the PCR products were electrophoresed. Amplicons obtained were digested with restriction enzyme hinf1, and were further  electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gel. Data obtained were analyzed using the General linear model of SAS (2002) version 9.0 to determine the effect of IGF1 gene polymorphism and the distribution of alleles within the breeds. Results show polymorphism of the IGF1 gene and the restriction analysis indicated two alleles; A 58% and C 42% with the identification of genotypes AA, AC, and CC, and genotypic frequency of 22%, 43%, and 35%, respectively. Significant associations  were observed between the polymorphism of the IGF1 gene, age of the bird at first lay, and weight of the hen at first lay. Chickens with haplotype CC came earlier  into lay compared to those with the other two haplotypes (AA and AC). Therefore,  the study suggests that haplotype CC could be used as a genetic marker to select  for an improved laying performance in chickens.	0
35090599	Mapping the invisible chromatin transactions of prophase chromosome remodeling.	We have used a combination of chemical genetics, chromatin proteomics, and imaging to map the earliest chromatin transactions during vertebrate cell entry into mitosis. Chicken DT40 CDK1as cells undergo synchronous mitotic entry within  15 min following release from a 1NM-PP1-induced arrest in late G2. In addition to changes in chromatin association with nuclear pores and the nuclear envelope, earliest prophase is dominated by changes in the association of ribonucleoproteins with chromatin, particularly in the nucleolus, where pre-rRNA  processing factors leave chromatin significantly before RNA polymerase I. Nuclear envelope barrier function is lost early in prophase, and cytoplasmic proteins begin to accumulate on the chromatin. As a result, outer kinetochore assembly appears complete by nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD). Most interphase chromatin  proteins remain associated with chromatin until NEBD, after which their levels drop sharply. An interactive proteomic map of chromatin transactions during mitotic entry is available as a resource at https://mitoChEP.bio.ed.ac.uk.	0
34461467	Small-scale commercial chicken production: A risky business for farmers in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam.	Small-scale farming of meat chicken flocks using local native breeds contributes  to the economy of many rural livelihoods in Vietnam and many other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). These systems are also the target of high levels of antimicrobial use (AMU); however, little is known about the profitability and  sustainability of such systems. Since small-scale farms are commercial enterprises, this knowledge is essential to develop successful strategies to curb excessive AMU. Using longitudinal data from 203 small-scale (100-2,000 heads) native chicken flocks raised in 102 randomly selected farms in Dong Thap province (Mekong Delta, Vietnam), we investigated the financial and economic parameters of such systems and the main constraints to their sustainability. Feed accounted for the largest financial cost (flock median 49.5 % [Inter-quartile range (IQR) 41.5-61.8 %]) of total costs, followed by day-old-chicks (DOCs) (median 30.3 % [IQR 23.2-38.4 %]), non-antimicrobial health-supporting products (median 7.1 % [IQR 4.7-10.5 %]), vaccines (median 3.1 % [IQR 2.2-4.8 %]), equipment (median 1.9 % [IQR 0.0-4.9 %]) and antimicrobials (median 1.9 % [IQR 0.7-3.6 %]). Excluding labor costs, farmers achieved a positive return on investment (ROI) from 120 (59.1 %) flocks, the remainder generating a loss (median ROI 124 % [IQR 36-206 %]). Higher ROI was associated with higher flock size and low mortality. There was no statistical association between use of medicated feed and flock mortality  or chicken bodyweight. The median daily income per person dedicated to raising chickens was 202,100 VND, lower than alternative rural labor activities in the Mekong Delta. In a large proportion of farms (33.4 %), farmers decided to stop raising chickens after completing one cycle. Farmers who dropped off chicken production purchased more expensive feed (in 1000 VND per kg): 11.1 [10.6-11.5] vs. 10.8 [10.4-11.3] for farms that continued production (p = 0.039), and experienced higher chicken mortality (28.5 % [12.0-79.0 %] vs. 16 [7.5-33.0 %]; p = 0.004). The rapid turnover of farmers raising chickens in such systems represents a challenge to the uptake of messages on appropriate AMU and chicken health. To ensure sustainability of small-scale commercial systems, advisory services need to be available to farmers as they initiate new flocks, and support them in the early stages to help overcome their limited experience and skills. This targeted approach would support profitability whilst reducing risk of emergence of AMR and infectious disease from these systems.	0
34928895	Overactive Bladder or Anxiety: Which Came First?	"OBJECTIVE: Although available diagnostic criteria are intelligible, combination of OAB and anxiety in the same patient presents a perfect example of medical causality dilemma, commonly stated as the question: ""which came first: the chicken or the egg?"". The aim of this review article is to address available insights in bidirectional association between OAB and anxiety. METHODS: In this review article, we included different types of studies whose results are presented as relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) with a 95% accuracy. A literature search was conducted with the use of the PubMed and EMBASE electronic databases focusing on identifying articles published in English between 1990 and 2020. RESULTS: The electronic searches, after duplicate records removal, provided a total of 126 citations. Of these, 107 were excluded after title/abstract screening (not relevant to the review). We examined the full text of 19 publications remaining to summarize possible mechanisms between OAB and anxiety.  According to examined literature, our result synthesis provides insight in epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic and therapeutic approach of both conditions. CONCLUSION: Temporal relationship between OAB and anxiety is not very well documented because available longitudinal cohort studies are limited. The limitation of the published literature is that most were population-based symptom studies demonstrating high risk of bias. Although data from analysed studies suggest that anxiety and OAB and anxiety might be casually related, studies provided on clinical population are warranted. In addition to the traditional urologic factors, we recommend that psychosocial factors such as anxiety should be assessed routinely in patients with OAB."	0
34890302	Associations of CALM1 and DRD1 polymorphisms, and their expression levels, with Taihang chicken egg-production traits.	Egg production by hens is an important reproductive performance index in the poultry industry. To investigate the effects of the CALM1 and DRD1 genes on egg production in chicken, their mRNA expression and single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNP) levels were investigated, and bioinformatics and egg-production association analyses were performed. Three SNPs (g.44069941G > A and g.44069889A > G in CALM1 and g.10742639C > T in DRD1) were detected in the exons and introns of CALM1 and  DRD1 in 400 Taihang chickens. Among them, g.44069941G > A was significantly associated with Taihang chicken egg production on the 500th day (p < 0.05), whereas g.10742639C > T was significantly associated with the 300th day (p < 0.05). The expression levels of CALM1 and DRD1 in ovarian tissues of a high-yielding Taihang group were greater than in a low-yielding group (p < 0.05). The bioinformatics analysis revealed that the mutations influenced the mRNA secondary structures of CALM1 and DRD1. This study provides new insights into the potential effects of CALM1 and DRD1 polymorphisms on chicken egg production. The  two SNPs g.44069941G > A and g.10742639C > T are potential molecular markers for  improving the reproductive traits of Taihang chicken.	0
34816300	Evaluation of immunoprotective effects of recombinant proteins and DNA vaccines derived from Eimeria tenella surface antigen 6 and 15 in vivo.	Coccidiosis is an intestinal parasitic disease that causes huge economic losses to the poultry industry globally. Eimeria tenella belonging to protozoon is the causative agent of cecal coccidiosis in chicken, and it causes enormous damage to poultry industry. The surface antigens (SAGs) of apicomplexan parasites have functions of attachment and invasion in host-parasite interaction. As a result of parasitic invasion, host immune response is triggered. However, the immunogenicity and potency of E. tenella surface antigen 6 and 15 (EtSAG 6 and 15), as vaccinal candidate antigen, remain largely unknown. Therefore, gene fragments of E. tenella EtSAG 6 and 15 were amplified and transformed to pET28a prokaryotic vector for recombinant protein expression. The pEGFP-N1 eukaryotic vectors with EtSAG 6 and 15 amplification fragments (pEGFP-N1-EtSAG 5 and 16) were transformed into 293 T cell line. The results of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot analysis revealed successful expressions of EtSAG 6 and 15 in Escherichia coli and 293 T cells. Subsequently, animal experiments of 49 cobb broilers were performed to evaluate immunoprotection of recombinant proteins and DNA vaccines derived from E. tenella EtSAG 5 and 16 with an immunizing dose of 100 μg, respectively. Chickens vaccinated with rEtSAG 6 protein, rEtSAG 15 protein, pEGFP-N1-EtSAG 6 plasmid, or pEGFP-N1-EtSAG 15 plasmid showed no significant increase in IFN-γor interleukin-4 (IL-4) level compared with control groups. Chickens vaccinated with protein rEtSAG 6, protein rEtSAG 15, pEGFP-N1-EtSAG 6 plasmid, or pEGFP-N1-EtSAG  15 exhibited higher weight gains, lower oocyst output, and lower mean lesion scores, compared with infection control group. Among the four immunized groups, plasmid EGFP-N1-EtSAG 6 (100 μg) group exhibited the highest anticoccidial index  (ACI) value (150.20). Overall, plasmids EGFP-N1-EtSAG 6 and 15, as DNA vaccines,  provided a more effective immunoprotection for chickens against E. tenella than protein rEtSAG 6 and protein rEtSAG 15 as subunit vaccines. EtSAG 6 and 15 are promising candidate antigen genes for developing coccidiosis vaccine.	0
34475461	Indicators of the molecular pathogenesis of virulent Newcastle disease virus in chickens revealed by transcriptomic profiling of spleen.	Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has caused significant outbreaks in South-East Asia, particularly in Indonesia in recent years. Recently emerged genotype VII NDVs (NDV-GVII) have shifted their tropism from gastrointestinal/respiratory tropism to a lymphotropic virus, invading lymphoid organs including spleen and bursa of Fabricius to cause profound lymphoid depletion. In this study, we aimed  to identify candidate genes and biological pathways that contribute to the disease caused by this velogenic NDV-GVII. A transcriptomic analysis based on RNA-Seq of spleen was performed in chickens challenged with NDV-GVII and a control group. In total, 6361 genes were differentially expressed that included 3506 up-regulated genes and 2855 down-regulated genes. Real-Time PCR of ten selected genes validated the RNA-Seq results as the correlation between them is 0.98. Functional and network analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) showed altered regulation of ElF2 signalling, mTOR signalling, proliferation of cells of the lymphoid system, signalling by Rho family GTPases and synaptogenesis signalling in spleen. We have also identified modified expression of IFIT5, PI3K, AGT and PLP1 genes in NDV-GVII infected chickens. Our findings in activation of autophagy-mediated cell death, lymphotropic and synaptogenesis signalling pathways provide new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of this newly emerged NDV-GVII.	0
34471977	Epidemiology of Neospora caninum infection in free-range chickens (Gallus gallus  domesticus) in north central Mexico.	The objective of the present study was to investigate the epidemiology of natural infection by N. caninum in free-range chickens from Aguascalientes, Mexico, through identifying the presence of antibodies, its association with certain risk factors, and estimate the frequency of parasite DNA detection in the brain. The study included 150 clinically healthy chickens from 81 small family farms distributed throughout the state, from which blood and brain samples were taken.  Serum samples were processed by indirect immunofluorescence considering a dilution of 1:50 as a positive reaction, while the DNA detection was done by PCR; the association between the presence of antibodies and the potential risk factors was estimated through logistic regression. The general anti-N. caninum presence of antibodies in the studied population was 46% (69/150, CI 95% 38-54), with titers of 1:50 in 38, 1:100 in 24, and 1:200 in 7, finding positive cases in 49%  of the farms and in 91% of the municipalities that integrate the state. The presence of antibodies found in the municipalities was estimated in a range of 20 to 75%. The frequency of DNA detection was 6% (9/150, CI 95% 2-11). The grain supplementation was identified as the unique risk factor for infection (OR = 2.82; 95% CI, 1.18-6.73, p < 0.019).	0
34923247	Baculovirus-derived influenza virus-like particle confers complete protection against lethal H7N9 avian influenza virus challenge in chickens and mice.	Currently, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7N9 viruses still pose a potential pandemic threat. Influenza virus-like particle (VLP) is one of the most promising vaccine strategies to complement traditional egg-dependent vaccines. Here, we generated a H7N9 VLP vaccine candidate by baculovirus expression system  and evaluated its efficacy in chickens and mice. The H7N9 VLP was produced through co-infection of Sf9 insect cells with three recombinant baculoviruses expressing individual HA, NA and M1 gene of the HPAI H7N9 virus A/chicken/Guangdong/GD15/2016. Intramuscular immunization of the H7N9 VLP elicited robust antibody immune responses and conferred complete clinical protection against lethal H7N9 virus challenge both in chickens and mice. Meanwhile, H7N9 VLP significantly restrained virus shedding and dramatically alleviated pulmonary lesions caused by H7N9 virus infection in birds and mice. Interestingly, chicken antibodies induced by the H7N9 VLP also had a good cross-reactivity with H7N9 field strains isolated in different years. In addition, vaccination with the H7N9 VLP elicited high T cell immunity in mouse lung, evidenced by significantly upregulated expression of IL-2, IL-4 and IFN-γ.  Furthermore, the H7N9 VLP significantly decreased the expression of some key inflammatory cytokines, such as IL6, RANTES and TNF-α in mouse lung, which may partially account for its contribution to alleviate lung pathology. Therefore, our study describes the good efficacy of the HA + NA + M1-containing H7N9 VLP both in chicken and mice models, highlighting the potential of VLP-based vaccine  as a critical alternative of traditional egg-based vaccine for control of H7N9 influenza virus in both humans and poultry.	0
34600571	Microbial taxa in dust and excreta associated with the productive performance of  commercial meat chicken flocks.	BACKGROUND: A major focus of research on the gut microbiota of poultry has been to define signatures of a healthy gut and identify microbiota components that correlate with feed conversion. However, there is a high variation in individual  gut microbiota profiles and their association with performance. Population level  samples such as dust and pooled excreta could be useful to investigate bacterial  signatures associated with productivity at the flock-level. This study was designed to investigate the bacterial signatures of high and low-performing commercial meat chicken farms in dust and pooled excreta samples. Poultry house dust and fresh pooled excreta were collected at days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 of age  from 8 farms of two Australian integrator companies and 389 samples assessed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. The farms were ranked as low (n = 4)  or high performers (n = 4) based on feed conversion rate corrected by body weight. RESULTS: Permutational analysis of variance based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities  using abundance data for bacterial community structure results showed that company explained the highest variation in the bacterial community structure in excreta (R2 = 0.21, p = 0.001) while age explained the highest variation in the bacterial community structure in dust (R2 = 0.13, p = 0.001). Farm performance explained the least variation in the bacterial community structure in both dust (R2 = 0.03, p = 0.001) and excreta (R2 = 0.01, p = 0.001) samples. However, specific bacterial taxa were found to be associated with high and low performance in both dust and excreta. The bacteria taxa associated with high-performing farms in dust or excreta found in this study were Enterococcus and Candidatus Arthromitus whereas bacterial taxa associated with low-performing farms included  Nocardia, Lapillococcus, Brachybacterium, Ruania, Dietzia, Brevibacterium, Jeotgalicoccus, Corynebacterium and Aerococcus. CONCLUSIONS: Dust and excreta could be useful for investigating bacterial signatures associated with high and low performance in commercial poultry farms.  Further studies on a larger number of farms are needed to determine if the bacterial signatures found in this study are reproducible.	0
34546051	Searching for Hydrodynamic Orienting Effects in the Association of Tri-N-acetylglucosamine with Hen Egg-White Lysozyme.	Using stopped-flow fluorometry, we determined rate constants for the formation of diffusional encounter complexes of tri-N-acetylglucosamine (NAG3) with hen egg-white lysozyme (kaWT) and its double mutant Asp48Asn/Lys116Gln (kaMT). We defined binding anisotropy, κ ≡ (kaWT - kaMT)/(kaWT + kaMT), and determined its ionic strength dependence. Our goal was to check if this ionic strength dependence provides information about the orienting hydrodynamic effects in the ligand-binding process. We also computed ionic strength dependence of the binding anisotropy from Brownian dynamics simulations using simple models of the lysozyme-NAG3 system. The results of our experiments indicate that in the case of lysozyme and NAG3 such hydrodynamic orienting effects are rather negligible. On the other hand, the results of our Brownian dynamics simulations prove that there exist molecular systems for which such orienting effects are substantial. However, the ionic strength dependence of the rate constants for the wild-type and modified systems do not exhibit any qualitative features that would allow us  to conclude the presence of hydrodynamic orienting effects from stopped-flow experiments alone. Nevertheless, the results of our simulations suggest the presence of hydrodynamic orienting effects in the receptor-ligand association when the anisotropy of binding depends on the solvent viscosity.	0
34650121	Transcriptomics of chicken cecal tonsils and intestine after infection with low pathogenic avian influenza virus H9N2.	Influenza viruses cause severe respiratory infections in humans and birds, triggering global health concerns and economic burden. Influenza infection is a dynamic process involving complex biological host responses. The objective of this study was to illustrate global biological processes in ileum and cecal tonsils at early time points after chickens were infected with low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) H9N2 through transcriptome analysis. Total RNA isolated from ileum and cecal tonsils of non-infected and infected layers at 12-, 24- and 72-h post-infection (hpi) was used for mRNA sequencing analyses to characterize differentially expressed genes and overrepresented pathways. Statistical analysis highlighted transcriptomic signatures significantly occurring 24 and 72 hpi, but not earlier at 12 hpi. Interferon (IFN)-inducible and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression was increased, followed by continued expression of various heat-shock proteins (HSP), including HSP60, HSP70, HSP90 and HSP110. Some upregulated genes involved in innate antiviral responses included DDX60, MX1, RSAD2 and CMPK2. The ISG15 antiviral mechanism pathway was highly enriched in ileum and cecal tonsils at 24 hpi. Overall, most affected pathways were related to interferon production and the heat-shock response. Research on these candidate genes and pathways is warranted to decipher underlying mechanisms of immunity against LPAIV in chickens.	0
35421830	Construction and immune efficacy of a recombinant turkey herpesvirus vaccine strain expressing fusion protein of genotype VII Newcastle disease virus.	Herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT), a commonly used live vaccine against Marek's disease, has proven to be a highly effective viral vector for the generation of recombinant vaccines that deliver protective antigens of other avian pathogens. In this study, a vaccine designated rHVT-NDV-opti F was constructed by inserting  a codon-optimized genotype Ⅶ Newcastle disease virus (NDV) fusion (F) gene into the US2 gene of HVT Fc126 vaccine strain using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology coupled with two single-guide RNAs (sgRNA). The F protein expression of rHVT-NDV-opti F was detectable by western blotting and an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Compared with wildtype HVT, rHVT-NDV-opti F has similar plaque morphology but lower in vitro replication capacity. The F protein of rHVT-NDV-opti F is genetically stable and predominantly expressed in the cell plasma. Immunization of one-day-old specific pathogen-free chickens with 4000 plaque-forming units of rHVT-NDV-opti F induced NDV-specific antibodies and provided 70% protection against a homologous NDV challenge, effectively reducing  virus shedding, clinical signs, tissue viral load, and mortality. These results suggest that rHVT-NDV-opti F could be a potential vaccine candidate against Newcastle disease in chickens and that HDR-CRISPR/Cas9 combined with dual sgRNA can rapidly and efficiently construct HVT-vectored vaccine candidates.	0
35237677	Smallholder Broiler Farmers' Characteristics to Uptake Measures Against Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Western Java.	Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 remains endemic in the Western Java smallholder broiler farms. This study aims to identify farmers and farm characteristics associated with farmers' motivations toward five different measures directed to HPAI: cleaning and disinfection (C&D), vaccination, reporting, and stamping-out with and without compensation. Through multi-stage sampling and a questionnaire, we collected data from 199 farmers in Western Java  and applied descriptive analysis and logistic regression to evaluate the data. Most smallholder broiler farms had a production contract with a poultry company.  Unexpectedly, we identified subtypes of price-contract (i.e., revenues based on contract selling price and live bird weight) and makloon-contract (i.e., revenues based on management fee per bird) schemes. We identified these new subtypes as extended price-contract and extended makloon-contract schemes. These extended subtypes included issues related to animal health management and payment schemes. The results show that most of the farmers in both extended types were highly motivated to implement C&D and vaccination. Business types and farmers' awareness of HPAI were significantly associated with a farmer's motivation to implement C&D. Farmers who had an awareness of HPAI were more likely to implement C&D. Although our models were insufficient to model the association of farmers' motivation to uptake preventive measures against HPAI in Western Java, this study identified significant characteristics that help improve HPAI control policy in Western Java. Our study suggests that farm business types and incentives through  payment schemes and training may increase the uptake of preventive measures by farmers.	0
34883322	Ascaridia galli challenge model for worm propagation in young chickens with or without immunosuppression.	With the continued growth of free-range egg production, the importance of the chicken roundworm Ascaridia galli is increasing. Investigations into this parasite would be facilitated by the availability of characterised strains and clear guidelines on optimal methods of multiplication and maintenance. Currently, there is lack of well-defined in vivo models for maintaining A. galli and the potential of using host immunosuppression to boost parasite development and worm  egg output has not been investigated. To determine the most efficient way of propagating A. galli in young chickens an experiment with a 2 × 3 × 4 × 2 factorial design involving age of chicken at infection (day-old or 14 days old),  immunosuppression (dexamethasone (DEX), cyclophosphamide (CY) or sham), infective egg dose (0, 100, 300 or 900 embryonated eggs/bird) and time of worm recovery after infection (8 or 10 weeks post-infection) was conducted. The experiment used a total of 384 layer cockerel chicks. Infection was delivered orally in 3 split doses over one week and immunosuppressants were administered by intramuscular injection concurrently with the infections. Body weight, excreta egg counts, intestinal worm count and worm establishment rate were assessed. The only sign of ascaridiosis noted was mild diarrhoea at the time of slaughter in some birds with a significant- positive association with worm count. Infection caused a significant dose dependent reduction in body weight in non-immunosuppressed birds but this effect was ameliorated by immunosuppression. Age at infection had no significant effect on the studied variables although both worm and egg counts were numerically higher in the day-old infected groups. Egg dose significantly influenced the prevalence of infection, worm establishment rate, worm egg production and mean worm count. The 300 and 900 egg doses resulted in significantly higher worm count and egg production than the 100 egg dose. A significant negative correlation was observed between egg dose and worm establishment rate indicating an inverse relationship. Immunosuppression with DEX, but not CY resulted in significantly higher mean worm burden than in control chickens with excreta egg counts also considerably higher in DEX treated birds. Our results suggest that trickle infection at day-old with infective doses of 300 eggs coupled with immunosuppression with DEX would provide the most efficient way to propagate A. galli worms in vivo, as using older birds or a higher egg dose did not provide any advantage.	0
35345851	Time-Course Transcriptional and Chromatin Accessibility Profiling Reveals Genes Associated With Asymmetrical Gonadal Development in Chicken Embryos.	In birds, male gonads form on both sides whereas most females develop asymmetric  gonads. Multiple early lines of evidence suggested that the right gonad fails to  develop into a functional ovary, mainly due to differential expression of PITX2 in the gonadal epithelium. Despite some advances in recent years, the molecular mechanisms underlying asymmetric gonadal development remain unclear. Here, using  bulk analysis of whole gonads, we established a relatively detailed profile of four representative stages of chicken gonadal development at the transcriptional  and chromatin levels. We revealed that many candidate genes were significantly enriched in morphogenesis, meiosis and subcellular structure formation, which may be responsible for asymmetric gonadal development. Further chromatin accessibility analysis suggested that the transcriptional activities of the candidate genes might be regulated by nearby open chromatin regions, which may act as transcription factor (TF) binding sites and potential cis-regulatory elements. We found that LHX9 was a promising TF that bound to the left-biased peaks of many cell cycle-related genes. In summary, this study provides distinctive insights into the potential molecular basis underlying the asymmetric development of chicken gonads.	0
34567487	Clinical Effect Analysis of Laparoscopic Surgery for Gastric Tumor under Data Mining.	This paper mainly analyzes the feasibility of laparoscopic local gastrectomy for  the treatment of benign gastric tumors, evaluating its curative effect, and the use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) such as Hedyotis diffusa, Radix Pseudostellariae, yi, Pinellia ternata, Ophiopogon japonicus, wood fragrance, Perilla, Scutellaria baicalensis, Yuzhu, hawthorn, Artemisia annua, chicken yellow film, nail, and turtle, and clinical symptoms of statistical analysis of data mining. A total of 86 patients with gastric benign tumor were selected as the research object and were divided into observation group and control group with 43 cases in each by the random number table method. The control group received radical gastrectomy for benign tumor under laparoscopy, while the observation group received local gastrectomy under laparoscopy. Perioperative indexes such as operative time, intraoperative blood loss, and length of hospital stay were recorded in the two groups. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the incidence of complications was compared. Based on the clinical analysis of the drug used, the results of association significance were selected, and the top ten results were selected in order of confidence and grouped according to clinical symptoms, respectively, as follows:  (1) abdominal distension: Hedyotis diffusa, Radix Pseudostellariae, Poria cocos,  Huckleberry, and Coix seed; (2) dry mouth: Poria cocos, Radix Radix Pseudostellariae, Coix seed, Pinellia tuber, and Radix Ophiopogonis. The results  showed that the minimum operation time in the observation group was 159.7 ± 13.07 min and the maximum was 172.57 ± 2.47 min, which was lower than that in the control group (the minimum was 172.46 ± 12.45 min and the maximum was 186.49 ± 24.32 min). The length of hospital stay (6.51 ± 1.29 days) was lower than that in the control group (7.56 ± 1.42 days) (P < 0.05). The CEA and CRP levels decreased significantly in both groups after treatment (P < 0.05). However, the observation group's CEA was (4.21 ± 1.05) mg/L and CRP was (8.46 ± 1.25) μg/L. In the control group, CEA was (4.18 ± 1.02) mg/L and CRP was  (8.39 ± 1.24) μg/L. There were no significant differences (P < 0.05). The incidence of complications in the observed group was 4.7% lower than 7.0% in the  control group (P < 0.05). Therefore, laparoscopic local gastric resection for benign gastric tumors can effectively reduce the incidence of CEA and CRP level and complications and improve the perioperative indicators, which is worth popularizing in clinical practice.	0
34774358	A novel DNA platform designed for vaccine use with high transgene expression and  immunogenicity.	The development of new, low-cost vaccines and effective gene therapies requires accurate delivery and high-level expression of candidate genes. We developed a plasmid vector, pIDV-II, that allows for both easy manipulation and high expression of exogenous genes in mammalian cells. This plasmid is based upon the  pVax1 plasmid and shares a common structure with typical mammalian transcription  units. It is composed of a chicken β-actin promoter (CAG), followed by an intron  and flanked by two restriction sites, and also includes a post-transcriptional regulatory element, followed by a transcriptional termination signal. While the modification of pVax1 elements either decreased eGFP expression levels or had no  effect at all, replacement of the promoter, the poly-A signal, deletion of the T7 and AmpR promoters, and inversion of the ORI-Neo/Kan cassette, significantly increased in vitro eGFP expression with the modified plasmid called pIDV-II. To further evaluate our vector, expression levels of three viral antigens were compared in cell lines transfected either with pVax1 or pCAGGS backbones as controls. Higher transgene expression was consistently observed with pIDV-II. The humoral and cellular responses generated in mice immunized with pIDV-II vs pVax1  expressing each viral antigen individually were superior by 2-fold or more as measured by ELISA and ELISPOT assays. Overall these results indicate that pIDV-II induces robust transgene expression, with concomitant improved cellular and humoral immune responses against the transgene of interest over pVax1. The new vector, pIDV-II, offers an additional alternative for DNA based vaccination and gene therapy for animal and human use.	0
35431079	Worm control practices on free-range egg farms in Australia and anthelmintic efficacy against nematodes in naturally infected layer chickens.	This study investigated worm control practices by free-range egg farmers and the  efficacy of the commercial anthelmintics levamisole (LEV), piperazine (PIP), flubendazole (FLBZ) and fenbendazole (FBZ) against gastrointestinal nematodes on  two free-range layer farms in Australia. An online survey comprising 36 questions was designed and implemented using SurveyMonkey. The survey contained questions about participant demographics, farm and flock characteristics, perceived intestinal worm importance, infection monitoring, deworming and other worm control practices. A link for the survey was emailed to free range egg producers  from their industry body in December 2019. The anthelmintic efficacy trial was conducted in a total of 229 layers naturally infected with Ascaridia galli, Hetarakis gallinarum, Capillaria spp. and/or tape worms. Chickens received a single oral dose of LEV (28 mg/kg), PIP (100 mg/kg), FBZ (10 mg/kg) or LEV-PIP co-administered at their full individual doses, and FLBZ (Flubenol®), 30 ppm or 60 ppm) in the feed over 7 days. Anthelmintic efficacies were estimated by both worm count reduction (WCR %) and excreta egg count reduction (EECR %) tests 10 days after start of treatment. The survey with a response rate of 16/203, revealed that worm infection was of moderate concern to the producers and the majority (68%) felt that the current anthelmintics work effectively. The level of understanding of worms, monitoring and control practices did not reveal any major deficiencies of concern. The most commonly used anthelmintic was LEV (73%) followed by PIP (45%). Based on a standard cut-off value (≥90%), LEV, LEV-PIP, and FBZ attained the desired efficacy but PIP exhibited reduced efficacy against  immature A. galli (61-85%), all stages of H. gallinarum (42-77%) and Capillaria spp. (25-44%). FLBZ was highly effective against all stages of roundworms and tapeworm infections. Even though there was some association between the efficacies estimated by WCR % and EECR % the latter was poorly associated in the  natural infection model and hence does not provide a reasonable alternative for assessing anthelmintic efficacy when immature stages of the lifecycle are included. These results show no evidence of loss of susceptibility to the tested  anthelmintics on these farms supporting the perception of producers that participated in the survey that current treatments work effectively. The reduced  efficacy of PIP against some species and immature stages is related to its spectrum of activity rather than providing evidence of emerging resistance.	0
34585985	Development of an Inactivated H7N9 Subtype Avian Influenza Serological DIVA Vaccine Using the Chimeric HA Epitope Approach.	H7N9 avian influenza virus (AIV) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen, and it is necessary to develop a differentiating infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) vaccine for the purpose of eradication. H7N9 subtype AIV hemagglutinin subunit 2  glycoprotein (HA2) peptide chips and antisera of different AIV subtypes were used to screen H7N9 AIV-specific epitopes. A selected specific epitope in the HA2 protein of H7N9 AIV strain A/Chicken/Huadong/JD/17 (JD/17) was replaced with an epitope from an H3N2 subtype AIV strain by reverse genetics. The protection and serological DIVA characteristics of the recombinant H7N9 AIV strain were evaluated. The results showed that a specific epitope on the HA2 protein of H7N9  AIV, named the H7-12 peptide, was successfully screened. The recombinant H7N9 AIV with a modified epitope in the HA2 protein was rescued and named A/Chicken/Huadong/JD-cHA/17 (JD-cHA/17). The HA titer of JD-cHA/17 was 10 log2, and the 50% egg infective dose (EID50) titer was 9.67 log10 EID50/ml. Inactivated JD-cHA/17 induced a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titer similar that  of the parent strain and provided 100% protection against high-pathogenicity or low-pathogenicity H7N9 AIV challenge. A peptide chip coated with H7-12 peptide was successfully applied to detect the seroconversion of chickens infected or vaccinated with JD/17, while there was no reactivity with antisera of chickens vaccinated with JD-cHA/17. Therefore, the marked vaccine candidate JD-cHA/17 can  be used as a DIVA vaccine against H7N9 avian influenza when combined with an H7-12 peptide chip, making it a useful tool for stamping out the H7N9 AIV. IMPORTANCE DIVA vaccine is a useful tool for eradicating avian influenza, especially for highly pathogenic avian influenza. Several different DIVA strategies have been proposed for avian influenza inactivated whole-virus vaccine, involving the neuraminidase (NA), nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), matrix  protein 2 ectodomain (M2e), or HA2 gene. However, virus reassortment, residual protein in a vaccine component, or reduced vaccine protection may limit the application of these DIVA strategies. Here, we constructed a novel chimeric H7N9  AIV, JD-cHA/17, that expressed the entire HA protein with substitution of an H3 AIV epitope in HA2. The chimeric H7N9 recombinant vaccine provides full clinical  protection against high-pathogenicity or low-pathogenicity H7N9 AIV challenge. Combined with a short-peptide-based microarray chip containing the H7N9 AIV epitope in HA2, our finding is expected to be useful as a marker vaccine designed for avian influenza.	0
35125917	Evaluation of Commercial 6-Phytases on Growth Performance, Bone Mineral Content,  and Feed Digestibility of Broiler Chicks.	We evaluated the effects of 6-phytases on the growth performance of broilers (UK  Chunky) under the recommended supplier-application dosage of each phytase. A nutritionally sufficient standard diet was administered as the base diets in the  positive control feed. The diet in the negative control feed was designed by reducing total phosphorous, non-phytate phosphorus, and calcium by 0.1% to evaluate the effect of the nutrient restriction on broilers. Four 6-phytases were added to negative control feeds at the level of the recommended dosage of each product to compare the effect of phytases on broiler technical performance, tibia ash, and feed digestibility. Nine hundred one-day-old broiler chicks (males and females) were distributed in a completely randomized design composed of six treatments and three replicates of 50 chicks each. Chicks were fed ad libitum for 49 days. Body weight gain and feed intake were recorded on days 21 and 49, tibia  ash was measured on day 21, and apparent ileal digestibility of dry matter, crude protein, and total phosphorus were analyzed on day 49. Birds reared with test feeds supplemented with phytase showed higher body weight gain and feed intake compared to those of the negative control birds. No significant differences in traits were observed among different phytase treatments. Similarly, the percentage of tibia ash increased when phytase was supplemented, resulting in higher bone levels compared to that of the positive control. The apparent ileal digestibility of crude protein and total phosphorus was enhanced by supplementing negative control diets with phytases.	0
34844112	Epididymal mRNA and miRNA transcriptome analyses reveal important genes and miRNAs related to sperm motility in roosters.	Sperm motility is a crucial trait in chicken production, and the epididymis is an essential organ in the reproductive system. Currently, the molecular mechanisms underlying sperm motility in the epididymis are unclear. In this study, 8 cDNA libraries and eight miRNA libraries were constructed from roosters (4 chickens per group) with diverse sperm motility. After a comparative analysis of epididymal transcriptomes, we detected 84 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the edgeR package. Integrated interpretation of DEGs indicated that MMP9, SLN, WT1, PLIN1, and LRRIQ1 are the most promising candidate genes affecting sperm motility in the epididymis of roosters. MiR-146a, mir-135b, and mir-205 could play important regulatory roles in sperm maturation, capacitation, and motility. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis of the mRNA and miRNAs transcriptomes in silico identified a promising gene-miRNA pair miR-135b-HPS5, which may be a vital regulator of sperm motility in the epididymis. Our findings  provide novel integrated information of miRNAs and genes that shed light on the regulatory mechanisms of fertility in roosters.	0
35095857	Differential Virus-Specific IFN-Gamma Producing T Cell Responses to Marek's Disease Virus in Chickens With B19 and B21 MHC Haplotypes.	Marek's disease virus (MDV), the etiologic agent for Marek's disease (MD), causes a deadly lymphoproliferative disease in chickens. Causes of the well-documented association between genetically defined lines of chicken and resistance to MD remain unknown. Here, the frequencies of IFN-gamma producing pp38 and MEQ-specific T cell responses were determined in line N (B21 haplotype; MD-resistant) and line P2a (B19 haplotype, MD-susceptible) chickens after infection with vaccine and/or virulent (RB1B) strains of MDV using both standard  ex vivo and cultured chIFN-gamma ELISPOT assays. Notably, MDV infection of naïve  and vaccinated MD-resistant chickens induced higher frequencies of IFN-gamma producing MDV-specific T cell responses using the cultured and ex vivo ELISPOT assay, respectively. Remarkably, vaccination did not induce or boost MEQ-specific effector T cells in the susceptible chickens, while it boosted both pp38-and MEQ-specific response in resistant line. Taken together, our results revealed that there is a direct association between the magnitude of T cell responses to pp38 and MEQ of MDV antigens and resistance to the disease.	0
35400313	Genome-wide association studies and haplotype sharing analysis targeting the growth traits in Yandang partridge chickens.	The body size of a chicken is an economically important trait as it directly influences the benefits of the poultry industry, but the relevant genetic mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we measured eight growth  traits for 94 Yandang partridge chickens, then undertook genome-wide association  studies (GWAS) for those traits in using a linear mixed model based on 10× whole  genomic sequencing data to better understand the knowledge of the genetic architecture of growth traits. Ninety-four individuals and 7647883 SNPs remained  after quality control and removal of the sex chromosomes, and these data were used to carry out a GWAS analysis. The result showed that only one significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) locates at 14852873 bp on SSC13 surpassed the genome-wide significance level for Keel length (KL). Through linkage disequilibrium analysis and haplotype sharing analysis, we identified one haplotype underlying the SSC13 significantly associated with KL, which could be selected as a potential candidate haplotype that is used in molecular breeding of Yandang partridge chicken. On the other hand, we have learned from a method called bootstrap testing to verify the reliability of GWAS with small experimental samples, which users can access at https://github.com/xuwenwu24/Bootstrap-test.	0
35189072	Identification of nucleotide polymorphisms in the key promoter region of chicken  annexins A2 gene associatied with egg laying traits.	Annexin A2 (ANXA2) is a member of the A subfamily of a multifunctional calcium dependent membrane phospholipid binding protein family. The mRNA expression of ANXA2 is consistent with ovary function and egg laying in chickens. In this study, six nucleotide polymorphisms in the key promoter region of chicken ANXA2 gene (-2861 bp to -1394 bp), i.e.,: g.-2337 indel (GT), g.-2255 C > T, g. -2248 A > G, g.-2188 A > G, g.-2169 G > A, g.-2160 A > C, were identified. Their  distributions in populations of Xinyang Brown, Recessive White Rock, Wenchang and Wenshang Barred chickens were analyzed. In the Recessive White Rock chicken population, CAA, CAG and TGG were three major haplotypes. Association analysis indicated that the individuals with diplotype TGG/TGG laid more eggs at 32 weeks, and the individual with diplotype CAG/TGG laid at the earlier age. Luciferase activity assay showed that mutation from C to T at -2255 increased trascriptional activity of chicken ANXA2, which is consistent with its effect on egg laying traits.	0
35432481	Transcriptome Analysis Reveals miR-302a-3p Affects Granulosa Cell Proliferation by Targeting DRD1 in Chickens.	Egg production is an important economic trait in laying chickens as higher yields bring higher profits. Small yellow follicle (SYFL) development is a key determinant of chicken reproductive performance; however, the majority of SYFLs are not selected during the process of chicken reproduction and thus, atresia occurs. Although there have been numerous omic studies focused on egg production, the molecular mechanisms involved are still not well-understood. In this study, we used high-throughput technology to analyze the differences between the SYFL mRNA transcriptomes of high- (H) and low-egg-yielding (L) Taihang layer hens, with the aim of identifying the potential candidate genes involved in controlling the rate of egg production. We constructed six cDNA libraries, three from H and three from L Taihang hens and then performed high-throughput sequencing. Comparison of the H and L groups showed 415 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In the high-yield group, 226 were upregulated and 189 were downregulated. Differentially enriched biological functions and processes were identified using  Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database analysis. Ten of the candidate DEGs we identified (DRD1, MC5R, PCK1, CTSA, TGFBR3, AGO4, SLIT2, RGS1, SCNN1B, and ZP3) have been identified in previous studies as being involved in the development of small yellow follicles. DRD1 was  significantly enriched in the gap junction pathway, which is an important pathway in chicken granulosa cells (GCs) to pass nutrition to an oocyte. Homology analysis showed that DRD1 was highly conserved in numerous species, indicating that it may be a productive target for improving egg production. Evidence from bioinformatics analysis revealed that gga-miR-302a-3p putatively targets the 3'UTR region of DRD1. We then identified the functions of gga-miR-302a-3p in follicular granulosa cell proliferation by targeting DRD1. RT-qPCR analysis showed that DRD1 and miR-302a-3p expression were inversely related in the SYLs of high and low egg-yielding chickens. Luciferase assays showed that miR-302a-3p targets the 3'UTR of DRD1, and overexpression of miR-302a-3p significantly inhibits the expression of DRD1 in chicken GCs (p < 0.01). Functional experiments revealed that by targeting DRD1, miR-302a-3p acts as an inhibitor of GC proliferation. Taken together, we concluded that miR-302a-3p affects chicken GC proliferation by targeting DRD1. Our data expanded the knowledge base of genes whose functions are important in egg production and the molecular mechanisms of high-yield egg production in chicken small yellow follicles.	0
34584942	Transcriptomic profile of leg muscle during early growth and development in Haiyang yellow chicken.	Skeletal muscle growth and development from embryo to adult consists of a series  of carefully regulated changes in gene expression. This study aimed to identify candidate genes involved in chicken growth and development and to investigate the potential regulatory mechanisms of early growth in Haiyang yellow chicken. RNA sequencing was used to compare the transcriptomes of chicken muscle tissues at four developmental stages. In total, 6150 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) ( | fold change |   ≥  2; false discovery rate (FDR)  ≤  0.05) were detected by pairwise comparison in female chickens. Functional analysis showed that the DEGs  were mainly involved in the processes of muscle growth and development and cell differentiation. Many of the DEGs, such as MSTN, MYOD1, MYF6, MYF5, and IGF1, were related to chicken growth and development. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that the DEGs were significantly enriched in four pathways related to growth and development: extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, tight junction, and insulin signalling pathways. A total of 42 DEGs assigned to these pathways are potential  candidate genes for inducing the differences in growth among the four development stages, such as MYH1A, EGF, MYLK2, MYLK4, and LAMB3. This study identified a range of genes and several pathways that may be involved in regulating early growth.	0
35316733	Endoplasmic reticulum stress is involved in small white follicular atresia in chicken ovaries.	During the hierarchical development of follicles in laying hens, a large number of small white follicles (SWFs) undergo atresia caused by apoptosis rather than growing into large white follicles (LWFs), which reduces the number of follicles  developing into hierarchical preovulatory follicles and results in declines in egg production. Therefore, figuring out factors responsible for SWFs atresia is necessary to improve egg production of laying hens. Endoplasmic reticulum stress  (ERS) is one of the possible causes of cell apoptosis. However, the association between SWFs atresia and ERS in hens is yet to be answered. In this study, cell proliferation and apoptosis, expression levels of proteins and genes related to ERS, and cell ultrastructure were compared to elucidate whether ERS occurred in atretic small white follicles (ASWFs). Subsequently, a tunicamycin-induced ERS model and a serum withdrawal-induced atresia model of SWFs in vitro were established to investigate whether ERS could lead to follicular atresia. The results showed that the cell apoptosis increased significantly while the cell proliferation decreased evidently in ASWFs compared with SWFs. Meanwhile, swollen and vacuolization deformation of ERs was observed in the GCs but not TCs of ASWFs. Results of experiments in vitro demonstrated that treatment with serum withdrawal or tunicamycin inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis in SWFs, and the adverse effects of tunicamycin on SWFs manifested a dose-dependent increase. In comparison with the controls, treatment with serum withdrawal or tunicamycin upregulated expression levels of proteins and genes in  ERS pathway. Moreover, the dose of 5 μg/mL tunicamycin seemed to be the optimal concentration for establishing the tunicamycin-induced ERS model. Meanwhile, the  results of cell ultrastructure observation showed that ERs in GCs of SWFs of serum withdrawal group and treatment with 5 μg/mL tunicamycin group became swollen, dilatation and vacuolization. In conclusion, the data of this study indicated that ERS is involved in SWF atresia in laying hens, and ERS in GCs might be more severe than that in TCs.	0
35168561	Genetic effect of an InDel in the promoter region of the NUDT15 and its effect on myoblast proliferation in chickens.	BACKGROUND: Molecular breeding accelerates the speed of animal breeding. Screening molecular markers that can affect economic traits through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can provide a theoretical basis for molecular breeding. At present, a large number of molecular markers have been screened in poultry research, but few reports on how molecular markers affect economic traits exist. It is particularly important to reveal the action mechanisms of molecular  markers, which can provide more accurate information for molecular breeding. RESULTS: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between two indels (NUDT15-indel-2777 and NUDT15-indel-1673) in the promoter region of NUDT15 and growth and carcass traits in chickens and to explore the regulatory mechanism of NUDT15. Significant differences were found in genotype and allele frequencies  among commercial broilers, commercial laying hens and dual-purpose chickens. The  results of association analyses showed that these two indel loci could significantly affect growth traits, such as body weight, and carcass traits. Tissue expression profiling at E12 showed that the expression of NUDT15 was significantly higher in skeletal muscle, and time-expression profiling of leg muscle showed that the expression of NUDT15 in myoblasts was significantly higher in the E10 and E12 proliferation stages than in other stages. Promoter activity analysis showed that pro-1673-I and pro-1673-D significantly inhibited promoter activity, and the promoter activity of pro-1673-D was significantly lower than that of pro-1673-I. In addition, when NUDT15 was overexpressed or underwent interference in chicken primary myoblasts (CPMs), NUDT15 could inhibit the proliferation of CPMs. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the studied indels in the promoter region of NUDT15 may regulate the proliferation of CPMs by affecting NUDT15 expression, ultimately affecting the growth and carcass traits of chickens. These indel polymorphisms may be used together as molecular markers for improving economic traits in chickens.	0
34625122	Perturbations of the ileal mycobiota by necrotic enteritis in broiler chickens.	BACKGROUND: Intestinal microbiota is critical for maintaining animal health and homeostasis. However, involvement of the fungal community, also known as the mycobiota, in animal health and disease is poorly understood. This study was aimed to examine the association between the intestinal mycobiota and the severity of necrotic enteritis (NE), an economically significant poultry disease. METHODS: A total of 90 day-of-hatch Cobb broilers were infected with Eimeria maxima on d 10, followed by an oral challenge with C. perfringens on d 14 to induce NE, while another 10 broilers were served as mock-infected controls. On d  17, the lesions in the jejunum were scored, and the ileal digesta were subjected  to DNA isolation and real-time PCR quantification of total bacterial and fungi populations. Internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) amplicon sequencing was also performed to profile the ileal mycobiota composition. Changes in the ileal mycobiota in response to NE were investigated. Spearman correlation analysis was  further conducted to identify the correlations between relative abundances of individual ileal fungi and the severity of NE. RESULTS: While the total bacterial population in the ileum was increased by 2- to 3-fold in NE chickens, the total fungal population was progressively declined in  more exacerbated NE, with the most severely infected chickens showing a nearly 50-fold reduction relative to mock-infected controls. Richness of the ileal mycobiota also tended to reduce in chickens with NE (P = 0.06). Compositionally,  among 30 most abundant fungal amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), 11 were diminished and 7 were enriched (P < 0.05), while 12 remained largely unchanged in NE-afflicted chickens (P > 0.05). Multiple Wallemia and Aspergillus species were  markedly diminished in NE (P < 0.05) and also showed a significant negative correlation with NE severity (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Dysbiosis of the ileal mycobiota is induced evidently by NE and the  extent of the dysbiosis is positively correlated with disease severity. These findings suggest a possible role of the intestinal mycobiota in NE pathogenesis and highlight the mycobiota as a new potential target for NE mitigation in poultry.	0
34628592	Neuro-Behavioral Dynamic Prediction of Interpersonal Cooperation and Aggression.	How to quickly predict an individual's behavioral choices is an important issue in the field of human behavior research. Using noninvasive electroencephalography, we aimed to identify neural markers in the prior outcome-evaluation stage and the current option-assessment stage of the chicken game that predict an individual's behavioral choices in the subsequent decision-output stage. Hierarchical linear modeling-based brain-behavior association analyses revealed that midfrontal theta oscillation in the prior outcome-evaluation stage positively predicted subsequent aggressive choices; also, beta oscillation in the current option-assessment stage positively predicted subsequent cooperative choices. These findings provide electrophysiological evidence for the three-stage theory of decision-making and strengthen the feasibility of predicting an individual's behavioral choices using neural oscillations.	0
35037399	Homologous PB1 gene promotes the replication efficiency of avian influenza H7N4 candidate vaccine virus.	BACKGROUND: The first and only case of human infection with the avian influenza A (H7N4) virus in China emerged in 2018. The H7N4 virus was distinct from previous  H7N9 viruses and raised public concerns. Therefore, developing a suitable H7N4 candidate vaccine virus (CVV) remains crucial for potential pandemic preparedness. METHODS: We constructed a reassortant virus with a (6 + 2) genome composition, then introduced the polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1) from a wild-type virus to develop a (5 + 3) reassortant virus through reverse genetics. We performed whole-genome sequencing to confirm the genome stability, assessed the growth ability in MDCK cells, and analyzed virus antigenicity using hemagglutination inhibition assays. Subsequently, the effect of homologous PB1 on polymerase activity, viral protein yield, and pathogenicity was assessed. RESULTS: The (5 + 3) virus harbouring the homologous PB1 gene exhibited significantly improved growth characteristics, higher viral protein yield, and polymerase activity than the (6 + 2) virus. After successive passage in embryonated eggs, glutamic acid (E) substituted glycine(G) at position 218 (H3 numbering) in the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of both (5 + 3) and (6 + 2) viruses. The substitution improved the growth of the (6 + 2) virus but exhibited no significant effect or alteration on the antigenicity of the (5 + 3) virus. Moreover, the (5 + 3) virus exhibited low pathogenicity in chickens and ferrets. CONCLUSION: Homologous PB1 of the H7N4 virus improves the growth ability while sustaining low pathogenicity. Collectively, the gene composition of the (5 + 3) reassortant virus is a suitable H7N4 CVV for potential pandemic preparedness.	0
35327110	Morphological Characteristics and Transcriptome Landscapes of Chicken Follicles during Selective Development.	Ovarian follicle selection largely depends on the transition of granulosa cells from an undifferentiated to a fully differentiated state, which is accompanied by morphological and functional changes in follicles. The processes and transcriptional regulation of follicles during follicle selection are unclear; we thus used follicles from the prehierarchal to the hierarchal stage to investigate histology, reproductive endocrinology, and transcription. The morphology of follicles changed markedly during follicle selection. The numbers of large white, small yellow, and large yellow follicles (LWF, SYF, and LYF, respectively) were 11.83 ± 2.79, 6.83 ± 2.23, and 1.00, respectively, per ovary. LYF showed thicker  granulosa cell layers than those of other prehierarchal follicles. Progesterone concentrations were significantly higher in LYF than that in LWF and SYF. In total, 16,823 genes were positively expressed in LWF, SYF, and LYF. Among follicle types, 1290 differentially expressed genes were enriched regarding cell  differentiation, blood vessel morphogenesis, and response to steroid hormones. Candidate genes associated with follicle selection participated in the Wnt signaling pathway, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and the TGF-β signaling pathway. We produced insights into crucial morphological characteristics of transcriptional regulation in follicle development. Our results provide an important basis for revealing the mechanism of follicle selection and potential impact on the poultry industry.	0
34778408	Post-angiography Retention of the Contrast Agent in the Left Atrial Appendage Is  Associated With Risk of Cardioembolic Stroke in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation: A Retrospective Study.	Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents an important risk factor for cardioembolic stroke, and most atrial thrombi originate from the left atrial appendage (LAA). Although the CHA2DS2-VASc score is widely used to estimate the risk of cardioembolic stroke in AF patients, yet greatly affected by many factors. This study was undertaken to determine the association between contrast  agent retention in LAA after LAA angiography and risks of cardioembolic stroke in patients with AF. Methods: This is a retrospective study. The demographic and clinical data of AF patients undergone left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) with or without catheter radiofrequency ablation were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were classified into either stroke or non-stroke group by the history with cardioembolic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Results: Sixty-two consecutive patients undergone LAAO were finally included, in whom 31 AF patients had a history of cardioembolic stroke or TIA (one TIA), and significantly higher CHA2DS2-VASc score (4.2 ± 1.4 vs. 3.3 ± 1.3; P = 0.006) as well as incidence of contrast agent retention in LAA (n = 20 vs. n = 7; P = 0.001) compared to the patients in non-stroke group. In addition, the relative proportion of distinctive morphological types of LAA was significantly different  between groups (P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores (OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0-3.0, P = 0.046) and LAA contrast agent retention (OR = 5.1, 95% CI: 1.1-23.9, P = 0.002) were associated  with increased risks of cardioembolic stroke. The patients with Windsock type LAA (OR = 7.8, 95% CI: 1.1-57.2, P = 0.044) and Cauliflower LAA (OR = 20.2, 95% CI: 3.2-125.5, P = 0.001) were more prone to cardioembolic stroke compared to those with Chicken Wing type LAA. Conclusion: Left atrial appendage contrast agent retention after LAA angiography is associated with the risks of cardioembolic stroke in patients with AF, and cardioembolic stroke is more seen in AF patients  with Windsock or Cauliflower type LAA.	0
34867850	Improving Chicken Responses to Glycoconjugate Vaccination Against Campylobacter jejuni.	Campylobacter jejuni is a common cause of diarrheal disease worldwide. Human infection typically occurs through the ingestion of contaminated poultry products. We previously demonstrated that an attenuated Escherichia coli live vaccine strain expressing the C. jejuni N-glycan on its surface reduced the Campylobacter load in more than 50% of vaccinated leghorn and broiler birds to undetectable levels (responder birds), whereas the remainder of the animals was still colonized (non-responders). To understand the underlying mechanism, we conducted three vaccination and challenge studies using 135 broiler birds and found a similar responder/non-responder effect. Subsequent genome-wide association studies (GWAS), analyses of bird sex and levels of vaccine-induced IgY responses did not correlate with the responder versus non-responder phenotype. In contrast, antibodies isolated from responder birds displayed a higher Campylobacter-opsonophagocytic activity when compared to antisera from non-responder birds. No differences in the N-glycome of the sera could be detected, although minor changes in IgY glycosylation warrant further investigation. As reported before, the composition of the microbiota, particularly levels of OTU classified as Clostridium spp., Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae are associated with the response. Transplantation of the cecal microbiota of responder birds into new birds in combination with vaccination resulted in further increases in vaccine-induced antigen-specific IgY responses when compared to birds that did not receive microbiota transplants. Our work suggests that the IgY effector function and microbiota contribute to the efficacy of the E. coli live vaccine, information that could form the basis for the development of improved vaccines targeted at the elimination of C. jejuni from poultry.	0
34936960	Effects of incubator oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations on hatchability of  fertile eggs, some blood parameters, and histopathological changes of broilers with different parental stock ages in high altitude.	The effects of incubator carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2) concentrations with parental stock age (PSA) on embryonic deaths (ED), hatchability of fertile eggs (HFE), some blood parameters, and the tissue development of broilers were investigated. Four consecutive repetitions following the similar materials and methods were carried. From 3 different aged ROSS 308 broiler parental flocks 7,680 hatching eggs were obtained and classified as young (Y; 29 wk), middle (M;  37 wk) and old (O; 55 wk) as regards PSA, and randomly distributed. Four different incubator ventilation programs (IVP) as control (C; 0.67% CO2 and 20.33% O2), high CO2 (HC; 1.57% CO2 and 20.26% O2), high O2 (HO; 0.50% CO2 and 21.16% O2), and high CO2 + O2 (HCO; 1.17% CO2 21.03% O2) were applied with oxygen concentrator, and ED and HFE were investigated. Lung and heart tissues, hemoglobin value, packed cell volume, and red blood cell count, triiodothyronine, thyroxine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) values of the chicks were analyzed. It was found that IVP affected ED and HFE. Higher rate of early ED (EED) was obtained from the HC than HCO, and higher middle+late stage+pipped but unhatched  ED (MLPED) with a lower rate of HFE was observed in the C group than HO and HCO (P < 0.05). Association was found between PSA and IVP (P < 0.05), being more evident in EED for young PSA, in MLPED with HFE for Y and O PSA. From hematological values, no statistical difference in RBC, PCV, and Hb values were found among the treatment groups, ACTH concentration known as a response to stress was found to be higher than C in all groups, triiodothyronine concentration was higher in the HO group than C. In the histopathological examination, used IVPs were found to have negative effects on the lung and heart  such as vacuolization, hemorrhage in all PSA groups except for C. Conclusively, PSA and IVP affected some hatching, blood and tissue development parameters of the broiler chicks.	0
34997179	Chicken blastoderms and primordial germ cells possess a higher expression of DNA  repair genes and lower expression of apoptosis genes to preserve their genome stability.	DNA is susceptible to damage by various sources. When the DNA is damaged, the cell repairs the damage through an appropriate DNA repair pathway. When the cell  fails to repair DNA damage, apoptosis is initiated. Although several genes are involved in five major DNA repair pathways and two major apoptosis pathways, a comprehensive understanding of those gene expression is not well-understood in chicken tissues. We performed whole-transcriptome sequencing (WTS) analysis in the chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEFs), stage X blastoderms, and primordial germ cells (PGCs) to uncover this deficiency. Stage X blastoderms mostly consist  of undifferentiated progenitor (pluripotent) cells that have the potency to differentiate into all cell types. PGCs are also undifferentiated progenitor cells that later differentiate into male and female germ cells. CEFs are differentiated and abundant somatic cells. Through WTS analysis, we identified that the DNA repair pathway genes were expressed more highly in blastoderms and high in PGCs than CEFs. Besides, the apoptosis pathway genes were expressed low in blastoderms and PGCs than CEFs. We have also examined the WTS-based expression profiling of candidate pluripotency regulating genes due to the conserved properties of blastoderms and PGCs. In the results, a limited number of pluripotency genes, especially the core transcriptional network, were detected higher in both blastoderms and PGCs than CEFs. Next, we treated the CEFs, blastoderm cells, and PGCs with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 1 h to induce DNA damage. Then, the H2O2 treated cells were incubated in fresh media for 3-12 h to  observe DNA repair. Subsequent analyses in treated cells found that blastoderm cells and PGCs were more likely to undergo apoptosis along with the loss of pluripotency and less likely to undergo DNA repair, contrasting with CEFs. These  properties of blastoderms and PGCs should be necessary to preserve genome stability during the development of early embryos and germ cells, respectively.	0
34555848	Association of female reproductive tract microbiota with egg production in layer  chickens.	BACKGROUND: The microbiota of the female reproductive tract is increasingly recognized as playing fundamental roles in animal reproduction. To explore the relative contribution of reproductive tract microbiomes to egg production in chickens, we investigated the microbiota in multiple reproductive and digestive tract sites from 128 female layer (egg-producing) chickens in comparable environments. RESULTS: We identified substantial differences between the diversity, composition, and predicted function of site-associated microbiota. Differences in reproductive tract microbiota were more strongly associated with egg production than those in the digestive tract. We identified 4 reproductive tract microbial species, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides salanitronis, Bacteroides barnesiae, and Clostridium leptum, that were related to immune function and potentially contribute to enhanced egg production. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide insights into the diverse microbiota characteristics of reproductive and digestive tracts and may help in designing strategies for controlling and manipulating chicken reproductive tract microbiota to improve egg production.	0
34583293	Association between farm biosecurity practices and antimicrobial usage on commercial chicken farms in Chattogram, Bangladesh.	Commercial broiler and layer farming represents an important livestock industry in Bangladesh. Adequate biosecurity practices are considered to be an effective method to prevent infectious disease occurrence on commercial poultry farms, but  antimicrobials are also frequently administered to reduce disease risk. We conducted a cross-sectional study on 57 commercial layer and 83 broiler farms in  eight subdistricts of the Chattogram district in Bangladesh to investigate the relationship between implemented biosecurity practices and the use of antimicrobials on these farms. We used a causal diagram framework to inform multi-level mixed effects logistic regression models to explore the total and direct effects of biosecurity practices implemented on commercial farms on prophylactic versus therapeutic antimicrobial usage on these farms. Overall, inadequate biosecurity was more common on broiler compared to layer farms and on  farms rearing smaller flock sizes. For example, separation of sick from healthy birds was more common on layer farms (85.2 %, 46/54) compared to broiler farms (38.6 %, 32/83) (p = 0.001). Prophylactic administration (compared to therapeutic use) of antimicrobials was less common on farms that were separating sick birds from the healthy birds (total and direct effect OR = 0.1, 95 % CI: 0.1-0.6, p = 0.006) and less common on farms that used a poorer quality source of water for drinking, cooling, cleaning, and washing (total and direct effect OR = 0.3, 95 %  CI: 0.1-0.9, p = 0.036). In contrast, farmers that used washing facilities (versus non-usage of washing facilities) were more likely to administer antimicrobials prophylactically (total and direct effect OR = 3.9, 95 % CI: 1.3-11.3, p = 0.012). The null model ICC indicated significant clustering at the  subdistrict level (ICC = 0.20, 95 % CI: 0.04-0.60, p = 0.013), but the ICC was reduced after including flock size and farm type, and the biosecurity practices as fixed effects (ICC = 0.14, 95 % CI: 0.02-0.59, p = 0.0661). Overall, our study highlighted that a large proportion of commercial chicken farmers mediated poor biosecurity practices by prophylactic application of antimicrobials. The results  of our research can be used to inform awareness programs for commercial poultry farmers emphasizing the importance of improving biosecurity rather than using antimicrobials to reduce the risk of poultry disease occurrence.	0
35208655	Distribution of Salmonella spp. Serotypes Isolated from Poultry in Abruzzo and Molise Regions (Italy) during a 6-Year Period.	Human salmonellosis incidence is increasing in the European Union (EU). Salmonellaenterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteriditis, Salmonellaenterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (including its monophasic variant) and Salmonellaenterica subsp. enterica serovar Infantis represent targets in control  programs due to their frequent association with human cases. This study aimed to  detect the most prevalent serotypes circulating in Abruzzo and Molise Regions between 2015 and 2020 in the framework of the Italian National Control Program for Salmonellosis in Poultry (PNCS)]. A total of 332 flocks of Abruzzo and Molise Regions were sampled by veterinary services in the period considered, and 2791 samples were taken. Samples were represented by faeces and dust from different categories of poultry flocks: laying hens (n = 284), broilers (n = 998), breeding chickens (n = 1353) and breeding or fattening turkeys (n = 156). Breeding and fattening turkeys had the highest rate of samples positive for Salmonella spp. (52.6%; C.I. 44.8%-60.3%). Faeces recovered through boot socks represented the greatest number of positive samples (18.2%). Salmonellaenterica subsp. enterica serovar Infantis was the prevalent serotype in breeding and fattening turkeys (32.7%; C.I. 25.8%-40.4%) and in broiler flocks (16.5%; C.I. 14.4%-19.0%). Salmonellaenterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium was detected at low levels in laying hens (0.7%; C.I. 0.2%-2.5%) followed by breeding and fattening turkeys  (0.6%; C.I. 0.2%-2.5%). Salmonellaenterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteriditis was also detected at low levels in laying hens (2.5%; C.I. 1.2%-5.0%). These findings highlight the role of broilers and breeding/fattening turkeys as reservoirs of Salmonella spp. and, as a consequence, in the diffusion of dangerous serotypes as Salmonellaenterica subsp. enterica serovar Infantis. This  information could help veterinary services to analyze local trends and to take decisions not only based on indications from national control programs, but also  based on real situations at farms in their own competence areas.	0
34834960	Immunogenicity of Novel Live Vaccine Based on an Artificial rHN20 Strain against  Emerging Fowl Adenovirus 4.	In recent years, hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome (HHS), caused by novel fowl  adenovirus 4 (FAdV-4), has caused serious economic losses to the poultry industry. Vaccines are important for preventing and controlling HHS. Current FAdV-4 vaccine research and development are mainly focuses on inactivated vaccines and relatively fewer live vaccines. We previously demonstrated that the  hexon gene is the key gene responsible for the high pathogenicity of FAdV-4 and constructed a non-pathogenic chimeric virus rHN20 strain based on the emerging FAdV-4. In this study, the immunogenicity of artificially rescued rHN20 was evaluated in chickens using different routes and doses as a live vaccine. The live rHN20 vaccine induced high titers of neutralizing antibodies against FAdV-4  and fully protected the immunized chickens against a lethal dose of FAdV-4. Furthermore, immunized chickens showed no clinical symptoms or histopathological  changes in the FAdV-4-targeted liver, and the viral load in the tissues of immunized chickens was significantly lower than that of chickens in the challenge control group. Collectively, the live rHN20 vaccine effectively protected our sample against FAdV-4 infection and can be considered a live vaccine candidate for preventing HHS in the poultry industry.	0
34571798	MIDESP: Mutual Information-Based Detection of Epistatic SNP Pairs for Qualitative and Quantitative Phenotypes.	The interactions between SNPs result in a complex interplay with the phenotype, known as epistasis. The knowledge of epistasis is a crucial part of understanding genetic causes of complex traits. However, due to the enormous number of SNP pairs and their complex relationship to the phenotype, identification still remains a challenging problem. Many approaches for the detection of epistasis have been developed using mutual information (MI) as an association measure. However, these methods have mainly been restricted to case-control phenotypes and are therefore of limited applicability for quantitative traits. To overcome this  limitation of MI-based methods, here, we present an MI-based novel algorithm, MIDESP, to detect epistasis between SNPs for qualitative as well as quantitative  phenotypes. Moreover, by incorporating a dataset-dependent correction technique,  we deal with the effect of background associations in a genotypic dataset to separate correct epistatic interaction signals from those of false positive interactions resulting from the effect of single SNP×phenotype associations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MIDESP, we apply it on two real datasets with qualitative and quantitative phenotypes, respectively. Our results suggest that by eliminating the background associations, MIDESP can identify important genes,  which play essential roles for bovine tuberculosis or the egg weight of chickens.	0
35405904	G0S2 Gene Polymorphism and Its Relationship with Carcass Traits in Chicken.	Gene single nucleotide polymorphisms can be used as auxiliary markers in molecular breeding and are an effective method to improve production performance. G0S2 is a key gene involved in regulating fat metabolism, but little research has been conducted on this gene regarding its role in poultry. In this study, the specialized commercial partridge chicken strain G0S2 gene was cloned and sequenced, and the relationship between the SNP sites on G0S2 and the carcass traits of chickens was investigated. The results showed that a total of seven SNPs were detected on G0S2 (g.102G &gt; A, g.255G &gt; A, g.349C &gt; T, g.384A &gt; G, g.386G &gt; A, g.444G &gt; A, g.556G &gt; A). Two sites are located in the coding region and five sites are located in the 3'-UTR. SNPs located in the coding region are synonymous mutations. g.444G &gt; A has a significant correlation with abdominal fat weight. The chickens with AG and GG genotypes have the highest abdominal fat weight, while the AA genotype is lower. The g.102G &gt; A genotype has a significant correlation with live and abdominal fat weight. The  live weight and abdominal fat weight of the chickens with AA and AG genotypes are at a higher level and have a larger gap than the GG genotype. Chickens with the AA genotype in g.556G &gt; A had the lowest fat weight. The results of present study can provide practical information for molecular marker-assisted breeding of chicken carcass traits.	0
34773482	LncRNAs in domesticated animals: from dog to livestock species.	Animal genomes are pervasively transcribed into multiple RNA molecules, of which  many will not be translated into proteins. One major component of this transcribed non-coding genome is the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are defined as transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides with low coding-potential capabilities. Domestic animals constitute a unique resource for studying the genetic and epigenetic basis of phenotypic variations involving protein-coding and non-coding RNAs, such as lncRNAs. This review presents the current knowledge  regarding transcriptome-based catalogues of lncRNAs in major domesticated animals (pets and livestock species), covering a broad phylogenetic scale (from dogs to chicken), and in comparison with human and mouse lncRNA catalogues. Furthermore,  we describe different methods to extract known or discover novel lncRNAs and explore comparative genomics approaches to strengthen the annotation of lncRNAs.  We then detail different strategies contributing to a better understanding of lncRNA functions, from genetic studies such as GWAS to molecular biology experiments and give some case examples in domestic animals. Finally, we discuss  the limitations of current lncRNA annotations and suggest research directions to  improve them and their functional characterisation.	0
35066209	Multifaceted roles of the egg perivitelline layer in avian reproduction: Functional insights from the proteomes of chicken egg inner and outer sublayers.	The avian egg perivitelline layer (PL) is a proteinaceous structure that encloses the egg yolk. It consists of the inner and the outer perivitelline layers (IPL and OPL, respectively) that are assumed to play distinct roles in bird reproduction. To gain insight into their respective function, we analyzed the proteome of IPL and OPL in chicken unfertilized eggs after mechanical separation, using a GeLC-MS/MS strategy. Of the 412 proteins identified, 173 proteins were uniquely recovered in IPL and 98 proteins in OPL, while 141 proteins were identified in both sublayers. Genes coding the most abundant proteins were shown  to be expressed either in the liver/ovary (IPL formation) or in the oviduct (OPL  formation), but rarely in both. The presence of oviduct-specific proteins (including LYZ, VMO1, AvBD11, PTN, OVAL and LOC10175704) in IPL strongly suggests that they participate in the physical association of IPL to OPL, whose tight attachment was further evidenced by analyses of IPL/OPL interfaces (by scanning electron microscopy). Functional annotation of identified proteins revealed functions associated with fertilization and early development for IPL, while OPL  would rather participate in egg defense and embryogenesis. Collectively, our data highlight the complementary functions of IPL and OPL that are major determinants  of bird reproductive success. SIGNIFICANCE: The present study unveils for the first time the individual proteomes of the two sublayers composing the chicken egg perivitelline layer (PL), which allowed to assign their respective putative biological roles in avian reproduction. The combination of proteomics with gene expression and ultrastructural analyses provides insightful data on the structure and biochemistry of the avian PL. The functional annotation of PL proteins highlights the multifaceted biological functions of this structure in reproduction including fertilization, embryonic development, and antimicrobial protection. This work will stimulate further research to validate predicted functions and to compare the physiology and the functional specificities of PL in egg-laying species.	0
35391799	Population Genomic Sequencing Delineates Global Landscape of Copy Number Variations that Drive Domestication and Breed Formation of in Chicken.	Copy number variation (CNV) is an important genetic mechanism that drives evolution and generates new phenotypic variations. To explore the impact of CNV on chicken domestication and breed shaping, the whole-genome CNVs were detected via multiple methods. Using the whole-genome sequencing data from 51 individuals, corresponding to six domestic breeds and wild red jungle fowl (RJF), we determined 19,329 duplications and 98,736 deletions, which covered 11,123 copy number variation regions (CNVRs) and 2,636 protein-coding genes. The principal component analysis (PCA) showed that these individuals could be divided into four populations according to their domestication and selection purpose. Seventy-two highly duplicated CNVRs were detected across all individuals, revealing pivotal roles of nervous system (NRG3, NCAM2), sensory (OR), and follicle development (VTG2) in chicken genome. When contrasting the CNVs of domestic breeds to those of RJFs, 235 CNVRs harboring 255 protein-coding genes, which were predominantly involved in pathways of nervous, immunity, and reproductive system development, were discovered. In breed-specific CNVRs, some valuable genes were identified, including HOXB7 for beard trait in Beijing You chicken; EDN3, SLMO2, TUBB1, and GFPT1 for melanin deposition in Silkie chicken; and SORCS2 for aggressiveness in  Luxi Game fowl. Moreover, CSMD1 and NTRK3 with high duplications found exclusively in White Leghorn chicken, and POLR3H, MCM9, DOCK3, and AKR1B1L found  in Recessive White Rock chicken may contribute to high egg production and fast-growing traits, respectively. The candidate genes of breed characteristics are valuable resources for further studies on phenotypic variation and the artificial breeding of chickens.	0
35145500	RW-BP100-4D, a Promising Antimicrobial Candidate With Broad-Spectrum Bactericidal Activity.	With the rapid emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in bacteria from animal, animal-derived food and human clinic, it is of great significance to develop new approaches to combat the multidrug-resistant bacteria. This study presented a short linear antimicrobial peptide RW-BP100-4D,  which was derived from RW-BP100 (RRLFRRILRWL-NH2) by transforming the N-terminal  4th amino acid from L- to D-enantiomer. This modification remarkably reduced the  peptide cytotoxicity to mammalian cells, as indicated by hemolytic and cytotoxicity assays. Meanwhile, the antimicrobial activity of RW-BP100-4D was improved against a more variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (sensitive and resistant) as well as fungi. Also, RW-BP100-4D showed strong in vitro anti-biofilm activity in a concentration-dependent manner, including inhibition of the biofilm-formation and dispersion of the mature biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus. RW-BP100-4D could be efficiently uptaken by bovine mammary epithelial cells (MAC-T) cells to eliminate the intracellular S. aureus ATCC29213 and Salmonella enterica ATCC13076. Moreover, RW-BP100-4D was highly effective in  food disinfection of multiple bacterial contamination (including S. aureus, Listeria monocytogenesis, Escherichia coli O157: H7, Campylobacter jejuni, S. enterica, and Shewanella putrefaction, 3.61 ± 0.063 log reduction) on chicken meat, and could kill 99.99% of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strain in the mouse skin infection model. In summary, RW-BP100-4D is a promising antimicrobial candidate for application on food disinfection and local  infection treatment. However, the protease-sensitivity of RW-BP100-4D and toxic effect at higher doses reduced the therapeutic effect of the candidate peptide in vivo and should be improved in the future studies.	0
34567076	Time Course Transcriptomic Study Reveals the Gene Regulation During Liver Development and the Correlation With Abdominal Fat Weight in Chicken.	Background: The liver is the central metabolic organ of animals. In chicken, knowledge on the relationship between gene expression in the liver and fat deposition during development is still limited. A time-course transcriptomic study from the embryonic (day 12) to the egg-producing period (day 180 after hatch) was performed to profile slow-growing meat type chicken liver gene expression and to investigate its correlation with abdominal fat deposition. Results: The transcriptome profiles showed a separation of the different developmental stages. In total, 13,096 genes were ubiquitously expressed at all the tested developmental stages. The analysis of differentially expressed genes between adjacent developmental stages showed that biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids pathway was enriched from day 21 to day 140 after hatch. The correlation between liver gene expression and the trait abdominal fat weight (AFW) was analyzed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis. The genes MFGE8, HHLA1, CKAP2, and ACSBG2 were identified as hub genes in AFW positively correlated modules, which suggested important roles of these genes in the lipid metabolism in chicken liver. Conclusion: Our results provided a resource of developmental transcriptome profiles in chicken liver and suggested that the gene ACSBG2 among other detected genes can be used as a candidate gene for selecting low AFW chickens.	0
35453750	Clostridium perfringens Associated with Foodborne Infections of Animal Origins: Insights into Prevalence, Antimicrobial Resistance, Toxin Genes Profiles, and Toxinotypes.	Several food-poisoning outbreaks have been attributed to Clostridium perfringens  (C. perfringens) worldwide. Despite that, this crisis was discussed in a few studies, and additional studies are urgently needed in this field. Therefore, we  sought to highlight the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance, toxin profiles, and toxinotypes of C. perfringens isolates. In this study, 50 C. perfringens isolates obtained from 450 different animal origin samples (beef, chicken meat, and raw milk) were identified by phenotypic and genotypic methods. The antimicrobial susceptibility results were surprising, as most of the isolates (74%) showed multidrug-resistant (MDR) patterns. The phenotypic resistance to tetracycline, lincomycin, enrofloxacin, cefoxitin/ampicillin, and erythromycin was confirmed by the PCR detections of tet, lnu, qnr, bla, and erm(B) genes, respectively. In contrast to the toxinotypes C and E, toxinotype A prevailed (54%) among our isolates. Additionally, we found that the genes for C. perfringens enterotoxin (cpe) and C. perfringens beta2 toxin (cpb2) were distributed among the tested isolates with high prevalence rates (70 and 64%, respectively). Our findings confirmed that the C. perfringens foodborne crisis has been worsened by the evolution of MDR strains, which became the prominent phenotypes. Furthermore, we  were not able to obtain a fixed association between the toxinotypes and antimicrobial resistance patterns.	0
35205238	The SLC27A1 Gene and Its Enriched PPAR Pathway Are Involved in the Regulation of  Flavor Compound Hexanal Content in Chinese Native Chickens.	The role of hexanal in flavor as an indicator of the degree of oxidation of meat  products is undeniable. However, the genes and pathways of hexanal formation have not been characterized in detail. In this study, we performed differential gene expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on groups of Tiannong partridge chickens with different relative hexanal content in  order to find the genes involved in the formation of hexanal and the specific pathways of hexanal formation. Then we confirmed the relationship of these candidate genes with hexanal using Jingxing Yellow chicken and Wenchang chicken.  In this study, WGCNA revealed a module of co-expressed genes that were highly associated with the volatile organic compound hexanal. We also compared transcriptome gene expression data of samples from chicken groups with high and low relative contents of hexanal and identified a total of 651 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among them, 356 genes were up regulated, and 295 genes were downregulated. The different biological functions associated with the DEGs,  hub genes and hexanal were identified by functional analysis using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotations. Among all the hub genes in  the significant module identified by WGCNA, more were enriched in the PPAR signaling pathway, the proteasome pathway, etc. Additionally, we found that DEGs  and hub genes, including SLC27A1, ACOX3, NR4A1, VEGFA, JUN, EGR1, CACNB1, GADD45A and DUSP1, were co-enriched in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway, etc. Transcriptome results of the Jingxing Yellow chicken population showed that the SLC27A1 gene was significantly associated with hexanal and enriched in the PPAR pathway. Our study provides a comprehensive insight into the key genes related to hexanal content, and can be further explored by functional and molecular studies.	0
34696415	Newcastle Disease Virus Vectored Chicken Infectious Anaemia Vaccine Induces Robust Immune Response in Chickens.	Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strain R2B, with an altered fusion protein cleavage site, was used as a viral vector to deliver the immunogenic genes VP2 and VP1 of  chicken infectious anaemia virus (CIAV) to generate a bivalent vaccine candidate  against these diseases in chickens. The immunogenic genes of CIAV were expressed  as a single transcriptional unit from the NDV backbone and the two CIA viral proteins were obtained as separate entities using a self-cleaving foot-and-mouth  disease virus 2A protease sequence between them. The recombinant virus (rR2B-FPCS-CAV) had similar growth kinetics as that of the parent recombinant virus (rR2B-FPCS) in vitro with similar pathogenicity characteristics. The bivalent vaccine candidate when given in specific pathogen-free chickens as primary and booster doses was able to elicit robust humoral and cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses obtained in a vaccination study that was conducted over a  period of 15 weeks. In an NDV and CIAV ELISA trial, there was a significant difference in the titres of antibody between vaccinated and control groups which  showed slight reduction in antibody titre by 56 days of age. Hence, a second booster was administered and the antibody titres were maintained until 84 days of age. Similar trends were noticed in CMI response carried out by lymphocyte transformation test, CD4+ and CD8+ response by flow cytometry analysis and response of real time PCR analysis of cytokine genes. Birds were challenged with  virulent NDV and CIAV at 84 days and there was significant reduction in the NDV shed on the 2nd and 4th days post challenge in vaccinated birds as compared to unvaccinated controls. Haematological parameters comprising PCV, TLC, PLC and PHC were estimated in birds that were challenged with CIAV that indicated a significant reduction in the blood parameters of controls. Our findings support the development and assessment of a bivalent vaccine candidate against NDV and CIAV in chickens.	0
34869349	Dynamic Expression and Regulatory Network of Circular RNA for Abdominal Preadipocytes Differentiation in Chicken (Gallus gallus).	Circular RNA (circRNA), as a novel endogenous biomolecule, has been emergingly demonstrated to play crucial roles in mammalian lipid metabolism and obesity. However, little is known about their genome-wide identification, expression profile, and function in chicken adipogenesis. In present study, the adipogenic differentiation of chicken abdominal preadipocyte was successfully induced, and the regulatory functional circRNAs in chicken adipogenesis were identified from abdominal adipocytes at different differentiation stages using Ribo-Zero RNA-seq. A total of 1,068 circRNA candidates were identified and mostly derived from exons. Of these, 111 differentially expressed circRNAs (DE-circRNAs) were detected, characterized by stage-specific expression, and enriched in several lipid-related pathways, such as Hippo signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway.  Through weighted gene co-expression network analyses (WGCNA) and K-means clustering analyses, two DE-circRNAs, Z:35565770|35568133 and Z:54674624|54755962, were identified as candidate regulatory circRNAs in chicken  adipogenic differentiation. Z:35565770|35568133 might compete splicing with its parental gene, ABHD17B, owing to its strictly negative co-expression. We also constructed competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network based on DE-circRNA, DE-miRNA, DE-mRNAs, revealing that Z:54674624|54755962 might function as a ceRNA  to regulate chicken adipogenic differentiation through the gga-miR-1635-AHR2/IRF1/MGAT3/ABCA1/AADAC and/or the novel_miR_232-STAT5A axis. Translation activity analysis showed that Z:35565770|35568133 and Z:54674624|54755962 have no protein-coding potential. These findings provide valuable evidence for a better understanding of the specific functions and molecular mechanisms of circRNAs underlying avian adipogenesis.	0
34954461	Stress-induced immunosuppression increases levels of certain circulating miRNAs and affects the immune response to an infectious bursal disease virus vaccine in  chickens.	Stress-induced immunosuppression can affect the immune effect of vaccine. However, the mechanism of stress-induced immunosuppression affecting immune response to infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) vaccine in chicken is still unclear. In this study, thirteen IBDV related circulating miRNAs were selected to study their expressions, possible functions and mechanisms in dexamethasone (Dex)-induced immunosuppressed chicken vaccinated with IBDV attenuated vaccine. The experiment aimed to explore the relationship between the expressions of IBDV  related circulating miRNAs and stress-induced immunosuppression. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) results showed that Dex-induced immunosuppression could induce the differential expressions of the candidate serum circulating miRNAs, especially on the 2nd, 5th, 7th and 28th day after dexamethasone treatment. Dex-induced immunosuppression could affect the immune response to the IBDV vaccine, which was possibly achieved by partially regulating the differential expressions of the IBDV related circulating miRNAs. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the candidate miRNAs could regulate the immune function mainly through targeting genes (such as CREB1 and MAPK1) in TGF-β and MAPK signaling pathways. This study can provide a preliminary reference for further studying the function and mechanism of circulating miRNAs in immune regulation.	0
35173035	The Discovery of Chicken Foxp3 Demands Redefinition of Avian Regulatory T Cells.	Since the publication of the first chicken genome sequence, we have encountered genes playing key roles in mammalian immunology, but being seemingly absent in birds. One of those was, until recently, Foxp3, the master transcription factor of regulatory T cells in mammals. Therefore, avian regulatory T cell research is  still poorly standardized. In this study we identify a chicken ortholog of Foxp3  We prove sequence homology with known mammalian and sauropsid sequences, but also reveal differences in major domains. Expression profiling shows an association of Foxp3 and CD25 expression levels in CD4+CD25+ peripheral T cells and identifies a CD4-CD25+Foxp3high subset of thymic lymphocytes that likely represents yet undescribed avian regulatory T precursor cells. We conclude that Foxp3 is existent in chickens and that it shares certain functional characteristics with its mammalian ortholog. Nevertheless, pathways for regulatory T cell development  and Foxp3 function are likely to differ between mammals and birds. The identification and characterization of chicken Foxp3 will help to define avian regulatory T cells and to analyze their functional properties and thereby advance the field of avian immunology.	0
34591878	Approach direction and accuracy, but not response times, show spatial-numerical association in chicks.	Chicks trained to identify a target item in a sagittally-oriented series of identical items show a higher accuracy for the target on the left, rather than that on the right, at test when the series was rotated by 90°. Such bias seems to be due to a right hemispheric dominance in visuospatial tasks. Up to now, the bias was highlighted by looking at accuracy, the measure mostly used in non-human studies to detect spatial numerical association, SNA. In the present study, processing by each hemisphere was assessed by scoring three variables: accuracy,  response times and direction of approach. Domestic chicks were tested under monocular vision conditions, as in the avian brain input to each eye is mostly processed by the contralateral hemisphere. Four-day-old chicks learnt to peck at  the 4th element in a sagittal series of 10 identical elements. At test, when facing a series oriented fronto-parallel, birds confined their responses to the visible hemifield, with high accuracy for the 4th element. The first element in the series was also highly selected, suggesting an anchoring strategy to start the proto-counting at one end of the series. In the left monocular condition, chicks approached the series starting from the left, and in the right monocular condition, they started from the right. Both hemispheres appear to exploit the same strategy, scanning the series from the most lateral element in the clear hemifield. Remarkably, there was no effect in the response times: equal latency was scored for correct or incorrect and for left vs. right responses. Overall, these data indicate that the measures implying a direction of choice, accuracy and direction of approach, and not velocity, i.e., response times, can highlight  SNA in this paradigm. We discuss the relevance of the selected measures to unveil SNA.	0
34980121	Protective immunity induced by oral vaccination with a recombinant Lactococcus lactis vaccine against H5Nx in chickens.	BACKGROUND: The development of an influenza vaccine for poultry that provides broadly protective immunity against influenza H5Nx viruses is a challenging goal. RESULTS: Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis)/pNZ8149-HA1-M2 expressing hemagglutinin-1 (HA1) of A/chicken/Vietnam/NCVD-15A59/2015 (H5N6) and the conserved M2 gene of A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) was generated. L. lactis/pNZ8149-HA1-M2 could induce significant humoral, mucosal and cell-mediated immune responses, as well as neutralization antibodies. Importantly, L. lactis/pNZ8149-HA1-M2 could prevent disease symptoms without significant weight loss and confer protective immunity in a chicken model against lethal challenge with divergent influenza H5Nx viruses, including H5N6 and H5N1. CONCLUSIONS: L. lactis/pNZ8149-HA1-M2 can serve as a promising vaccine candidate  in poultry industry for providing protection against H5Nx virus infection in the  field application.	0
34809450	Why Did the Bee Eat the Chicken? Symbiont Gain, Loss, and Retention in the Vulture Bee Microbiome.	"Diet and gut microbiomes are intricately linked on both short and long timescales. Changes in diet can alter the microbiome, while microbes in turn allow hosts to access novel diets. Bees are wasps that switched to a vegetarian lifestyle, and the vast majority of bees feed on pollen and nectar. Some stingless bee species, however, also collect carrion, and a few have fully reverted to a necrophagous lifestyle, relying on carrion for protein and forgoing flower visitation altogether. These ""vulture"" bees belong to the corbiculate apid clade, which is known for its ancient association with a small group of core microbiome phylotypes. Here, we investigate the vulture bee microbiome, along with closely related facultatively necrophagous and obligately pollinivorous species, to understand how these diets interact with microbiome structure. Via deep sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and subsequent community analyses, we find that vulture bees have lost some core microbes, retained others, and entered into novel associations with acidophilic microbes found in the environment and on carrion. The abundance of acidophilic bacteria suggests that an acidic gut is important for vulture bee nutrition and health, as has been found in other carrion-feeding animals. Facultatively necrophagous bees have more variable microbiomes than strictly pollinivorous bees, suggesting that bee diet may interact with microbiomes on both short and long timescales. Further study of vulture bees promises to provide rich insights into the role of the microbiome in extreme diet switches. IMPORTANCE When asked where to find bees, people often picture fields of wildflowers. While true for almost all species, there is a group of specialized bees, also known as the vulture bees, that instead can be found slicing chunks of meat from carcasses in tropical rainforests. In this study, researchers compared the microbiomes of closely related bees that live in  the same region but vary in their dietary lifestyles: some exclusively consume pollen and nectar, others exclusively depend on carrion for their protein, and some consume all of the above. Researchers found that vulture bees lost some ancestral ""core"" microbes, retained others, and entered into novel associations with acidophilic microbes, which have similarly been found in other carrion-feeding animals such as vultures, these bees' namesake. This research expands our understanding of how diet interacts with microbiomes on both short and long timescales in one of the world's biodiversity hot spots."	0
35255339	Influence of laying hen-systems and ecologic variables on mites of medical and veterinary importance.	The search for improvements in the poultry production chain and for increased egg productivity have grown significantly. However, intensive production with or by using of confinement systems negatively affect the welfare of animals and is favoring the appearance of harmful ectoparasites in production. Due to differences in the existing management systems, (e.g. Californian and cage-free systems) and given the importance of the poultry industry in the international market, the aim of the present study was: (1) to compare mite community between SIG (Intensive system - cage: Californian) and SIF (Intensive system - free: cage free); (2) egg-laying systems to analyze how the abundances of the ectoparasites  Dermanyssus gallinae, Megninia ginlgymura, and Ornithonyssus sylviarum are affected by these egg-laying models; (3) to evaluate the association between the  functional diversity found in traps, organic matter, and feathers in both systems; and finally, (4) to analyze how abiotic factors (e.g. humidity, temperature at sampling) affect mite community composition inside each model. A total of 860,571 mites were sampled, belonging to 59 taxa from six functional groups. Mite composition in the SIF system was different from the SIG system, while their variations in dispersion homogeneity were quite similar to each other. Although taxonomic composition is different between them, they are quite similar when clustered according to functional diversity. The variables 'humidity' and 'temperature' were not determining factors for the appearance of species. The species that most contributed for distinguishing the models were: M. ginlgymura, Dermatophagoides farinae, D. gallinae, Tyrophagus putrescentiae, O. sylviarum, Blattisocius keegani, Glycyphagus sp., Acotyledon sp., and Cheyletus malaccensis, respectively. Dermanyssus gallinae was strongly associated with the  Californian model. Two taxa were highly correlated with cloaca, neck, dorsum, and inner wings; variations in relative air humidity also affected M. ginlgymura and  O. sylviarum populations. Organic matter had a high abundance of predatory mites  with potential for controlling mites of sanitary importance in the poultry chain.	0
34604602	Isolation, identification antimicrobial susceptibility and associated risk factors of Salmonella in semi-intensive poultry farms of Kafa zone, Southwest Ethiopia.	Salmonellosis is one of the major causes of poultry disease. The study aimed to isolate, identify, determine susceptibility and associated risk factors of salmonella specious in semi-intensive poultry farms of Kafa zone, southwest Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted on four purposively selected districts. Three farms were randomly selected per district and fecal samples were taken from a total of 302 chickens. Questionnaire was administered to farm owners and data was analyzed using STATA statistical software package. The overall prevalence of Salmonella enterica species in Kafa zone was 9.27% with Gimbo district 10.39%, Bita district 10.66%, Shishoende district 12% and Chena district 4%. Source of chickens, farm types and breed risk factors showed significant association (P < 0.05) with the disease prevalence. Having diarrhea and continuous farm systems significantly associated (P < 0.05). All isolates were 100% resistant to Oxtytetracycline and Ampicillin. Among 28 isolated Salmonella enterica species, 92.85% (n = 26) of them were showed multidrug resistance while  2 (7.14%) of them showed extensively drug resistance. Half of multidrug-resistant isolates were resistant to 5-6 antimicrobials, while 7.14% of isolates showed resistance to 7 antimicrobials. This study shows prevalence of Salmonella and its association with the breed, farm type, source of chicken and presence of diarrhea. A high antimicrobial resistance observed shows presence of concerns due to the emergence of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) in the poultry farms. Therefore, awareness should be created to the farmers on measures to avoid the risk factors of poultry disease and the occurrence of antimicrobials resistance in poultry farms.	0
34504189	Differentially expressed genes in the femur cartilage transcriptome clarify the understanding of femoral head separation in chickens.	Locomotor problems are among one of the main concerns in the current poultry industry, causing major economic losses and affecting animal welfare. The most common bone anomalies in the femur are dyschondroplasia, femoral head separation  (FHS), and bacterial chondronecrosis with osteomyelitis (BCO), also known as femoral head necrosis (FHN). The present study aimed to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes in the articular cartilage (AC) of normal and FHS-affected broilers by RNA-Seq analysis. In the transcriptome analysis, 12,169 genes were expressed in the femur AC. Of those, 107 genes were DE (FDR < 0.05) between normal and affected chickens, of which 9 were downregulated and 98 were upregulated in the affected broilers. In the gene-set enrichment analysis using the DE genes, 79 biological processes (BP) were identified and were grouped into  12 superclusters. The main BP found were involved in the response to biotic stimulus, gas transport, cellular activation, carbohydrate-derived catabolism, multi-organism regulation, immune system, muscle contraction, multi-organism process, cytolysis, leukocytes and cell adhesion. In this study, the first transcriptome analysis of the broilers femur articular cartilage was performed, and a set of candidate genes (AvBD1, AvBD2, ANK1, EPX, ADA, RHAG) that could trigger changes in the broiler´s femoral growth plate was identified. Moreover, these results could be helpful to better understand FHN in chickens and possibly  in humans.	0
35003230	Differentially Expressed lncRNAs Related to the Development of Abdominal Fat in Gushi Chickens and Their Interaction Regulatory Network.	Chickens are one of the most important sources of meat worldwide, and the growth  status of abdominal fat is closely related to production efficiency. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in lipid metabolism and deposition regulation. However, research on the expression profile of lncRNAs related to the development of abdominal fat in chickens after hatching and their  interaction regulatory networks is still lacking. To characterize the lncRNA expression profile during the development of chicken abdominal fat, abdominal adipose tissues from 6-, 14-, 22-, and 30-week-old Chinese Gushi chickens were herein used to construct 12 cDNA libraries, and a total of 3,827 new lncRNAs and  5,466 previously annotated lncRNAs were revealed. At the same time, based on the  comparative analysis of five combinations, 276 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DE-lncRNAs) were screened. Functional enrichment analysis showed that the predicted target genes of these DE-lncRNAs were significantly enriched in pathways related to the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression, negative regulation of cell proliferation, cell adhesion and other biological processes, glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, PPAR signaling, fatty acid degradation, fatty acid synthesis and others. In addition, association analysis of the lncRNA transcriptome profile was performed, and DE-lncRNA-related lncRNA-mRNA, lncRNA-miRNA and lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction regulatory networks were constructed. The results showed that DE-lncRNA formed a complex network with PPAR pathway components, including PPARD, ACOX1, ADIPOQ, CPT1A, FABP5, ASBG2, LPL, PLIN2 and related miRNAs, including mir-200b-3p, mir-130b-3p, mir-215-5p, mir-122-5p, mir-223 and mir-125b-5p, and played an important regulatory role in biological processes such as lipid metabolism, adipocyte proliferation and differentiation. This study described the dynamic expression profile of lncRNAs in the abdominal fat of Gushi chickens for the first time and constructed the DE-lncRNA interaction regulatory network. The results expand the number of known  lncRNAs in chicken abdominal fat and provide valuable resources for further elucidating the posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism of chicken abdominal fat development or deposition.	0
34864328	Survey of Salmonella in commercial broiler farms in Shiraz, southern Iran.	Salmonella is one of the major causes of food-borne diseases, worldwide. The aim  of the present study was to describe the prevalence of Salmonella and to employ a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to confirm the presence of Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium in the broiler chicken farms in Shiraz, southern Iran. In addition, risk factors for the presence of Salmonella spp. at farm and flock levels were investigated. Fecal samples were collected from 22 broiler farms, including 35 broiler flocks. Conventional culture methods were used for Salmonella isolation, and the suspected isolates were confirmed by PCR with Salmonella specific primer (invA). Subsequently, PCR was performed to identify S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium, using IE-1 and Flic-C primers, respectively. Information for farms and flocks was collected using a questionnaire. Twelve poultry flocks from eight farms were positive for Salmonella. The estimated prevalence of Salmonella was 36.4% at farm level and 34.3% at flock level. Based on the results of PCR, four farms were infected with  S. Enteritidis, two farms with S. Typhimurium and one farm with both serovars, concurrently. Statistical analysis using generalized estimating equations showed  that at flock level, odds of Salmonella presence increased when the number of chickens was more than 15000 (OR = 13.2, P = 0.023), and an increased odds of Salmonella was found for flocks in which antibiotics were used at sub-therapeutic or therapeutic doses during the rearing period (OR = 19.6, P = 0.003). At the farm level, there was a marginal association between Salmonella and using nipple  drinker (OR = 0.08, P = 0.07) and keeping dogs on the farm (OR = 8.9, P = 0.06) by logistic regression analysis. In conclusion, Salmonella spp. including S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium are prevalent in the poultry flocks in the region. Considering the results and the fact that the flock size and its surrogate marker, stocking density are among the most consistently identified risk factors  for Salmonella in the literature, production cycles with the appropriate number of chicks and proper stocking density are recommended. In addition, careful monitoring and prudent use of antibiotics in poultry farms could be practiced to  control this human pathogen in preharvest poultry operations.	0
35071376	S-Methylcysteine Ameliorates the Intestinal Damage Induced by Eimeria tenella Infection via Targeting Oxidative Stress and Inflammatory Modulators.	Avian coccidiosis is one of the major parasitic diseases in the poultry industry. The infection is caused by Eimeria species, and its treatment relies mainly on the administration of anticoccidial drugs, which can result in drug resistance and side effects. The recent trends in avian coccidiosis treatment is directed to the development of a new therapy using herbal compounds. S-Methylcysteine (SMC) is considered one of the organosulfur compounds in garlic that showed promising activity in the treatment of different pathological conditions via a wide range of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms. In this study, the anticoccidial activity of SMC was investigated in Eimeria tenella-infected chickens compared to diclazuril as a widely used anticoccidial drug. In this regard, 14-day-old broilers were divided into six groups (n = 18). The first group (G1) was the healthy control group, while the second group (G2) was the non-infected SMC group treated at a dose of 50 mg/kg b.w. (high dose). Moreover, the third group (G3) was the positive control group (infected and non-treated). The fourth group (G4)  was the infected group treated with SMC of 25 mg/kg b.w. (low dose), while the fifth group (G5) was the infected group treated with SMC of 50 mg/kg b.w. (high dose). Conversely, the sixth group (G6) was the diclazuril-treated group. The anticoccidial effects of SMC and diclazuril were evaluated by counting oocysts and recording the body weight gain, feed conversion ratio, clinical signs, lesions, and mortality rate. Interestingly, SMC showed potent anticoccidial activity, which was exemplified by reduction of oocyst count. Furthermore, the biochemical, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory parameters in the cecal tissues were restored toward their control levels in G4, G5, and G6. Histopathological observation of cecal tissues was consistent with the aforementioned results revealing the ameliorative effect of SMC against E. tenella infection. This study concluded novel findings in relation to the anticoccidial role of SMC as a plant-based compound against the E. tenella-induced coccidiosis in broiler chickens combined with its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Further studies for exploring the mechanistic pathways involved in this activity  and the potential benefits from its use in association with conventional anticoccidial drugs are warranted.	0
35290380	Whole-genome sequencing revealed genetic diversity and selection of Guangxi indigenous chickens.	Guangxi chickens play a crucial role in promoting the high-quality development of the broiler industry in China, but their value and potential are yet to be discovered. To determine the genetic diversity and population structure of Guangxi indigenous chicken, we analyzed the whole genomes of 185 chickens from 8  phenotypically and geographically representative Guangxi chicken breeds, together with 12 RJFt, 12 BRA and 12 WL genomes available from previous studies. Calculation of heterozygosity (Hp), nucleotide diversity (π), and LD level indicated that Guangxi populations were characterized by higher genetic diversity and lower differentiation than RJFt and commercial breeds except for HGFC. Population structure analysis also confirmed the introgression from commercial broiler breeds. Each population clustered together while the overall differentiation was slight. MA has the richest genetic diversity among all varieties. Selective sweep analysis revealed BCO2, EDN3 and other candidate genes had received strong selection in local breeds. These also provided novel breeding visual and data basis for future breeding.	0
35100979	Genome-wide run of homozygosity analysis reveals candidate genomic regions associated with environmental adaptations of Tibetan native chickens.	BACKGROUND: In Tibet, the two most important breeds are Tibetan chicken and Lhasa white chicken, and the duo exhibit specific adaptations to the high altitude thereby supplying proteins for humans living in the plateau. These breeds are partly included in the conservation plans because they represent important chicken genetic resources. However, the genetic diversity of these chickens is rarely investigated. Based on whole-genome sequencing data of 113 chickens from 4 populations of Tibetan chicken including Shigatse (SH), Nyemo (NM), Dagze (DZ) and Nyingchi (LZ), as well as Lhasa white (LW) chicken breed, we investigated the genetic diversity of these chicken breeds by genetic differentiation, run of homozygosity (ROH), genomic inbreeding and selection signature analyses. RESULTS: Our results revealed high genetic diversity across the five chicken populations. The linkage disequilibrium decay was highest in LZ, while subtle genetic differentiation was found between LZ and other populations (Fst ranging from 0.05 to 0.10). Furthermore, the highest ROH-based inbreeding estimate (FROH) of 0.11 was observed in LZ. In other populations, the FROH ranged from 0.04 to 0.06. In total, 74, 111, 62, 42 and 54 ROH islands containing SNPs ranked top 1%  for concurrency were identified in SH, NM, DZ, LZ and LW, respectively. Genes common to the ROH islands in the five populations included BDNF, CCDC34, LGR4, LIN7C, GLS, LOC101747789, MYO1B, STAT1 and STAT4. This suggested their essential  roles in adaptation of the chickens. We also identified a common candidate genomic region harboring AMY2A, NTNG1 and VAV3 genes in all populations. These genes had been implicated in digestion, neurite growth and high-altitude adaptation. CONCLUSIONS: High genetic diversity is observed in Tibetan native chickens. Inbreeding is more intense in the Nyingchi population which is also genetically distant from other chicken populations. Candidate genes in ROH islands are likely to be the drivers of adaptation to high altitude exhibited by the five Tibetan native chicken populations. Our findings contribute to the understanding of genetic diversity offer valuable insights for the genetic mechanism of adaptation, and provide veritable tools that can help in the design and implementation of breeding and conservation strategies for Tibetan native chickens.	0
35055138	Orofacial Cleft and Mandibular Prognathism-Human Genetics and Animal Models.	Many complex molecular interactions are involved in the process of craniofacial development. Consequently, the network is sensitive to genetic mutations that may result in congenital malformations of varying severity. The most common birth anomalies within the head and neck are orofacial clefts (OFCs) and prognathism. Orofacial clefts are disorders with a range of phenotypes such as the cleft of the lip with or without cleft palate and isolated form of cleft palate with unilateral and bilateral variations. They may occur as an isolated abnormality (nonsyndromic-NSCLP) or coexist with syndromic disorders. Another cause of malformations, prognathism or skeletal class III malocclusion, is characterized by the disproportionate overgrowth of the mandible with or without the hypoplasia of maxilla. Both syndromes may be caused by the presence of environmental factors, but the majority of them are hereditary. Several mutations are linked to those phenotypes. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge regarding the genetics of those phenotypes and describe genotype-phenotype correlations. We then present the animal models used to study these defects.	0
34867866	Risk Factors and Prevalence of mcr-1-Positive Escherichia coli in Fecal Carriages Among Community Children in Southern Taiwan.	Colistin is the last resort antimicrobial for treating multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections. The plasmid-mediated colistin resistance gene, mcr-1, crucially influences colistin's resistance transmission. Human fecal carriages of mcr-1-positive Escherichia coli (E. coli) were detected in many regions worldwide; however, only a few studies have focused on children. Therefore, we identified the prevalence and risk factors of mcr-1-positive E. coli in fecal carriages among community children in Southern Taiwan. In this study, 510 stool samples were collected from April 2016 to August 2019 from the pediatric department at a medical center in Southern Taiwan. These samples were collected within 3 days after admission and were all screened for the presence of the mcr-1 gene. Diet habits, travel history, pet contact, and medical history were also obtained from participants to analyze the risk factors of their fecal carriages to mcr-1-positive E. coli. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was determined using the VITEK 2 system and the broth microdilution test. Twelve mcr-1-positive E. coli. were isolated from 2.4% of the fecal samples. Through multivariate analysis, frequent chicken consumption (at least 3 times per week) had a significantly positive association with the presence of mcr-1-positive E. coli in fecal carriages (adjust odds ratio 6.60, 95% confidence interval1.58- 27.62, p = 0.033). Additionally, multidrug resistance was more common in mcr-1-positive E. coli. (75.0% vs. 39.5%, p = 0.031) than in non-mcr-1-positive Escherichia coli. Furthermore, the percentage of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli in mcr-1-positive isolates was 83.3%. Some multi-locus sequence types in our mcr-1-positive E. coli were also similar to those isolated from food animals in the literature. The prevalence of fecal carriages of mcr-1-positive E. coli was low among community children in Southern Taiwan. Our data shows that chicken consumption with a higher frequency increases the risk of mcr-1-positive E. coli. in fecal carriages.	0
35299951	Genome-Wide Association Studies Provide Insight Into the Genetic Determination for Hyperpigmentation of the Visceral Peritoneum in Broilers.	Hyperpigmentation of the visceral peritoneum (HVP) has been becoming one of the most challenging problems in yellow-feathered chicken production, which seriously affected chicken carcass quality traits. Detecting which genes dominantly impact  pigmentation in the peritoneum tissues is of great benefit to the genetic improvement of HVP. To investigate the genetic mechanism of HVP in yellow-feathered broilers, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) were conducted in the F2 generation of a cross broiler population with 395 birds. A total of 115,706 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 122,415 were retained to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated to HVP in chicken. The GWAS results based on the logistic mixed model (LMM) revealed that a narrow genomic location on chromosomes 1 (49.2-51.3 Mb) was significantly associated (p ≤ 4.32 × 10-7) with HVP, which contained 23 SNP makers related to 14 functional genes (MFNG, POLDIP3, POLR2F, PICK1, PDXP, SGSM3, RANGAP1, MYH9, RPL3, GALP3, LGALS1, MICALL1, ATF4, and CYP2D6). Four highly associated (p < 10-5) haplotype blocks of 0.80 kb (two SNPs), 0.06 kb (two SNPs), 0.95 kb (two SNPs), and 0.03 kb (two SNPs) were identified with two, two, four, and four distinct haplotypes, respectively. As a melanoma-associated gene, CYP2D6 were also possibly involved in the development of HVP occurring in chicken with two significant variations (rs314284996 and rs317955795) in the promoter regions. Further tests revealed that the expression of CYP2D6 was obviously higher in the visceral peritoneum tissue of chicken with HVP than that in the normal group (p < 0.05). Our results  provide a novel clue to understand the genetic mechanism of HVP generation in chicken, and the mapped QTL or candidate genes might serve for genomic selection  to improve carcass quality in the yellow-feathered chicken industry.	0
35000932	Colonic Chicken Skin Mucosa Surrounding Colon Polyps Is an Endoscopic Predictive  Marker for Colonic Neoplastic Polyps.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Narrow band imaging provides an accurate diagnosis of colonic polyps. However, these diagnostic modalities are not used as standard endoscopic  tools in most institutions. This study aims to investigate whether the chicken skin mucosa (CSM) surrounding the colon polyp yields additional information about colorectal polyps, including histological differentiation of neoplastic and non-neoplastic polyps, under conventional white light colonoscopy. METHODS: This study prospectively observed 173 patients who underwent endoscopic  polypectomy and reviewed the clinical data and pathologic reports of 313 polyps from a university hospital. Two endoscopists each performed colonoscopy and polypectomy and assessed the CSM. The association between CSM surrounding colorectal polyps and histology was analyzed. RESULTS: The majority (91.3%) of CSM-positive polyps were neoplastic (sensitivity, 37.90%; specificity, 86.15%; p<0.001). In logistic regression, the  neoplastic polyps were associated with positive CSM (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45 to 9.25; p=0.007), protruded polyps (adjusted OR, 4.85; 95% CI, 1.65 to 17.23; p=0.008), and neoplastic histology-associated pit pattern (pit III, IV, and V) (adjusted OR, 10.14; 95% CI, 4.85 to 22.12; p=0.000). Furthermore, advanced adenomas were associated with  positive CSM (adjusted OR, 5.64; 95% CI, 1.77 to 20.28; p=0.005), protruded polyps (adjusted OR, 3.30; 95% CI, 1.15 to 9.74; p= 0.026), and ≥10 cm polyp size (adjusted OR, 18.56; 95% CI, 3.89 to 147.01; p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Neoplastic and advanced polyps were associated with CSM-positive polyps. These findings suggest that CSM is a useful marker in differentiating neoplastic polyps and advanced polyps under conventional white colonoscopy.	0
35063827	Salmonella Typhimurium lacking phoBR as a live vaccine candidate against poultry  infection.	Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, with a broad-host range, is a predominant cause of non-typhoidal Salmonella infection in humans, and the infectious source is highly associated with food animals, especially poultry. Considering the horizontal transmission of S. Typhimurium from farm animals to humans, vaccination has been strongly recommended in industrial animals. In an effort to eradicate S. Typhimurium in poultry farms, a live candidate vaccine strain lacking the phoBR genes, which encode the PhoB/PhoR two-component regulatory system responsible for cellular phosphate signaling, was evaluated in  mice and chickens. Lack of the phoBR genes promoted overgrowth of intracellular Salmonella. However, notably, in BALB/c mouse models, the ΔphoBR mutant showed attenuated virulence and instead, provided protection against infection with virulent Salmonella, thereby clearing out Salmonella in the spleen and liver. Accordingly, immunization with the ΔphoBR mutant increased immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM antibody responses and also tended to increase the IgG2a/IgG1 ratio, which is indicative of T helper (Th)1-mediated cellular immunity. In chicken challenge models, immunization with the ΔphoBR mutant significantly boosted the production of IgG and IgM antibodies after the second vaccination. The vaccinated chickens ceased fecal shedding of challenged Salmonella earlier than the non-vaccinated ones and showed no Salmonella in their caecum and ileum. These results demonstrate the potential of the S. Typhimurium ΔphoBR mutant as a vaccine in chickens.	0
34944274	Association of Heterophil/Lymphocyte Ratio with Intestinal Barrier Function and Immune Response to Salmonella enteritidis Infection in Chicken.	The heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio has been extensively studied to select poultry that are resistant to environmental stressors. Chickens with a low H/L ratio are superior to the chickens with a high H/L ratio in survival, immune response, and resistance to Salmonella infection. However, this disease resistance ability is likely to be associated with enhanced intestinal immunity.  Therefore, to expand our understanding of these underlying resistance mechanisms, it is crucial to investigate the correlation between the H/L ratio as a blood immune indicator in live chickens and the intestinal barrier function and immunity. Jinxing yellow chickens H/L line one-day-old were divided into non-infected (NI) and Salmonella enteritidis infected (SI) at 7-days old. After dividing the birds into NI and SI, blood samples were taken for H/L ratios determination, and subsequently, birds from the SI group were infected with Salmonella enteritidis (SE). We assessed the effects of SE infection on the (i) goblet cells number from the ileum and caecum gut-segments, (ii) ileal mucosa morphology, and (iii) immune gene mRNA expressions from the ileum and caecum of NI and SI chickens at 7 and 21 days-post-infection (dpi). We found that the H/L ratio was negatively correlated with most intestinal immune indices, particularly with the goblet cells number and with IL-1β, IL-8, and IFN-γ ileal expressions. In conclusion, these results suggest that the H/L ratio is associated with the intestinal barrier and immune response for SE clearance and that the chickens with a low H/L ratio displayed enhanced intestinal immunity. This study expands the current knowledge that is related to using the H/L ratio to select and breed  resistant broiler chickens.	0
34534851	The digestive and reproductive tract microbiotas and their association with body  weight in laying hens.	Body weight at the onset of egg production is a major factor influencing hen productivity, as suitable body weight is crucial to laying performance in laying  hens. To better understand the association between body weight and microbial community membership and structure in different sites of the digestive and reproductive tracts in chickens, we performed 16S rRNA sequencing surveys and focused on how the microbiota may interact to influence body weight. Our results  demonstrated that the microbial community and structure of the digestive and reproductive tracts differed between low and high body weight groups. In particular, we found that the species Pseudomonas viridiflava was negatively associated with body weight in the 3 digestive tract sites, while Bacteroides salanitronis was negatively associated with body weight in the 3 reproductive tract sites; and further in-depth studies are needed to explore their function. These findings will help extend our understanding of the influence of the bird digestive and reproductive tract microbiotas on body weight trait and provide future directions regarding the control of body weight in the production of laying hens.	0
34571753	Unveiling Comparative Genomic Trajectories of Selection and Key Candidate Genes in Egg-Type Russian White and Meat-Type White Cornish Chickens.	Comparison of genomic footprints in chicken breeds with different selection history is a powerful tool in elucidating genomic regions that have been targeted by recent and more ancient selection. In the present work, we aimed at examining  and comparing the trajectories of artificial selection in the genomes of the native egg-type Russian White (RW) and meat-type White Cornish (WC) breeds. Combining three different statistics (top 0.1% SNP by FST value at pairwise breed comparison, hapFLK analysis, and identification of ROH island shared by more than 50% of individuals), we detected 45 genomic regions under putative selection including 11 selective sweep regions, which were detected by at least two different methods. Four of such regions were breed-specific for each of RW breed  (on GGA1, GGA5, GGA8, and GGA9) and WC breed (on GGA1, GGA5, GGA8, and GGA28), while three remaining regions on GGA2 (two sweeps) and GGA3 were common for both  breeds. Most of identified genomic regions overlapped with known QTLs and/or candidate genes including those for body temperatures, egg productivity, and feed intake in RW chickens and those for growth, meat and carcass traits, and feed efficiency in WC chickens. These findings were concordant with the breed origin and history of their artificial selection. We determined a set of 188 prioritized candidate genes retrieved from the 11 overlapped regions of putative selection and reviewed their functions relative to phenotypic traits of interest in the two breeds. One of the RW-specific sweep regions harbored the known domestication gene, TSHR. Gene ontology and functional annotation analysis provided additional  insight into a functional coherence of genes in the sweep regions. We also showed a greater candidate gene richness on microchromosomes relative to macrochromosomes in these genomic areas. Our results on the selection history of  RW and WC chickens and their key candidate genes under selection serve as a profound information for further conservation of their genomic diversity and efficient breeding.	0
35117983	Seroprevalence and Associated Risk Factors of Infectious Bursal Disease in Chickens Managed Under Intensive and Backyard Production Systems in Western Oromia, Ethiopia.	BACKGROUND: Infectious bursal disease (IBD) is a highly contagious viral disease  challenging poultry industry throughout the world. It is also among the main obstacles in the different chicken production system in Ethiopia. This study was  conducted with the aim of determining seroprevalence and associated risk factors  of IBD in backyard and intensively managed chickens of the study area. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in selected districts of western Oromia on intensive and backyard production systems to investigate seroprevalence of IBD and associated risk factors from September 2020 to August 2021. A total of 384 chickens of either sex, 128 from each district, were included from three randomly selected peasant associations (PAs). In addition, 180 individual poultry keepers, of both sexes, and different educational backgrounds, were included for  questionnaire survey (Supplementary Material). Data were analyzed using SPSS Version-20, and results were presented as percentages. The samples were processed by using (ProFLOKIBV, USA) indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (I-ELISA) kits. RESULTS: Out of 384 serum samples tested, 66.93% (n = 257) were found positive by indirect ELISA. The highest prevalence was recorded from Sasiga district Balo Bareda PA. Prevalence of IBD showed significant statistical association (p < 0.05) among owner education level, chicken rearing practice, origin and breed. Questionnaire survey results showed the majority of respondents lack sufficient knowledge about IBD and other chicken diseases. The practice of backyard chicken  producers on vaccination and treatment of sick birds is limited. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, IBD is a major factor hindering production and health  of birds. Proper vaccination programs coordinated with awareness creation of chicken owners on how to isolate and treat sick birds should be implemented.	0
34788357	Meat consumption and gastric cancer risk: the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study.	BACKGROUND: The association of meat consumption with gastric cancer is inconclusive. OBJECTIVES: We examined the association of meat consumption with gastric cancer risk among Japanese men and women. METHODS: This cohort study included 42,328 male and 48,176 female participants of the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study, who were aged 45 to 74 y  at recruitment. Dietary intake data were collected from 1 January 1995 to 31 December 1999 using a validated food-frequency questionnaire. HRs and 95% CIs for gastric cancer were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 15 y, 1868 male and 833 female incident gastric cancer cases were identified. Intake of total and subtypes of meat was not associated with total gastric cancer. However, higher chicken consumption was associated with reduced distal gastric cancer risk in women (HR for quintile 5 vs. quintile 1: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.99; P-trend = 0.027), with a similar but nonsignificant risk reduction among women with Helicobacter pylori (HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.29, 1.20; P-trend = 0.06) in subgroup analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Meat consumption was not associated with total gastric cancer risk.	0
35401685	Genetic Parameter Estimation and Whole Sequencing Analysis of the Genetic Architecture of Chicken Keel Bending.	"Bone health is particularly important for high-yielding commercial layer chickens. The keel of poultry is an extension of the abdomen side of the sternum  along the sagittal plane and is one of the most important bones. In this study, the keel phenotype of White Leghorns laying hen flocks showed significant individual differences. To clarify its genetic mechanism, we first estimated the  heritability of keel bend (KB) in White Leghorn, recorded the production performance of the chicken flock, examined the blood biochemical indexes and bone quality in KB and keel normal (KN) chickens, and performed whole-genome pooled sequencing in KB and KN chickens. We then performed selection elimination analysis to determine the genomic regions that may affect the keel phenotypes. The results show that KB is a medium heritability trait. We found that cage height had a significant effect on the KB (p < 0.01). At 48 weeks, there were significant differences in the number of eggs, the number of normal eggs, and eggshell strength (p < 0.05). The content of parathyroid hormone was lower (p < 0.01) and that of calcitonin was higher (p < 0.01) in KB chickens than in KN chickens. The differences in bone mineral density, bone strength, and bone cortical thickness of the humerus and femur were extremely significant (p < 0.01), with all being lower in KB chickens than in KN chickens. In addition, the  bones of KB chickens contained more fat organization. A total of 128 genes were identified in selective sweep regions. We identified 10 important candidate genes: ACP5, WNT1, NFIX, CNN1, CALR, FKBP11, TRAPPC5, MAP2K7, RELA, and ENSGALG00000047166. Among the significantly enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes  and Genomes pathways found, we identifed two bone-related pathways, one involving ""osteoclast differentiation"" and the other the ""MAPK signaling pathway."" These results may help us better understand the molecular mechanism of bone traits in chickens and other birds and provide new insights for the genetic breeding of chickens."	0
34530512	Optimal population size to detect quantitative trait loci in Korean native chicken: a simulation study.	OBJECTIVE: A genomic region associated with a particular phenotype is called quantitative trait loci (QTL). To detect the optimal F2 population size associated with QTLs in native chicken, we performed a simulation study on F2 population derived from crosses between two different breeds. METHODS: A total of 15 males and 150 females were randomly selected from the last generation of each F1 population which was composed of different breed to create  two different F2 populations. The progenies produced from these selected individuals were simulated for six more generations. Their marker genotypes were  simulated with a density of 50K at three different heritability levels for the traits such as 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5. Our study compared 100, 500, 1,000 reference population (RP) groups to each other with three different heritability levels. And a total of 35 QTLs were used, and their locations were randomly created. RESULTS: With a RP size of 100, no QTL was detected to satisfy Bonferroni value at three different heritability levels. In a RP size of 500, two QTLs were detected when the heritability was 0.5. With a RP size of 1,000, 0.1 heritability was detected only one QTL, and 0.5 heritability detected five QTLs. To sum up, RP size and heritability play a key role in detecting QTLs in a QTL study. The larger RP size and greater heritability value, the higher the probability of detection of QTLs. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the use of a large RP and heritability can improve QTL detection in an F2 chicken population.	0
35251489	The Chicken and Egg of Pride and Social Rank.	Prior research has found an association between pride experiences and social rank outcomes. However, the causal direction of this relationship remains unclear. The current research used a longitudinal design (N = 1,653) to investigate whether pride experiences are likely to be a cause, consequence, or both, of social rank  outcomes, by tracking changes in individuals' pride and social rank over time. Prior research also has uncovered distinct correlational relationships between the two facets of pride, authentic and hubristic, and two forms of social rank, prestige and dominance, respectively. We therefore separately examined longitudinal relationships between each pride facet and each form of social rank. Results reveal distinct bidirectional relationships between authentic pride and prestige and hubristic pride and dominance, suggesting that specific kinds of pride experiences and specific forms of social rank are both an antecedent and a  consequence of one another.	0
35246679	Palatability and apparent total tract macronutrient digestibility of retorted black soldier fly larvae-containing diets and their effects on the fecal characteristics of cats consuming them.	There is a growing interest in using black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) due to its supposed sustainability and nutritional qualities. Because little research has been conducted to evaluate the use of BSFL in cats, our objective was to determine the palatability and apparent total tract macronutrient digestibility (ATTD) of BSFL-containing canned diets and the fecal characteristics of healthy adult cats consuming them. First, three palatability tests were conducted to compare the following diets: 1) diet with poultry byproduct meal (PBPM) and chicken serving as the primary protein sources (control) vs. diet with BSFL meal  replacing PBPM (BSFL meal); 2) control vs. diet with whole BSFL replacing some PBPM and poultry fat (BSFL whole); and 3) control vs. diet with BSFL oil replacing poultry fat (BSFL oil). All diets were formulated to meet Association of American Feed Control Officials nutrient profiles for adult cats and were produced using a still retort. A paired t-test was conducted to analyze data from each palatability test, with a higher (P < 0.05) consumption ratio being observed for BSFL meal (1.93:1), BSFL whole (2.03:1), and BSFL oil (1.57:1). Second, 32 adult cats (20 females and 12 males; BW: 4.19 ± 0.55 kg; age: 3.3 ± 0.38 yr) were used in a completely randomized design study composed of a 21-d baseline period and a 70-d experimental period. Cats consumed the control diet during the baseline and were then allotted to one of four experimental diets (n = 8 per group): 1) control, 2) BSFL meal, 3) whole BSFL, and 4) BSFL oil. Fecal samples were collected after baseline and experimental periods for ATTD and fecal characteristic analysis. Fecal output was higher (P < 0.05) and fecal dry matter  percentage was lower (P < 0.05) in cats fed BSFL meal than those fed BSFL oil. Organic matter, crude protein (CP), and energy ATTD were lower (P < 0.05) in cats fed BSFL meal than those fed BSFL oil or control. CP and energy ATTD were lower (P < 0.05) in cats fed BSFL whole than those fed BSFL oil. A few serum metabolites were affected by diet (P < 0.05) but remained within reference ranges. Hematology was not affected by diet (P > 0.05). Overall, our results suggest that BSFL-containing diets are palatable and do not negatively affect fecal characteristics or serum chemistry but may have slightly lower nutrient digestibilities in adult cats.	0
34484301	Genetic Diversity of MHC B-F/B-L Region in 21 Chicken Populations.	The chicken major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 16 is the most polymorphic region across the whole genome, and also an ideal model for genetic diversity investigation. The MHC B-F/B-L region is 92 kb in length with high GC content consisting of 18 genes and one pseudogene (Blec4), which plays important  roles in immune response. To evaluate polymorphism of the Chinese indigenous chickens as well as to analyze the effect of selection to genetic diversity, we used WaferGen platform to identify sequence variants of the B-F/B-L region in 21  chicken populations, including the Red Jungle Fowl (RJF), Cornish (CS), White Leghorns (WLs), 16 Chinese domestic breeds, and two well-known inbred lines 63 and 72. A total of 3,319 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and 181 INDELs in  the B-F/B-L region were identified among 21 populations, of which 2,057 SNPs (62%) and 159 INDELs (88%) were novel. Most of the variants were within the intron and the flanking regions. The average variation density was 36 SNPs and 2  INDELs per kb, indicating dramatical high diversity of this region. Furthermore,  BF2 was identified as the hypervariable genes with 67 SNPs per kb. Chinese domestic populations showed higher diversity than the WLs and CS. The indigenous  breeds, Nandan Yao (NY), Xishuangbanna Game (XG), Gushi (GS), and Xiayan (XY) chickens, were the top four with the highest density of SNPs and INDELs. The highly inbred lines 63 and 72 have the lowest diversity, which might be resulted  from a long-term intense selection for decades. Collectively, we refined the genetic map of chicken MHC B-F/B-L region, and illustrated genetic diversity of 21 chicken populations. Abundant genetic variants were identified, which not only strikingly expanded the current Ensembl SNP database, but also provided comprehensive data for researchers to further investigate association between variants in MHC and immune traits.	0
34599202	L. rhamnosus improves the immune response and tryptophan catabolism in laying hen pullets.	In mammals, early-life probiotic supplementation is a promising tool for preventing unfavourable, gut microbiome-related behavioural, immunological, and aromatic amino acid alterations later in life. In laying hens, feather-pecking behaviour is proposed to be a consequence of gut-brain axis dysregulation. Lactobacillus rhamnosus decreases stress-induced severe feather pecking in adult  hens, but whether its effect in pullets is more robust is unknown. Consequently,  we investigated whether early-life, oral supplementation with a single Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain can prevent stress-induced feather-pecking behaviour in chickens. To this end, we monitored both the short- and long-term effects of the probiotic supplement on behaviour and related physiological parameters. We hypothesized that L. rhamnosus would reduce pecking behaviour by modulating the biological pathways associated with this detrimental behaviour, namely aromatic amino acid turnover linked to neurotransmitter production and stress-related immune responses. We report that stress decreased the proportion of cytotoxic T cells in the tonsils (P = 0.047). Counteracting this T cell depression, birds receiving the L. rhamnosus supplementation significantly increased all T lymphocyte subset proportions (P < 0.05). Both phenotypic and genotypic feather peckers had lower plasma tryptophan concentrations compared to  their non-pecking counterparts. The probiotic supplement caused a short-term increase in plasma tryptophan (P < 0.001) and the TRP:(PHE + TYR) ratio (P < 0.001). The administration of stressors did not significantly increase feather pecking in pullets, an observation consistent with the age-dependent onset of pecking behaviour. Despite minimal changes to behaviour, our data demonstrate the impact of L. rhamnosus supplementation on the immune system and the turnover of the serotonin precursor tryptophan. Our findings indicate that L. rhamnosus exerts a transient, beneficial effect on the immune response and tryptophan catabolism in pullets.	0
34980288	Performance of distinct microbial based solutions in a Campylobacter infection challenge model in poultry.	BACKGROUND: Antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) are commonly used within poultry production to improve feed conversion, bird growth, and reduce morbidity and mortality from clinical and subclinical diseases. Due to the association between  AGP usage and rising antimicrobial resistance, the industry has explored new strategies including the use of probiotics and other microbial-based interventions to promote the development of a healthy microbiome in birds and mitigate against infections associated with food safety and food security. While  previous studies have largely focused on the ability of probiotics to protect against Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella enterica, much less is known concerning their impact on Campylobacter jejuni, a near commensal of the chicken  gut microbiome that nevertheless is a major cause of food poisoning in humans. RESULTS: Here we compare the efficacy of four microbial interventions (two single strain probiotics, the bacterium-Pediococcus acidilactici, and the yeast-Saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii; and two complex, competitive exclusion, consortia-Aviguard and CEL) to bacitracin, a commonly used AGP, to modulate chicken gut microbiota and subsequently impact C. jejuni infection in poultry. Cecal samples were harvested at 30- and 39-days post hatch to assess Campylobacter burden and examine their impact on the gut microbiota. While the different treatments did not significantly decrease C. jejuni burden relative to  the untreated controls, both complex consortia resulted in significant decreases  relative to treatment with bacitracin. Analysis of 16S rDNA profiles revealed a distinct microbial signature associated with each microbial intervention. For example, treatment with Aviguard and CEL increased the relative abundance of Bacteroidaceae and Rikenellaceae respectively. Furthermore, Aviguard promoted a less complex microbial community compared to other treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Depending upon the individual needs of the producer, our results illustrate the potential of each microbial interventions to serve flock-specific  requirements.	0
35215968	A Novel Recombinant FAdV-4 Virus with Fiber of FAdV-8b Provides Efficient Protection against Both FAdV-4 and FAdV-8b.	Since 2015, the outbreaks of hydropericardium-hepatitis syndrome (HHS) and inclusion body hepatitis (IBH) caused by the highly pathogenic serotype 4 fowl adenovirus (FAdV-4) and serotype 8 fowl adenovirus (FAdV-8), respectively, have caused huge economic losses to the poultry industry. Although several vaccines have been developed to control HHS or IBH, a recombinant genetic engineering vaccine against both FAdV-4 and FAdV-8 has not been reported. In this study, recombinant FAdV-4 expressing the fiber of FAdV-8b, designated as FA4-F8b, expressing fiber of FAdV-8b was generated by the CRISPR-Cas9 and homologous recombinant techniques. Infection studies in vitro and in vivo revealed that the  FA4-F8b replicated efficiently in LMH cells and was also highly pathogenic to 2-week-old SPF chickens. Moreover, the inoculation of inactivated the FA4-F8b in  chickens could not only induce highly neutralizing antibodies, but also provide efficient protection against both FAdV-4 and FAdV-8b. All these demonstrate that  the inactivated recombinant FA4-F8b generated here can act as a vaccine candidate to control HHS and IBH, and FAdV-4 can be an efficient vaccine vector to deliver  foreign antigens.	0
35205354	Identification of Candidate Genes for Meat Color of Chicken by Combing Selection  Signature Analyses and Differentially Expressed Genes.	Meat color, an important index of chicken quality, is highly related to heme pigment, glycolysis, and intramuscular fat metabolisms. The objective of this study is to obtain candidate genes associated with meat color in chickens based on the comparison of fast-growing, white-feathered chickens (Line B) and slow-growing, yellow-feathered chickens (Jingxing Yellow), which have significant differences in meat color. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between Line B and Jingxing Yellow were identified in beast muscle. The fixation index (FST) method was used to detect signatures of positive selection between the two breeds. Screening of 1109 genes by the FST and 1317 candidate DEGs identified by  RNA-seq. After gene ontology analysis along with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes  and Genomes, 16 genes associated with glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, protein  metabolism, and heme content were identified as candidate genes that regulate the color of chicken breast meat, especially TBXAS1 (redness), GDPD5 (yellowness), SLC2A6 (lightness), and MMP27 (lightness). These findings should be helpful for further elucidating the molecular mechanisms and developing molecular markers to  facilitate the selection of chicken meat color.	0
34959155	Eggshell decalcification and skeletal mineralization during chicken embryonic development: defining candidate genes in the chorioallantoic membrane.	During chicken embryonic development, skeleton calcification mainly relies on the eggshell, whose minerals are progressively solubilized and transported to the embryo via the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). However, the molecular components  involved in this process remain undefined. We assessed eggshell demineralization  and calcification of the embryo skeleton after 12 and 16 d of incubation, and analyzed the expression of several candidate genes in the CAM: carbonic anhydrases that are likely involved in secretion of protons for eggshell dissolution (CA2, CA4, CA9), ions transporters and regulators (CALB1, SLC4A1, ATP6V1B2, SGK1, SCGN, PKD2) and vitamin-D binding protein (GC). Our results confirmed that eggshell weight, thickness, and strength decreased during incubation, with a concomitant increase in calcification of embryonic skeletal system. In the CAM, the expression of CA2 increased during incubation while CA4 and CA9 were expressed at similar levels at both stages. SCL4A1 and SCGN were expressed, but not differentially, between the two stages, while the expression of ATP6V1B2 and PKD2 genes decreased. The expression of SGK1 and TRPV6 increased  over time, although the expression of the latter gene was barely detectable. In parallel, we analyzed the expression of these candidate genes in the yolk sac (YS), which mediates the transfer of yolk minerals to the embryo during the first half of incubation. In YS, CA2 expression increases during incubation, similar to the CAM, while the expression of the other candidate genes decreases. Moreover, CALB1 and GC genes were found to be expressed during incubation in the YS, in contrast to the CAM where no expression of either was detected. This study demonstrates that the regulation of genes involved in the mobilization of egg minerals during embryonic development is different between the YS and CAM extraembryonic structures. Identification of the full suite of molecular components involved in the transfer of eggshell calcium to the embryo via the CAM should help to better understand the role of this structure in bone mineralization.	0
35326758	Categorisation of Antimicrobial Use in Fijian Livestock Production Systems.	Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global threat to human and animal health. The use of antimicrobials in the livestock sector is considered to contribute to AMR. Therefore, a reduction in and prudent use of antimicrobials in livestock production systems have been advocated. This cross-sectional survey aimed to investigate the extent of imprudent antimicrobial use (AMU) and to determine whether the AMU practice was affected by either the farming system or species of farmed livestock in the largest island (Viti Levu) of Fiji. A total of 276 livestock enterprises were surveyed and antimicrobials were used on 309 occasions over 90 days. Overall, in 298 of 309 (96%) incidents, antimicrobials were used imprudently, comprising antibiotics, 160 of 170 (94%) and anthelmintics, 138 of 139 (99%). Prudent use of antibiotics was associated with commercial farming systems (X2 = 13, p = 0.001), but no association was observed  with anthelmintic use (p &gt; 0.05). Imprudent antibiotic use was associated with dairy (OR = 7.6, CI = 1.41, 41.57, p = 0.018) followed by layer and beef (p &gt;  0.05) compared to broiler enterprises. Imprudent AMU was more common in the backyard and semi-commercial enterprises compared to commercial broiler enterprises. Policies promoting the prudent use of antimicrobials in Fiji should  focus on smaller livestock production systems and enterprises.	0
34869728	Evaluation of Safety and Protective Efficacy of a waaJ and spiC Double Deletion Korean Epidemic Strain of Salmonella enterica Serovar Gallinarum.	With an aim to develop a highly attenuated and strongly immunogenic distinguishable vaccine candidate, a waaJ (a gene involved in the synthesis of lipopolysaccharide) and spiC (a virulence gene) double deletion Korean epidemic strain of S. enterica ser. Gallinarum (SG005) was constructed. Our results showed that the growth and biochemical characteristics were not altered by this double deletion. The double deletion strain contained dual markers. One was a bacteriological marker (rough phenotype) and the other was a serological marker helping distinguish infected chickens from vaccinated chickens. The double deletion strain showed good genetic stability and reduced resistance to environmental stresses in vitro; furthermore, it was extremely safe and highly avirulent in broilers. Single intramuscular or oral immunization of 7-day-old broilers with the double deletion strain could stimulate the body to produce antibody levels similar to the conventional vaccine strain SG9R. In addition, against a lethal wild-type challenge, it conferred effective protection that was  comparable to that seen in the group vaccinated with SG9R. In conclusion, this double deletion strain may be an effective vaccine candidate for controlling S. enterica ser. Gallinarum infection in broilers.	0
34563266	Interaction of Salmonella Gallinarum and Salmonella Enteritidis with peripheral leucocytes of hens with different laying performance.	Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica serovars Enteritidis (SE) and Gallinarum (SG) cause different diseases in chickens. However, both are able to reach the blood stream where heterophils and monocytes are potentially able to phagocytose and kill the pathogens. Using an ex vivo chicken whole blood infection model, we compared the complex interactions of the differentially host-adapted SE and SG with immune cells in blood samples of two White Leghorn chicken lines showing different laying performance (WLA: high producer; R11: low producer). In order to examine the dynamic interaction between peripheral blood leucocytes and the Salmonella serovars, we performed flow cytometric analyses and survival assays measuring (i) leucocyte numbers, (ii) pathogen association with immune cells, (iii) Salmonella viability and (iv) immune gene transcription in infected whole blood over a four-hour co-culture period. Inoculation of blood from the two chicken lines with Salmonella led primarily to an interaction of the bacteria with monocytes, followed by heterophils and thrombocytes. We found higher proportions of monocytes associated with SE than with SG. In blood samples of high producing chickens, a decrease in the numbers of both heterophils and Salmonella was observed. The Salmonella challenge induced transcription of interleukin-8 (IL-8) which was more pronounced in SG- than SE-inoculated blood of R11. In conclusion, the stronger interaction of monocytes with SE than SG and the better survivability of Salmonella in blood of low-producer chickens shows that the host-pathogen interaction and the strength of the immune defence depend on both the Salmonella serovar and the chicken line.	0
35271885	Identification of Marek's disease virus pUL56 homologue and analysis of critical  amino acid stretches indispensable for its intracellular localization.	Marek's disease virus (MDV) is considered a unique member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily that induces rapid onset of T cell lymphoma in chickens. Compared with other conserved UL56 gene homologues of herpesviruses, little is known about the roles of MDV UL56 gene, while recent studies of mammalian herpesvirus pUL56 proteins have revealed their involvement in promoting ubiquitination of the Nedd4 (neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 4) -like E3 ubiquitin ligases for proteasomal degradation  and in modulating host immune responses. To determine the expression kinetics of  UL56 gene products, chicken embryo fibroblasts were infected with very virulent or attenuated MDV strain and analyzed by quantitative PCR and Western blotting. During the time course of infection, the levels of UL56 mRNA transcripts increased consistently. At the translational level, the pUL56 protein encoded by  UL56 gene was expressed in the size of 32 kDa, which emerged as early as 12 h post-infection (hpi) but otherwise began to wane at 72 hpi thereafter. With the treatment of viral DNA synthesis inhibitors, the pUL56 expression was significantly reduced, featuring the dynamics of a late (γ)-gene product. By confocal imaging, pUL56 was found to reside in the Golgi compartment. Both the L-domain motifs and the C-terminal tail-anchored transmembrane were essential for its intracellular localization. Noticeably, pUL56 co-localized with a truncated mutant of the chicken Nedd4-like family protein harboring only the WW domains; however, co-immunoprecipitation assay established no direct interaction between them, and the ectopic expression of pUL56 did not alter the abundance of endogenous Nedd4-like protein. Overall, the present study provides a caveat that  the pUL56 homologues of different herpesviruses with structural similarities might vary in expression patterns and probably in functional consequences. For this reason, further investigation should be encouraged to focus on the potential association between UL56 gene and MDV pathogenesis in the context of engineered viral mutants.	0
35205371	A Deletion Upstream of SOX10 Causes Light Yellow Plumage Colour in Chicken.	Chicken plumage colour is a complex trait controlled by many genes. Herein, through Rhode Island Red (RIR) and White Leghorn (WL) F1 cross populations, the segregation of plumage color was observed in females, showing white in males, and dark red (DR) and light yellow (LY) in females. The white has been found to be caused by dominant white alleles (I) and the DR phenotype is attributed to a sex-linked recessive silver allele (S∗S). LY is a derived feather colour phenotype and the genetic mechanism of this is unclear. In order to explore the genetic basis for LY, we randomly selected 40 DR and 39 LY chickens for paired-end sequencing. Through the use of association analysis, we found the LY phenotype is caused by a 7.6 kb non-coding deletion near the SOX10 gene. This mutation has been reported to be responsible for dark brown plumage in chicken, and subsequent diagnostic PCR tests showed that the length of the long-range non-coding deletion is 7.6 kb instead of 8.3 kb as previously reported.	0
35024351	Seroepidemiology of Infectious Bursal Disease in Poultry Reared Under Backyard Production System in Wolaita Zone, Southern Ethiopia.	BACKGROUND: Infectious bursal disease (IBD) has been known to cause high morbidity and mortality in chickens resulting in considerable financial losses to poultry producers. This study was performed with the objectives of estimating the seroprevalence and associated risk factors of IBD in backyard chickens in Wolaita zone, southern Ethiopia. METHODS: A total of 482 serum samples were collected from chickens reared under backyard systems using a multi-stage cross-sectional study design. The serum samples were tested for the presence of anti-IBDV antibodies using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A questionnaire survey was also performed to identify risk factors affecting chicken production in the study area. RESULTS: From the total of 482 serum samples tested, 236 (48.96%; 95% CI: 44.32-53.42) were positive for anti-IBDV antibodies. Higher seroprevalence was recorded in Humbo district (55.75%; 95% CI: 46.11-65.09) followed by Sodo Zuria (51.54%; 95% CI: 42.62-60.39), Damotgale (46.22%; 95% CI: 36.49-56.18), and Kindokoysha district (42.86%; 95% CI: 34.32-51.72) although the difference was not statistically significant. Significantly lower prevalence was recorded in indigenous chickens (43.36%; 95% CI: 37.53-49.32) compared to exotic chickens (57.14%; 95% CI: 49.89-64.17). The odds of occurrence of IBD in the local chicken breed was 0.67 times lower than that of the exotic chicken breed. The odds of occurrence of IBD in chickens from flock size ≥5 chickens was 4.33 times higher than chickens from flock size <5 chickens. A statistically significant association (P < 0.05) was observed between treatment history and isolation of sick chickens with mortality in the flock. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that IBD is one of the major infectious diseases  that affect the traditionally managed chickens in the study area with the flock size and breed of chickens are identified as important risk factors for IBD occurrence. Besides, chicken producers did not have enough knowledge about the nature and epidemiology of IBD. Thus, proper management practices together with appropriate vaccination programs are necessary to reduce IBD incidence in the study areas.	0
35179843	Risk factors for outbreaks caused by variant strain of Newcastle disease on environmentally controlled broiler chicken farms in Lahore, Pakistan.	Newcastle disease (ND) is a frequently reported disease in poultry among both vaccinated and non-vaccinated flocks in Pakistan. During 2011-2012 poultry industry in Punjab, mainly in Lahore region, faced fatal outbreaks of ND caused by a variant strain. An analytical study was conducted during outbreak period in  Lahore region. A total of 114 environmentally controlled farms were selected with the help of convenient sampling method. A questionnaire was designed about the potential risk factors associated with the spread of ND outbreak. The bivariate relationships between ND status and independent variables were investigated by applying the Chi-square and Fisher's exact test. Multivariable logistic model was used to estimate the effect of each studied variable on the outcome by adjusting  the other variables in the model. The variables which showed an association with  ND outbreaks at commercial poultry farms were improper method for dead birds disposal (OR=4.96; 95% CI 1.63-15.12), use of same feed transporting vehicle at multiple poultry farms (OR=4.92; 95% CI 1.58-15.33), farm to farm distance of less than 1 km (OR=9.32; 95% CI(1.19-73.12), number of sheds at one farm (OR=2.31; 95% CI 0.93-5.69), labor type (OR=2.72; 95% CI 0.83-8.88) and biosecurity (OR= 4.47; 95% CI 0.56-35.66).	0
34710471	Transcriptional regulation of CYP19A1 expression in chickens: ESR1, ESR2 and NR5A2 form a functional network.	Aromatase, encoded by CYP19A1, is responsible for the conversion of androgen to estrogen, which plays a vital role in the development and function of the ovary and functions in many other physiological processes in both sexes. Instead of being expressed in ovarian granulosa cells, as in mammals, CYP19A1 is expressed in chickens in the theca cells of ovarian follicles, and the mechanism of CYP19A1 expression regulation remains unknown. Here, using immunofluorescence and western blotting assay, we first confirmed that CYP19A1 and FOXL2 (Forkheadbox L2) were coexpressed in pre-granulosa cells of female chicken embryonic gonads, while FOXL2 did not affect aromatase expression at embryonic stages. Second, our research showed that CYP19A1, ESR1 (estrogen receptor alpha), ESR2 (estrogen receptor beta) and NR5A2 (liver receptor homologue-1) were coexpressed in the theca cell layers of chicken small yellow follicles. There was cross-talk between CYP19A1 and candidate transcription factors (ESR1, ESR2 and NR5A2), which was identified by generating a reliable theca cell culture model. Using luciferase assays in theca cells and chicken embryonic fibroblast (DF-1) cells, the results  suggested that ESR1 and NR5A2 had potential effects on CYP19A1 promoter activity  in chickens. Overexpression of ESR1, ESR2 and NR5A2 in chicken embryonic fibroblast (DF-1) cells upregulated the protein expression of CYP19A1, mutually restricted each other and formed a potential regulatory network to coordinate the expression of CYP19A1. To conclude, our results indicated that FOXL2 cannot regulate the expression of CYP19A1 at chicken embryonic stages and after sexual maturity, ESR1, ESR2 and NR5A2 form a functional network to affect the expression of CYP19A1. These results laid a foundation for further research on the transcriptional regulation of chicken aromatase.	0
34573320	Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis Reveals Marker Genes and Potential Therapeutic Targets for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.	Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare cardiovascular disease with very  high mortality rate. The currently available therapeutic strategies, which improve symptoms, cannot fundamentally reverse the condition. Thus, new therapeutic strategies need to be established. Our research analyzed three microarray datasets of lung tissues from human PAH samples retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. We combined two datasets for subsequent analyses, with the batch effects removed. In the merged dataset, 542 DEGs were identified and the key module relevant to PAH was selected using WGCNA. GO and KEGG analyses of DEGs and the key module indicated that the pre-ribosome, ribosome biogenesis, centriole, ATPase activity, helicase activity, hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy, melanoma, and dilated cardiomyopathy pathways are involved in PAH. With the filtering standard (|MM| > 0.95 and |GS| > 0.90), 70 hub genes were identified. Subsequently, five candidate marker genes (CDC5L, AP3B1, ZFYVE16, DDX46, and PHAX) in the key module were found through overlapping with the top thirty genes calculated by two different methods in CytoHubb. Two of them (CDC5L  and DDX46) were found to be significantly upregulated both in the merged dataset  and the validating dataset in PAH patients. Meanwhile, expression of the selected genes in lung from PAH chicken measured by qRT-PCR and the ROC curve analyses further verified the potential marker genes' predictive value for PAH. In conclusion, CDC5L and DDX46 may be marker genes and potential therapeutic targets for PAH.	0
35056618	Dietary Beta-Hydroxy-Beta-Methyl Butyrate Supplementation Inhibits Hepatic Fat Deposition via Regulating Gut Microbiota in Broiler Chickens.	The present study is aimed to explore the effects of different dietary beta-hydroxy-beta-methyl butyrate (HMB) levels (0, 0.05%, 0.10%, or 0.15%) on liver lipid metabolism on Wenshi broiler chickens. Results showed that HMB reduced the liver weight as well as liver concentrations of triacylglycerol (TG)  and total cholesterol (TC) (quadratically, p < 0.05), and the lowest values were  observed in the 0.10% HMB group. Meanwhile, HMB supplementation significantly altered the expression levels of key genes related to lipid metabolism in the liver of broiler chickens (p < 0.05). Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that HMB supplementation could greatly change the richness, diversity, and composition of the broiler gut microbiota, and the Bacteroidetes relative abundance at the phylum level and the Alistipes relative abundance at the genus level were affected (p < 0.05). Correlation analysis further suggested a strong association between Bacteroidetes relative abundance and lipid metabolism-related parameters (p < 0.05). Together, these data suggest that 0.10% HMB supplementation could inhibit hepatic fat deposition via regulating gut microbiota in broilers.	0
34739966	Comparative susceptibility of the common teal (Anas crecca) to infection with high pathogenic avian influenza virus strains isolated in Japan in 2004-2017.	High pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) of the H5 subtype have spread in poultry and wild birds worldwide. Current studies have highlighted the association between the migration of wild birds and the spread of HPAIVs. However, virological studies examining responsible species of migratory birds to  spread HPAIVs are limited. In Japan, the common teal (Anas crecca) arrives in great numbers for overwintering every autumn-spring season; therefore, we performed experimental infection using six H5 HPAIVs isolated in past outbreaks in Japan (A/chicken/Yamaguchi/7/2004 (H5N1), A/whooper swan/Akita/1/2008 (H5N1),  A/mandarin duck/Miyazaki/22M-765/2011 (H5N1), A/duck/Chiba/26-372-48/2014 (H5N8), A/duck/Hyogo/1/2016 (H5N6) and A/mute swan/Shimane/3211A002/2017 (H5N6)) to evaluate the susceptibility of the species to HPAIV infection. The results illustrated that most birds in all experimental groups were infected by the strains, and they shed viruses for a prolonged period, in trachea than cloaca, without displaying distinctive clinical signs. In addition, comparative analysis  using calculation value of total viral shedding during the experiment revealed that the birds shed viruses at above a certain level regardless of the differences of strains. These results suggested that the common teal could be a migratory bird species that disseminates viruses in the environment, thereby influencing HPAI outbreaks in wild birds in Japan.	0
35371568	Dietary Patterns and Their Association with Metabolic Syndrome and Their Components in Middle-Class Adults from Damascus, Syria: A Cross-Sectional Study.	Prior to the 2016 crisis in Syria, a study conducted in Aleppo found the prevalence of metabolic syndrome to be 39.6%, which is known to be favoured by age and poor lifestyle (including physical inactivity and the consumption of hypercaloric foods, rich in saturated fats, concentrated carbohydrates, and salt), so the objective of this study was to identify the association of different dietary patterns with metabolic syndrome and their components. A cross-sectional analytical study was carried out in 104 adults aged 40 to 65 years who did not suffer from previous diseases. The sample was chosen from middle-class citizens of the city of Damascus who were contacted by telephone; they were explained about the study, the information that would be collected, and the studies that should be carried out in the clinical analysis laboratory of the Private University of Syria. A nutritional and food study was carried out using previously validated forms containing 62 items in which the food intake of the participants was studied. We apply principal component analysis and factor analysis to detect nutritional components and dietary patterns. Dietary pattern 3 (foods with simple carbohydrates and saturated fat) increased glucose levels, while dietary patterns 1 (high intake of calories, protein, and saturated fat) and 5 (fast food) increased serum triglyceride levels. In addition, pattern 1 (carbonated beverages, grains, chicken, and meat) was associated with elevated LDL cholesterol levels and the presence of the metabolic syndrome. The study findings suggest that the presence of metabolic syndrome and its components are associated with dietary patterns high in calories, protein, simple carbohydrates, and saturated fat.	0
35317755	Genetic diversity and signatures of selection for heat tolerance and immune response in Iranian native chickens.	BACKGROUND: Understanding how evolutionary forces relating to climate have shaped the patterns of genetic variation within and between species is a fundamental pursuit in biology. Iranian indigenous chickens have evolved genetic adaptations  to their local environmental conditions, such as hot and arid regions. In the present study, we provide a population genome landscape of genetic variations in  72 chickens representing nine Iranian indigenous ecotypes (Creeper, Isfahan, Lari, Marand, Mashhad, Naked neck, Sari, Shiraz and Yazd) and two commercial lines (White Leghorn and Arian). We further performed comparative population genomics to evaluate the genetic basis underlying variation in the adaptation to  hot climate and immune response in indigenous chicken ecotypes. To detect genomic signatures of adaptation, we applied nucleotide diversity (θπ) and FST statistical measurements, and further analyzed the results to find genomic regions under selection for hot adaptation and immune response-related traits. RESULTS: By generating whole-genome data, we assessed the relationship between the genetic diversity of indigenous chicken ecotypes and their genetic distances  to two different commercial lines. The results of genetic structure analysis revealed clustering of indigenous chickens in agreement with their geographic origin. Among all studied chicken groups, the highest level of linkage disequilibrium (LD) (~ 0.70) was observed in White Leghorn group at marker pairs  distance of 1 Kb. The results from admixture analysis demonstrated evidence of shared ancestry between Arian individuals and indigenous chickens, especially those from the north of the country. Our search for potential genomic regions under selection in indigenous chicken ecotypes revealed several immune response and heat shock protein-related genes, such as HSP70, HSPA9, HSPH1, HSP90AB1 and PLCB4 that have been previously unknown to be involved in environmental-adaptive  traits. In addition, we found some other candidate loci on different chromosomes  probably related with hot adaptation and immune response-related traits. CONCLUSIONS: The work provides crucial insights into the structural variation in  the genome of Iranian indigenous chicken ecotypes, which up to now has not been genetically investigated. Several genes were identified as candidates for drought, heat tolerance, immune response and other phenotypic traits. These candidate genes may be helpful targets for understanding of the molecular basis of adaptation to hot environmental climate and as such they should be used in chicken breeding programs to select more efficient breeds for desert climate.	0

34903938	Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the stn gene of Salmonella species isolated from different environmental sources at Lake Qarun protectorate: The role of migratory birds and public health importance.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Salmonella causes most foodborne bacterial illnesses worldwide. It is found in various hosts, including pets, farm animals, and wild animals, as well as the environment. This study aimed to examine the epidemiological relationship between Salmonella isolates from aquatic environments and those from other avian hosts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study examined 12 water samples, 210 aquatic animals,  and 45 migratory aquatic bird samples collected from the protected area of Lake Qarun in El-Fayoum Governorate, Egypt, during migration seasons from different waterfowl migration areas (from October 2018 to January 2019). In addition, 45 fecal samples from domestic chickens were collected from the same geographic location from poultry farms. Bacteriological examination and polymerase chain reaction assay of two virulence genes (i.e., invA and stn) were performed to isolate and identify Salmonella. RESULTS: Salmonella was isolated from 58.3% (7/12) of Lake Qarun water samples, 13.3% (6/45) of migratory waterfowl, 6.6% of (3/45) of chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus), and 4.3% (3/70) of fish and pooled brine shrimp. In migratory aquatic bird species that were sampled, Salmonella were isolated from 23.1% (3/13) of Eurasian coot (Fulica atra), 12.5%, (1/8) of green-winged teal (Anas cardolinesis), 10% (2/20) of northern shoveler (Spatula clypeata), and 0% (0/4) of mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos). In 35 Tilapia, Salmonella was isolated by (8.6%) 5.7% of external surfaces, 2.85% from the intestine, and 0% from the muscle. No Salmonella was isolated from the 175 brine shrimp samples. Phylogenetic analysis using the stn genes of Salmonella isolated from the aquatic environment, migratory aquatic birds, and chicken showed a strong association between these isolates. In addition, a higher nucleotide identity percentage was  observed between the sequences recovered from migratory aquatic birds and Lake Qarun water samples. CONCLUSION: Salmonella distribution was confirmed through migratory aquatic birds, based on our phylogeny tree analysis, Salmonella considered a likely carrier of zoonotic bacterial pathogens. Furthermore, the close relationship between chicken and fish sequences highlights the scenarios of using chicken manure in fish farms and its public health implications. The presence of Salmonella in different environmental sources spotlights the urgent need to control and break down its epidemiological cycle.	0
35102184	gga-miRNOME, a microRNA-sequencing dataset from chick embryonic tissues.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules, with sizes ranging from 18 to 25 nucleotides, which are key players in gene expression regulation. These molecules play an important role in fine-tuning early vertebrate embryo development. However, there are scarce publicly available miRNA datasets from non-mammal embryos, such as the chicken (Gallus gallus), which is a classical model system to study vertebrate embryogenesis. Here, we performed microRNA-sequencing to characterize the early stages of trunk and limb development in the chick embryo. For this, we profiled three chick embryonic tissues, namely, Undetermined Presomitic Mesoderm (PSM_U), Determined Presomitic  Mesoderm (PSM_D) and Forelimb Distal Cyclic Domain (DCD). We identified 926 known miRNAs, and 1,141 novel candidate miRNAs, which nearly duplicates the number of Gallus gallus entries in the miRBase database. These data will greatly benefit the avian research community, particularly by highlighting new miRNAs potentially involved in the regulation of early vertebrate embryo development, that can be prioritized for further experimental testing.	0
34872001	Genome-wide survey and functional analysis reveal TCF21 promotes chicken preadipocyte differentiation by directly upregulating HTR2A.	BACKGROUND/AIM: Previously, we showed that transcription factor 21 (TCF21) promotes chicken preadipocyte differentiation. However, the genome-wide TCF21 binding sites and its downstream target genes in chicken adipogenesis were unknown. METHODS: ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq were used to screen candidate targets of TCF21. qPCR and luciferase reporter assay were applied to verify the sequencing results. Western blotting, oil red-O staining and pharmacological treatments were performed to investigate the function of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (HTR2A), one of the bonafide direct downstream binding targets of TCF21. RESULTS: A total of 94 candidate target genes of TCF21 were identified. ChIP-qPCR, RT-qPCR, and luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that HTR2A is one  of the bonafide direct downstream binding targets of TCF21. HTR2A expression in adipose tissue was upregulated in fat line broilers. Also, the abundance of HTR2A gradually increased during the adipogenesis process. Interestingly, pharmacological enhancement or inhibition of HTR2A promoted or attenuated the differentiation of preadipocytes, respectively. Furthermore, HTR2A inhibition impaired the TCF21 promoted adipogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: We profiled the genome-wide TCF21 binding sites in chicken differentiated preadipocytes revealing HTR2A as the direct downstream target of TCF21 in adipogenesis.	0
34574166	Real-Time Gauging of the Gelling Maturity of Duck Eggs Pickled in Strong Alkaline Solutions.	Although many ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared transmission spectroscopy techniques have been applied to chicken egg studies, such techniques are not suitable for duck eggs because duck eggshells are much thicker than chicken eggshells. In this study, a high-transmission spectrometer using an equilateral prism as a dispersive element and a flash lamp as a light source was constructed  to nondestructively detect the transmission spectrum of duck eggs and monitor the pickling of eggs. The evolution of egg transmittance was highly correlated with the albumen during pickling. The transmittance exponentially decays with time during this period, and the decay rate is related to the pickling rate. The colors of the albumen and yolk remain almost unchanged in the first stage. A multiple linear regression analysis model that realizes a one-to-one association  between the days of pickling and the transmission spectra was constructed to determine the pickling duration in the second stage. The coefficient of determination reached 0.88 for a single variable, wavelength, at 590 nm. This method can monitor the maturity of pickled eggs in real time and does not require the evolution of light transmittance.	0
35459547	α-Gal present on both glycolipids and glycoproteins contributes to immune response in meat-allergic patients.	BACKGROUND: The α-Gal syndrome is associated with the presence of IgE directed to the carbohydrate galactose-α-1,3-galactose (α-Gal) and is characterized by a delayed allergic reaction occurring 2 to 6 hours after ingestion of mammalian meat. On the basis of their slow digestion and processing kinetics, α-Gal-carrying glycolipids have been proposed as the main trigger of the delayed  reaction. OBJECTIVE: We analyzed and compared the in vitro allergenicity of α-Gal-carrying  glycoproteins and glycolipids from natural food sources. METHODS: Proteins and lipids were extracted from pork kidney (PK), beef, and chicken. Glycolipids were purified from rabbit erythrocytes. The presence of α-Gal and IgE binding of α-Gal-allergic patient sera (n = 39) was assessed by thin-layer chromatography as well as by direct and inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The in vitro allergenicity of glycoproteins and glycolipids  from different meat extracts was determined by basophil activation test. Glycoprotein stability was evaluated by simulated gastric and intestinal digestion assays. RESULTS: α-Gal was detected on glycolipids of PK and beef. Patient IgE antibodies recognized α-Gal bound to glycoproteins and glycolipids, although binding to glycoproteins was more potent. Rabbit glycolipids were able to strongly activate  patient basophils, whereas lipid extracts from PK and beef were also found to trigger basophil activation, but at a lower capacity compared to the respective protein extracts. Simulated gastric digestion assays of PK showed a high stability of α-Gal-carrying proteins in PK. CONCLUSION: Both α-Gal-carrying glycoproteins and glycolipids are able to strongly activate patient basophils. In PK and beef, α-Gal epitopes seem to be less abundant on glycolipids than on glycoproteins, suggesting a major role of glycoproteins in delayed anaphylaxis upon consumption of these food sources.	0
35453465	Creeping Wood Sorrel and Chromium Picolinate Effect on the Nutritional Composition and Lipid Oxidative Stability of Broiler Meat.	The study investigates the efficacy of Cr in broilers, aiming to evaluate the effects of Chromium picolinate (CrPic) in association with creeping wood sorrel powder (CWS) on the proximate composition, fatty acids profile, bioactive nutrients and lipid oxidative stability of broiler meat. A total of 120 Cobb 500  chickens were assigned into three treatments: a control diet (C) and two test diets, including 200 µg/kg diet CrPic (E1), and 200 µg/kg diet CrPic +10 g CWS/kg diet (E2). Dietary supplementation with Cr + CWS significantly improved the concentration of n - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), while its n - 6/n - 3 ratio decreased in comparison to the group receiving Cr and the conventional diet. The concentration of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) significantly increased in  the breast meat collected from the E2 group than that from the C group. Dietary administration of Cr and CWS improved lutein and zeaxanthin content, decreased Fe and Zn levels of the breast, and increased Zn deposition in the thigh samples. Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration decreased more in the thigh meat of the supplemental groups (E1, E2) than in that from the C group. In conclusion, the current study suggests that Cr together with CWS can be a viable option as antioxidant sources for broiler diets, promoting the nutritional quality of meat.	0

34800768	Genomic analysis of antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus spp. reveals novel enterococci strains and the spread of plasmid-borne Tet(M), Tet(L) and Erm(B) genes from chicken litter to agricultural soil in South Africa.	Manure from food animals exposed to antibiotics is often used as soil fertiliser, potentially releasing antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) with diverse antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) into the soil. To determine the impact of chicken litter application on the soil resistome, Enterococcus spp. isolated from chicken litter and soil samples collected before and after the soil amendment were characterised, using whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatics tools. Nineteen Enterococcus spp. isolates from the three sources were sequenced on Illumina Miseq platform to ascertain the isolates' resistome, mobilome, virulome, clonality, and phylogenomic relationships. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis revealed eight novel sequence types (STs) (ST1700, ST1752, ST1753, ST1754, ST1755, ST1756, ST1004, and ST1006). The isolates harboured multiple resistance genes including those conferring resistance to inter alia macrolides-lincosamide-streptogramin (erm(B), lnu(B), lnu(G), lsaA, lsaE, eat(A), msr(C)), tetracycline (tet(M), tet(L), tet(S)), aminoglycosides (aac(6')-Ii, aac(6')-Iih, ant(6)-Ia, aph(3')-III, ant(9)-Ia), fluoroquinolones (efmA, and emeA), vancomycin (VanC {VanC-2, VanXY, VanXYC-3, VanXYC-4, VanRC}), and chloramphenicol (cat). The litter-amended soil harboured new ARB (particularly E. faecium) and ARGs (ant(6)-Ia, aac(6')-Ii, aph(3')-III), lnu(G), msr(C), and eat(A), efmA) that were not previously detected in the soil. The identified ARGs  were associated with diverse mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such as insertion sequences (IS6, ISL3, IS256, IS30), transposons (Tn3 and Tn916) and plasmids (repUS43, repUS1, rep9b, and rep 22). Twenty-eight virulence genes encoding adherence/biofilm formation (ebpA, ebpB, ebpC), antiphagocytosis (elrA) and bacterial sex pheromones (Ccf10, cOB1, cad, and camE), were detected in the genomes of the isolates. Phylogenomic analysis revealed a close relationship between a few isolates from litter-amended soil and the chicken litter isolates.  The differences in the ARG and ARB profiles in the soil before and after the litter amendment and their association with diverse MGEs indicate the mobilisation and transmission of ARGs and ARB from the litter to the soil.	0
34495702	Endogenous Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) siRNA Transcription May Interfere with Exogenous FeLV Infection.	Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are increasingly recognized for biological impacts on host cell function and susceptibility to infectious agents, particularly in relation to interactions with exogenous retroviral progenitors (XRVs). ERVs can simultaneously promote and restrict XRV infections using mechanisms that are virus and host specific. The majority of endogenous-exogenous retroviral interactions have been evaluated in experimental mouse or chicken systems, which  are limited in their ability to extend findings to naturally infected outbred animals. Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) has a relatively well-characterized endogenous retrovirus with a coexisting virulent exogenous counterpart and is endemic worldwide in domestic cats. We have previously documented an association  between endogenous FeLV (enFeLV) long terminal repeat (LTR) copy number and abrogated exogenous FeLV in naturally infected cats and experimental infections in tissue culture. Analyses described here examine limited FeLV replication in experimentally infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which correlates with higher enFeLV transcripts in these cells compared to fibroblasts. We further examine NCBI Sequence Read Archive RNA transcripts to evaluate enFeLV transcripts and RNA interference (RNAi) precursors. We find that lymphoid-derived tissues, which are experimentally less permissive to exogenous FeLV infection, transcribe  higher levels of enFeLV under basal conditions. Transcription of enFeLV-LTR segments is significantly greater than that of other enFeLV genes. We documented  transcription of a 21-nucleotide (nt) microRNA (miRNA) just 3' to the enFeLV 5'-LTR in the feline miRNAome of all data sets evaluated (n = 27). Our findings point to important biological functions of enFeLV transcription linked to solo LTRs distributed within the domestic cat genome, with potential impacts on domestic cat exogenous FeLV susceptibility and pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are increasingly implicated in host cellular processes and susceptibility to infectious agents, specifically regarding interactions with exogenous retroviral progenitors (XRVs). Exogenous feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and its endogenous counterpart (enFeLV) represent a well-characterized, naturally occurring XRV-ERV dyad. We have previously documented an abrogated FeLV infection in both naturally infected cats and experimental fibroblast infections that harbor higher enFeLV proviral loads. Using an in silico approach, we provide evidence of miRNA transcription that is produced in tissues that are most important for FeLV infection, replication, and  transmission. Our findings point to important biological functions of enFeLV transcription linked to solo-LTRs distributed within the feline genome, with potential impacts on domestic cat exogenous FeLV susceptibility and pathogenesis. This body of work provides additional evidence of RNA interference (RNAi) as a mechanism of viral interference and is a demonstration of ERV exaptation by the host to defend against related XRVs.	0
35327970	Liver Transcriptome Response to Heat Stress in Beijing You Chickens and Guang Ming Broilers.	Heat stress is one of the most prevalent issues in poultry production that reduces performance, robustness, and economic gains. Previous studies have demonstrated that native chickens are more tolerant of heat than commercial breeds. However, the underlying mechanisms of the heat tolerance observed in native chicken breeds remain unelucidated. Therefore, we performed a phenotypical, physiological, liver transcriptome comparative analysis and WGCNA in response to heat stress in one native (Beijing You, BY) and one commercial (Guang Ming, GM) chicken breed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the heat tolerance and identify the potential driver and hub genes related to heat stress in these two genetically distinct chicken breeds. In brief, 80 BY and 60 GM, 21 days old chickens were submitted to a heat stress experiment for 5 days (33 °C, 8 h/day). Each breed was divided into experimental groups of control (Ctl) and heat stress (HS). The results showed that BY chickens were less affected by heat stress and displayed reduced DEGs than GM chickens, 365 DEGs and 382 DEGs, respectively. The transcriptome analysis showed that BY chickens exhibited enriched pathways related to metabolism activity, meanwhile GM chickens' pathways were related to inflammatory reactions. CPT1A and ANGPTL4 for  BY chickens, and HSP90B1 and HSPA5 for GM chickens were identified as potential candidate genes associated with HS. The WGCNA revealed TLR7, AR, BAG3 genes as hub genes, which could play an important role in HS. The results generated in this study provide valuable resources for studying liver transcriptome in response to heat stress in native and commercial chicken lines.	0
35008049	Household Bird Ownership is Associated with Respiratory Illness among Young Children in Urban Bangladesh (CHoBI7 Program).	There is limited evidence on the association between animal ownership and respiratory illness among young children in low- and middle-income countries. In  this study, we examined the association between animal ownership and respiratory  illness among children younger than 5 years of age enrolled in a prospective cohort study in urban Bangladesh. This prospective cohort study enrolled 884 participants younger than 5 years of age in Dhaka, Bangladesh. At baseline, trained research assistants administered caregivers of children younger than 5 years of age a questionnaire on household animal ownership. Animal ownership was  defined as owning chickens, birds other than chickens, cats, and dogs. Respiratory surveillance was conducted monthly for children based on caregiver-reported coughing, rapid breathing, and difficulty breathing in the past 2 weeks during the 12-month study period. At baseline, 48% of children (424  of 884) had reports of coughing, 5% (40 of 884) had difficulty breathing, 3% (25  of 884) had rapid breathing, and 49% (431 of 884) had reports of any of these three respiratory symptoms. Seventeen percent of children (151 of 884) resided in a household that owned an animal. Children residing in households reporting bird  ownership had a significantly greater odds of coughing (odds ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.02-1.28) and any of the three respiratory symptoms in the past 2 weeks (odds ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.02-1.28). Household bird ownership was associated with respiratory illness in young children. These findings suggest that interventions  aiming to reduce young children's exposure to domestic animals should extend to include birds other than chickens.	0
35100292	Comparison of seven SNP calling pipelines for the next-generation sequencing data of chickens.	Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are widely used in genome-wide association studies and population genetics analyses. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become convenient, and many SNP-calling pipelines have been developed for human NGS data. We took advantage of a gap knowledge in selecting the appropriated SNP  calling pipeline to handle with high-throughput NGS data. To fill this gap, we studied and compared seven SNP calling pipelines, which include 16GT, genome analysis toolkit (GATK), Bcftools-single (Bcftools single sample mode), Bcftools-multiple (Bcftools multiple sample mode), VarScan2-single (VarScan2 single sample mode), VarScan2-multiple (VarScan2 multiple sample mode) and Freebayes pipelines, using 96 NGS data with the different depth gradients of approximately 5X, 10X, 20X, 30X, 40X, and 50X coverage from 16 Rhode Island Red chickens. The sixteen chickens were also genotyped with a 50K SNP array, and the  sensitivity and specificity of each pipeline were assessed by comparison to the results of SNP arrays. For each pipeline, except Freebayes, the number of detected SNPs increased as the input read depth increased. In comparison with other pipelines, 16GT, followed by Bcftools-multiple, obtained the most SNPs when the input coverage exceeded 10X, and Bcftools-multiple obtained the most when the input was 5X and 10X. The sensitivity and specificity of each pipeline increased  with increasing input. Bcftools-multiple had the highest sensitivity numerically  when the input ranged from 5X to 30X, and 16GT showed the highest sensitivity when the input was 40X and 50X. Bcftools-multiple also had the highest specificity, followed by GATK, at almost all input levels. For most calling pipelines, there were no obvious changes in SNP numbers, sensitivities or specificities beyond 20X. In conclusion, (1) if only SNPs were detected, the sequencing depth did not need to exceed 20X; (2) the Bcftools-multiple may be the best choice for detecting SNPs from chicken NGS data, but for a single sample or  sequencing depth greater than 20X, 16GT was recommended. Our findings provide a reference for researchers to select suitable pipelines to obtain SNPs from the NGS data of chickens or nonhuman animals.	0
35393054	Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes related to oxidative stress and ion channels in chickens are associated with semen quality and hormonal responses to  thermal stress.	Heat stress causes economic loss of livestock industry in tropical areas. Exploring genetic markers for selection of thermotolerance will benefit chicken production. Oxidative stress and fluid-salt balance are tightly associated with thermotolerance and productivity in domestic animals. The study aimed to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to oxidative stress and ion-channel regulation and their associations with semen quality and hormonal responses. In total, 28 SNPs within 11 candidate genes were identified to associate with hormonal changes and semen quality in both broiler- and layer-type Taiwan country chickens (TCCs) after exposure to acute heat stress at 38 °C for 4 h. Acute heat stress significantly affected plasma levels of triiodothyronine and corticosterone and reduced sperm motility, viability, and concentrations in both strains at Day 1 after exposure. In the B-strain TCCs, five SNPs within NDUFA8 and DAB2IP had significant effects on plasma adrenaline and corticosterone levels, and six SNPs within TRPC1, SLC9A9, and TRPC7 markedly affected plasma corticosterone and triiodothyronine levels. In the L2 strain, 15 SNPs within PSMA2, TPK1, MTF1, and CUL1 exerted effects on plasma corticosterone and triiodothyronine levels. Five SNPs within CUL3, TRPC1, and SLC9A9 in the B strain and two SNPs within MTF1 in the L2 strain were associated with sperm concentrations at Day 1 after exposure to heat stress. In conclusion, acute heat  stress impaired semen quality and altered plasma corticosterone and triiodothyronine levels in TCCs. Some SNPs involved in oxidative stress and ion-channel regulation were identified to associate with the hormonal and semen alterations. These SNPs in conjunction with differential hormonal responses and semen quality serve as genetic markers for thermotolerance selection in sire lines of chickens.	0
34573400	Genetic Diversity of Microneme Protein 2 and Surface Antigen 1 of Eimeria tenella.	Avian coccidiosis is a disease caused by members of the genus Eimeria. Huge economic losses incurred by the global poultry industry due to coccidiosis have increased the need for cost-effective and easily available recombinant vaccines.  Microneme protein 2 (MIC2) and surface antigen 1 (SAG1) of E. tenella have been recognised as potential vaccine candidates. However, the genetic diversity of the antigens in field isolates, which affects vaccine efficacy, has yet to be largely investigated. Here, we analysed genetic diversity and natural selection of etmic2 and etsag1 in Korean E. tenella isolates. Both genes exhibited low levels of genetic diversity in Korean isolates. However, the two genes showed different patterns of nucleotide diversity and amino acid polymorphism involving the E. tenella isolates obtained from different countries including China and India. These results underscore the need to investigate the genetic diversity of the vaccine candidate antigens and warrant monitoring of genetic heterogeneity and evolutionary aspects of the genes in larger numbers of E. tenella field isolates  from different geographical areas to design effective coccidial vaccines.	0
34700098	A comparative study of libido in drakes: from phenotypes to molecules.	Low fertilization rate is the main reason to limit the development of artificial  insemination (AI) technology in ducks. However, the libido of male livestock has  been confirmed to be related to semen quality and fertilization rate, and we found that the libido of drakes was different. Thus, the research on the libido of drakes may be the key to further develop and apply AI technology. In this research, we established the first scoring standard for libido evaluation in drakes based on the performance of drakes during training period. Phenotypically, the body weight of high libido group was lighter than that of the other groups, while the weight of testis and epididymis in the high libido group was higher than that in the low libido group. Furthermore, we constructed the first expression profile of hypothalamus, pituitary, testis, and epididymis of drakes with high or low libido. There were 2, 1822, 214, and 892 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in hypothalamus, pituitary, testis, and epididymis. The expression and sequence of Translocation Associated Membrane Protein 2 (TRAM2) were different in high and low libido drakes, indicating that it may be a candidate gene related to drake's libido. The estrogen, prolactin, and oxytocin signaling pathways were all activated in the pituitary of the low libido group. Meanwhile, the metabolic and oxidative phosphorylation pathways were enriched by  DEGs in pituitary, testis and epididymis. Our research reveals that the difference in metabolic may cause changes in body weight of drakes, resulting in  altered hormone levels and oxidative phosphorylation of gonad, which negatively affects libido and spermatogenesis in drakes. These results provide novel insights into the avian libido and will help better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms.	0
34912840	Dietary Enteromorpha Polysaccharide Enhances Intestinal Immune Response, Integrity, and Caecal Microbial Activity of Broiler Chickens.	Marine algae polysaccharides have been shown to regulate various biological activities, such as immune modulation, antioxidant, antidiabetic, and hypolipidemic. However, litter is known about the interaction of these polysaccharides with the gut microbiota. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of marine algae Enteromorpha (Ulva) prolifera polysaccharide (EP) supplementation on growth performance, immune response, and caecal microbiota of broiler chickens. A total of 200 1-day-old Ross-308 broiler chickens were randomly divided into two treatment groups with ten replications of ten chickens in each replication. The dietary treatments consisted of the control group (fed basal diet), and EP group (received diet supplemented with 400 mg EP/kg diet). Results  showed that chickens fed EP exhibited significantly higher (P < 0.05) body weight and average daily gain than the chicken-fed basal diet. In addition, significantly longer villus height, shorter crypt depth, and higher villus height to crypt depth ratio were observed in the jejunal and ileal tissues of chickens fed EP. EP supplementation upregulated the mRNA expression of NF-κB, TLR4, MyD88, IL-2, IFN-α, and IL-1β in the ileal and jejunal tissues (P < 0.05). Besides, we observed significantly higher (P < 0.05) short-chain volatile fatty acids (SCFAs) levels in the caecal contents of the EP group than in the control group. Furthermore, 16S-rRNA analysis revealed that EP supplementation altered gut microbiota and caused an abundance shift at the phylum and genus level in broiler chicken. Interestingly, we observed an association between microbiota and SCFAs production. Overall, this study demonstrated that supplementation of diet with EP promotes growth performance, improves intestinal immune response and integrity, and modulates the caecal microbiota of broiler chickens. This study highlighted the application of marine algae polysaccharides as an antibiotic alternative for  chickens. Furthermore, it provides insight to develop marine algae polysaccharide-based functional food and therapeutic agent.	0
35365230	Biogeography, succession, and origin of the chicken intestinal mycobiome.	BACKGROUND: Extensive work has been accomplished to characterize the intestinal bacterial community, known as the microbiota, and its association with host health and disease. However, very little is known about the spatiotemporal development and the origin of a minor intestinal fungal community, known as the mycobiota, in humans and animals, particularly in avian species. RESULTS: In this study, we comprehensively characterized the biogeography and succession of the gastrointestinal (GI) mycobiota of broiler chickens and further revealed the fungal sources that are responsible for initial and long-term establishment of the mycobiota in the GI tract. Using Illumina sequencing of the  internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region of fungal rRNA genes, we detected significant spatial and temporal differences in the mycobiota along the GI tract. In contrary to the microbiota, the mycobiota was more diverse in the upper than the lower GI tract with no apparent trend of succession up to 42 days of age. The intestinal mycobiota was dominated by the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota with Gibberella, Aspergillus, and Candida being the most abundant genera. Although the chicken mycobiota was highly dynamic, Fusarium pseudonygamai was dominant throughout the GI tract regardless of age in this study. The core chicken mycobiome consisted of 26 fungal taxa accounting for greater than 85% of the fungal population in each GI location. However, we observed high variations of the intestinal mycobiota among different studies. We also showed that the total fungal population varied greatly from 1.0 × 104 to 1.1 × 106 /g digesta along the GI tract and only accounted for less than 0.06% of the bacteria in day-42 broilers. Finally, we revealed that the mycobiota from the hatchery environment was responsible for initial colonization in the GI tract of newly hatched chickens, but was quickly replaced by the fungi in the diet within 3 days. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to the intestinal microbiota that consists of trillions of  bacteria in hundreds of different species and becomes relatively stabilized as animals age, the chicken intestinal mycobiota is a minor microbial community that is temporally dynamic with limited diversity and no obvious pattern of successive changes. However, similar to the microbiota, the chicken mycobiota is spatially different along the GI tract, although it is more diverse in the upper than the lower GI tract. Dietary fungi are the major source of the intestinal mycobiota in growing chickens. Video abstract.	0
34859725	The association of ribosomal protein L18 with Newcastle disease virus matrix protein enhances viral translation and replication.	Numerous studies have shown that viruses can utilize or manipulate ribosomal proteins to achieve viral protein biosynthesis and replication. In our recent studies using proteomics analysis of virus-infected cells, we found that ribosomal protein L18 (RPL18) was the highest up-regulated differentially expressed protein, along with the increasingly expressed viral proteins later in  Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection. However, the association of RPL18 with viral protein biosynthesis and NDV replication remains unclear. In this study, we found that the expression and transcription levels of RPL18 was reduced early in  NDV infection but increased later in NDV infection. In addition, the presence of  cytoplasmic NDV matrix (M) protein was responsible for the increased expression of RPL18 in both virus-infected cells and plasmid-transfected cells. Moreover, cytoplasmic M protein increased RPL18 expression in a dose-dependent manner, even though they did not interact with each other. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of RPL18 or overexpression of RPL18 dramatically reduced or enhanced NDV replication by decreasing or increasing viral protein translation rather than viral RNA synthesis and transcription. Taken together, these results suggested that the increased expression of RPL18 might be associated with the physical clumping together of the M protein, which in turn promoted viral protein biosynthesis and NDV replication. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTSThe increased expression of  RPL18 is associated with the presence of cytoplasmic M protein.Cytoplasmic M protein increases RPL18 expression in a dose-dependent manner.Knockdown of RPL18  reduces NDV replication by decreasing viral protein translation.Overexpression of RPL18 enhances NDV replication by increasing viral protein translation.	0
35453746	Identification of Key Candidate Genes in Runs of Homozygosity of the Genome of Two Chicken Breeds, Associated with Cold Adaptation.	It is well known that the chicken gene pools have high adaptive abilities, including adaptation to cold environments. This research aimed to study the genomic distribution of runs of homozygosity (ROH) in a population of Russian White (RW) chickens as a result of selection for adaptation to cold environments  in the early postnatal period, to perform a structural annotation of the discovered breed-specific regions of the genome (compared to chickens of the Amroks breed) and to suggest key candidate genes associated with the adaptation of RW chickens to cold environments. Genotyping of individual samples was performed using Illumina Chicken 60K SNP BeadChip® chips. The search for homozygous regions by individual chromosomes was carried out using the PLINK 1.9  program and the detectRuns R package. Twelve key genes on breed-specific ROH islands were identified. They may be considered as potential candidate genes associated with the high adaptive ability of chickens in cold environments in the early postnatal period. Genes associated with lipid metabolism (SOCS3, NDUFA4, TXNRD2, IGFBP 1, IGFBP 3), maintaining body temperature in cold environments (ADIPOQ, GCGR, TRPM2), non-shivering thermogenesis (RYR2, CAMK2G, STK25) and muscle development (METTL21C) are perspectives for further research. This study contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms of adaptation to cold environments in chickens and provides a molecular basis for selection work.	0
35107364	FAdV-4 without Fiber-2 Is a Highly Attenuated and Protective Vaccine Candidate.	Hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome (HHS) caused by the highly pathogenic fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4) has resulted in huge economic losses to the poultry industry globally. The fiber-2 gene, as a major virulence determiner, is  also an important vaccine target against FAdV-4. In this study, we used a CRISPR/Cas9-based homology-dependent recombinant technique to replace the fiber-2 gene with egfp and generate a novel recombinant virus, designated FAdV4-EGFP-rF2. Although FAdV4-EGFP-rF2 showed low replication ability compared to the wild-type  FAdV-4 in LMH cells, FAdV4-EGFP-rF2 could effectively replicate in LMH-F2 cells with the expression of Fiber-2. Moreover, FAdV4-EGFP-rF2 was not only highly attenuated in chickens, but also could provide efficient protection against a lethal challenge of FAdV-4. Moreover, FAdV4-EGFP-rF2 without fiber-2 could induce neutralizing antibodies at the same level as FA4-EGFP with fiber-2. These results clearly demonstrate that although fiber-2 affects the viral replication and pathogenesis of FAdV-4, it is not necessary for virus replication and induction of neutralizing antibodies; these findings provide novel insights into the roles  of fiber-2 and highlight fiber-2 as an insertion site for generating live-attenuated FAdV-4 vaccines against FAdV-4 and other pathogens. IMPORTANCE Among all serotypes of fowl adenovirus, serotypes FAdV-1, FAdV-4, and FAdV-10 are unique members with two fiber genes (fiber-1 and fiber-2). Recent studies reveal  that Fiber-1, not Fiber-2, directly triggers viral infection of FAdV-4, whereas Fiber-2, but not Fiber-1, has been identified as the major virulence determiner and an efficient protective immunogen for subunit vaccines. Here, we replaced fiber-2 with egfp to generate a novel recombinant virus, designated FAdV4-EGFP-rF2. In vitro and in vivo studies on FAdV4-EGFP-rF2 revealed that fiber-2 was not necessary for either virus replication or efficient protection for FAdV-4; these results not only provide a novel live-attenuated vaccine candidate against HHS, but also give new ideas for generating a FAdV-4 based vaccine vector against other pathogens.	0
34872745	Centennial Review: Factors affecting the chicken gastrointestinal microbial composition and their association with gut health and productive performance.	"Maintenance of ""gut health"" is considered a priority in commercial chicken farms, although a precise definition of what constitutes gut health and how to evaluate  it is still lacking. In research settings, monitoring of gut microbiota has gained great attention as shifts in microbial community composition have been associated with gut health and productive performance. However, microbial signatures associated with productivity remain elusive because of the high variability of the microbiota of individual birds resulting in multiple and sometimes contradictory profiles associated with poor or high performance. The high costs associated with the testing and the need for the terminal sampling of  a large number of birds for the collection of gut contents also make this tool of limited use in commercial settings. This review highlights the existing literature on the chicken digestive system and associated microbiota; factors affecting the gut microbiota and emergence of the major chicken enteric diseases  coccidiosis and necrotic enteritis; methods to evaluate gut health and their association with performance; main issues in investigating chicken microbial populations; and the relationship of microbial profiles and production outcomes.  Emphasis is given to emerging noninvasive and easy-to-collect sampling methods that could be used to monitor gut health and microbiological changes in commercial flocks."	0
34534850	The association of social rank with paternity efficiency in competitive mating flocks of Zi goose ganders (Anser cygnoides L.).	"The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of social rank (SR) on paternity efficiency (PE) in competitive mating flocks of geese. Thirty ganders and 150 geese (Zi geese, Anser cygnoides L.) aged approximately one, were divided into 3 groups. Flock 1 included 10 ganders and 50 female geese, flock 2 included  11 ganders and 55 female geese, and flock 3 included 9 ganders and 45 female geese. The frequency of the agonistic behavioral interactions (ABI) of the ganders and mating activity (MA) were video recorded in each flock. The SR of each gander was determined by the frequency of ABI with a score of 1 to 3 (1 being the dominant and 3 the most subordinate). To clarify the difference between being dominant and submissive, we collapsed rank 2 and rank 3 into a ""subordinate"" category. In total, 280 eggs were collected, and 219 goslings were  hatched. Parent-offspring relationships among 399 individuals from the 2 generations were identified via 20 microsatellite markers, and the PE of each gander was calculated. There was no significant difference in individual body weight and semen quality factor among the different SR groups (dominant and subordinate), and the SR of the ganders was significantly correlated to PE for the 3 flocks. Goslings of high-ranking ganders contributed 48.68% in flock 1, 37.50% in flock 2, and 47.62% in flock 3. Approximately 45% of all goslings were  sired by the 7 dominant ganders of the 30 total ganders across the 3 flocks. As SR has been shown to be heritable in geese, the selection of high-ranking ganders might be an effective way to improve reproductive efficiency in commercial geese  flocks."	0
35164622	Polymorphism in the 5' regulatory region of CTNNB1 gene and association with age  at first lay and egg production.	1. The Wnt signalling pathway is centred on the fact that catenin beta-1(CTNNB1)  participates in the regulation of ovarian follicle development. The aim of the following study was to identify polymorphisms in the 5' regulatory region of the  chicken CTNNB1 gene and evaluate the association between SNPs and egg production  traits.2. The study demonstrated that the 5' regulatory region of the CTNNB1 gene has 10 SNPs in the investigated Jining Bairi chickens. After Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, five SNPs (rs315692306, 2:g43385123, rs735854102, 2:g43385457 and rs737907370) were significantly correlated with egg  laying traits.3. An association study of the haplotypes with egg laying traits revealed that both haplotypes in block 1 (consisting of rs735052881, rs740662190, rs315692306, and 2:43385123) and block 2 (consisting of rs735854102 and 2:g43385457) were associated with point of lay age and the number of eggs laid at 18-23 weeks. Prediction of transcription factor-binding sites showed that transcription factors changed after mutation in block 2. The luciferase assay revealed that the priming activity of the CA haplotype in block 2 was the highest.4. Taken together, the rs315692306, 2:g43385123, rs735854102, 2:g43385457 and rs737907370 in the 5' regulatory region of the CTNNB1 gene have significant impacts on egg production.	0
34659604	Assessment of the role played by domestic animals in jigger infection in Kandara  sub-county, Kenya (case control study).	INTRODUCTION: tungiasis is an ectoparasitosis caused by penetration of female sand flea, Tunga penetrans, into the skin of the susceptible animal and the consequent hypertrophy of the parasite. The objective of this study was to assess the association between domestic animals and jigger infection among the residents of Kandara sub-county in central Kenya. METHODS: this was a case-control study that involved 776 individuals. Half of this number entailed case group who were jigger infected while the other half was the control, composed of jigger free participants. Structured questionnaires were, administered among the heads of the households to which the participants belonged to gather information concerning the animals they kept. Univariate analysis was, applied. RESULTS: in this study, there were significant differences in age (P=0.008) between the two groups. Disparities in source of income (P<0.001) and level of education (P<0.001) came out as very significant factors in jigger infection. The case group was 10 times more likely to keep dogs than the control(9.6; 95% CI, 5.9-15.6). Case group was also 7 times more likely to rear chicken in comparison  to the control (6.6; 95%, 4.2-10.4). The case group was 12 times more likely to let dogs loose in the compound in comparison to the control (12.1: 95%, 5.9-24.5). When compared to the control, this group was also 17 times more likely to keep chicken inside their houses (16.7: 95% CI, 6.8-35.9). Conclusion: there is a very high association between domestic animals and occurrence of tungiasis in Kandara sub-county.	0
34965897	Of mice and chickens: Revisiting the RC time constant problem.	Avian hair cells depend on electrical resonance for frequency selectivity. The upper bound of the frequency range is limited by the RC time constant of hair cells because the sharpness of tuning requires that the resonance frequency must  be lower than the RC roll-off frequency. In contrast, tuned mechanical vibration  of the inner ear is the basis of frequency selectivity of the mammalian ear. This mechanical vibration is supported by outer hair cells (OHC) with their electromotility (or piezoelectricity), which is driven by the receptor potential. Thus, it is also subjected to the RC time constant problem. Association of OHCs with a system with mechanical resonance leads to piezoelectric resonance. This resonance can nullify the membrane capacitance and solves the RC time constant problem for OHCs. Therefore, avian and mammalian ears solve the same problem in the opposite way.	0
35281610	Seroprevalence of Infectious Bronchitis Virus in Broiler and Layer Farms of Central Ethiopia.	Background: Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a highly contagious viral disease of chicken typically affecting the reproductive and respiratory tract and results in possible economic causes from its serious infectious and transmission  characteristics. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried on serum samples of chickens selected from six (two commercial and four small holder) farms and two types of production (broiler and layer) to detect seroprevalence of IBV and its associated risk factors in Bishoftu and Holeta areas of central Ethiopia from June 2021 to September 2021. A total of 354 blood samples were collected and subjected to indirect ELISA test by IBV antibody test kit ((ProFLOK IBV), from ProFLOK Laboratories Inc., (USA)) to detect specific antibodies against IBV. Results: Overall, 97.46% seroprevalence was identified. From 230 and 124 samples  collected from commercial and smallholder poultry farms, 226 (98.26%) and 119 (95.98%) positive results were obtained, respectively. Among the production types of chickens, high seroprevalence (99.31%) was found in layer poultry, and lower seroprevalence (96.17%) was found in the case of broiler chicken. Significant association was observed among different associated risk factors particularly age, sex, breed, and production types of chickens. From the tested chickens, all  age groups, species, and farm types have high seroprevalence of IBV. The prevalence of IBV was highly significant (p ≤ 0.01) in the study site. The risk factors indicated could have increased infection prevalence, pathogens' economic  impact, and disease occurrence. Conclusion: IBD is complicating factor affecting poultry production systems in the area. Vaccine and biosecurity measures are recommended for the control of IBV. Furtherly, identification and characterization (by using RT-PCR) of persistent serotype of IBV circulating in the field are recommended.	0
35036414	Integrated Analysis of mRNA and MicroRNA Co-expressed Network for the Differentiation of Bovine Skeletal Muscle Cells After Polyphenol Resveratrol Treatment.	Resveratrol (RSV) has been confirmed to benefit human health. Resveratrol supplemented in the feeds of animals improved pork, chicken, and duck meat qualities. In this study, we identified differentially expressed (DE) messenger RNAs (mRNAs) (n = 3,856) and microRNAs (miRNAs) (n = 93) for the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to investigate the co-expressed DE mRNAs and DE miRNAs in the primary bovine myoblasts after RSV treatment. The mRNA results indicated that RSV treatments had high correlations with turquoise module (0.91, P-value = 0.01) and blue module (0.93, P-value < 0.01), while only the turquoise module (0.96, P-value < 0.01) was highly correlated with the treatment  status using miRNA data. After biological enrichment analysis, the 2,579 DE genes in the turquoise module were significantly enriched in the Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. The top two GO terms were actin filament-based process (GO:0030029) and actin cytoskeleton organization (GO:0030036). The top two KEGG pathways were regulation of actin cytoskeleton (bta04810) and tight junction (bta04530). Then, we constructed the DE mRNA co-expression and DE miRNA co-expression networks in the turquoise module and the mRNA-miRNA targeting networks based on their co-expressions in the key module. In summary, the RSV-induced miRNAs participated in the co-expression networks that could affect mRNA expressions to regulate the primary myoblast differentiation. Our study provided a better understanding of the roles of RSV in inducing miRNA and of the characteristics of DE miRNAs in the key co-expressed module in regulation of mRNAs and revealed new candidate regulatory miRNAs and genes for the beef quality traits.	0
34588614	Impact of feed glyphosate residues on broiler breeder egg production and egg hatchability.	Glyphosate is the active substance in glyphosate-based herbicides, e.g. Roundup.  Its widespread application on feed crops leaves residues in the feed. Glyphosate  has antimicrobial and mineral chelating properties and we investigated whether there is an association between feed residues of glyphosate on the one side and broiler breeder egg laying percent and egg hatchability on the other side. Twenty-six feed samples from five conventional flocks producing hatching eggs were analysed for glyphosate. Data on laying percent and egg hatchability from periods following each feed sampling were then associated with feed residues of glyphosate. The average glyphosate residue level was 0.09 mg/kg, maximum was 0.19 and minimum was 0.004 mg/kg. Average laying percent over observation days was 65% (SD = 5.4%) and average hatchability was 79% (SD = 5.8%). We found a negative association between feed glyphosate residue level and hatchability (P = 0.03) when adjusted for breeder age, storage time of eggs on farm before delivery and storage time at hatchery before incubation start. No association was found with laying percent (P = 0.59) adjusted for breeder age. The range of glyphosate concentrations in feed was narrow and should be kept in mind when interpreting both significant and non-significant associations with glyphosate residue concentrations. In nine of 24 analysed conventional eggs the concentration of glyphosate in yolk was above the detection limit however below the quantification limit indicating that traces of glyphosate are common in conventional eggs.	0
34659257	"Immune Phenomena in Myeloid Neoplasms: An ""Egg or Chicken"" Question."	Immune phenomena are increasingly reported in myeloid neoplasms, and include autoimmune cytopenias/diseases and immunodeficiency, either preceding or complicating acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms, and bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes. Autoimmunity and immunodeficiency are the two faces of a dysregulated immune tolerance and surveillance and may result, along with contributing environmental  and genetic factors, in an increased incidence of both tumors and infections. The latter may fuel both autoimmunity and immune activation, triggering a vicious circle among infections, tumors and autoimmune phenomena. Additionally, alterations of the microbiota and of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) pinpoint to the importance of a permissive or hostile microenvironment for tumor growth. Finally, several therapies of myeloid neoplasms are aimed at increasing host immunity against the tumor, but at the price of increased autoimmune phenomena. In this review we will examine the epidemiological association of myeloid neoplasms with autoimmune diseases and immunodeficiencies, and the pivotal role of autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of MDS and BMF syndromes, including the paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria conundrum. Furthermore, we will briefly examine autoimmune complications following therapy of myeloid neoplasms, as well  as the role of MSCs and microbiota in these settings.	0
34458330	The Association of Left Atrial Appendage Morphology to Atrial Fibrillation Recurrence After Radiofrequency Ablation.	Objective: The probability of late recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF) after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has not yet been fully clarified. This study aims to study the association of left atrial appendage (LAA) morphology with AF recurrence after RFA. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 84 patients (24 patients had persistent AF, 60 patients had paroxysmal AF) who underwent RFA in Shanghai East Hospital from June 2014 to May 2018. The mean follow-up of these patients was 618.6 days. According to preoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), the morphology feature of LAA was classified and evaluated by two classification methods. The first method was divided into chicken-wing, windsock, cactus, and cauliflower, and the second method was divided into one lobe, two lobes, and multiple lobes. The correlation between morphological feature of LAA and the recurrence rate of AF after RFA was analyzed. Results: During follow-up, 12 patients (50%) and 10 patients (16.7%) had AF recurrence in persistent and paroxysmal AF, respectively. The LAA morphology was associated with the recurrence of AF after RFA with the chicken-wing highest recurrence risk (68.2%). The structure type of LAA was also  related to the AF recurrence rate (p < 0.01). Compared with one lobe and multiple lobes, two lobes (recurrence, 47.6%) were more likely associated with the recurrence of AF (p < 0.02). Logistic regression analysis showed that the chicken-wing group had a higher risk of recurrence after RFA (OR = 8.13, p = 0.004), and the windsock group had a lower risk of recurrence (OR = 0.17, p = 0.002). Conclusion: The morphological feature of LAA is related to the recurrence risk of AF after RFA. LAA morphology assessment can predict the risk of AF recurrence.	0
34807789	Retroviral association with ovarian adenocarcinoma in laying hens.	The laying hen has been used as a model for ovarian adenocarcinoma (OAC) in women. Previous work has shown an association between expression of endogenous retroviral proteins and elevated envelope mRNA and occurrence of OAC in humans, but causality has not been demonstrated. The objective of this study was to determine whether there is a similar association between retrovirus presence and  OAC in a commercial laying hen flock at the University of Illinois Poultry Research facility with a history of a high OAC prevalence in older hens. Laying hens of three age strata were randomly selected for a cross-sectional study. Blood samples were collected, and serum was tested for antigens of endogenous or  exogenous avian leukosis virus (ALV) by ELISA. Birds were humanely euthanized, and spleens, ovaries, and any tissues with gross lesions were sampled. Ovaries and gross lesions were examined histologically and spleens were used for RT-PCR to detect endogenous ALV via ALV-E env mRNA expression. Overall, hens with OAC were 5.2 times more likely to be ALV positive than hens without OAC (95% C.I. 2.06-13.14). Controlled for age, OAC positive hens were 3.6 times more likely to  be positive for ALV via antigen-capture ELISA (95% C.I. 1.08-11.96). Endogenous ALV-E in hens may be analogous to human endogenous retroviruses, which have also  been associated with OAC in women. Further studies to establish causation are warranted to better understand the potential for laying hens to serve as a laboratory model for viral-induced ovarian tumours in humans. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTSOAC in hens was associated with age, seropositivity for ALV, and endogenous ALV mRNA expression.Older hens with OAC were more likely to be ALV seropositive by ELISA and ALV-E mRNA-positive.Associations between OAC, age, and  endogenous retrovirus expression have been reported in humans.These findings support the use of hens as models for OAC in humans.	0
34971779	Effects of mineral additives on antibiotic resistance genes and related mechanisms during chicken manure composting.	In this study, two typical minerals (diatomite and bentonite) were applied during composting, and their influences on antibiotics, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), intI1 and the bacterial communities were investigated. The relative abundance of total ARGs decreased by 53.72% and 59.54% in diatomite and bentonite addition compared with control on day 42. The minerals addition also reduced the  relative abundance of intI1, as much as 41.41% and 59.81% in diatomite and bentonite treatments. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the dominant candidate hosts of the major ARGs. There was a significant correlation between total ARGs and intI1 during the composting. Structural equation models further demonstrated  that intI1 and antibiotics were the predominant direct factors responsible for ARG variations, and composting properties and bacterial community composition also shifted the variation of ARG profiles by influencing intI1. Overall, these findings suggest that diatomite and bentonite could decrease the potential proliferation of ARGs in chicken manure.	0
34684399	Food Taste, Dietary Consumption, and Food Preference Perception of Changes Following Bariatric Surgery in the Saudi Population: A Cross-Sectional Study.	BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery is known as the most effective treatment resulting  in long-term weight loss for obesity. However, behavioral changes, including food preference, food allergies, and consumption, between groups of patients who underwent bariatric surgery in comparison with people who did not have bariatric  surgery have not been fully discussed in the literature. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to describe patient-reported changes of perception related to food preferences, consumption, and food allergies in participants who underwent bariatric surgery and to compare their food consumption with participants who did not have bariatric surgery in Saudi Arabia. METHODOLOGY: This study is a secondary analysis of the Sharik Diet and Health National Survey (SDHNS) conducted in July 2021. Quota sampling was utilized to generate balanced distributions of participants by age and gender across all administrative regions of Saudi Arabia. Data collection included sociodemographic information (age, gender, and educational level), as well as food habits and the  consumption of various food categories. RESULTS: Of the 6267 potential participants contacted in 2021 from the 13 administrative regions of Saudi Arabia, 5228 successfully completed the interview, with a response rate of 83.4%. Gender was distributed equally among the total participants in the sample. The prevalence of bariatric surgeries in Saudi Arabia was estimated at around 4.1% of the total sample. More than 36% of people who had bariatric surgery experienced food taste changes, and around 15% reported a decrease in allergic reactions to food. Moreover, 68.1% had food preference changes, either starting to favor a new food or no longer favoring one. There was a significant association between consuming more red meat, chicken, and energy drinks and a decreased consumption of grains and rice among those who had the bariatric surgery compared with those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that more than two-thirds of people who had bariatric surgery self-reported food taste and food preference changes. More studies should be performed on the Saudi population, including clinical follow-up, to better understand these changes.	0
35082062	Third-generation cephalosporin (3GC) resistance and its association with Extra-intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC). Focus on broiler carcasses.	The worldwide spread of Extra-intestinal Pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC), together with the antimicrobial resistance linked with extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and plasmid-mediated AmpC β-lactamases (pAmpCs) are pressing threats for public health. This study aimed to investigate the presence of ExPEC  genes in third-generation cephalosporin (3 GC)-resistant E. coli and to study their distribution in broiler carcasses at the slaughterhouse after the chilling  process. To this purpose, isolates from a collection of 3 GC-resistant E. coli from carcasses of broilers originating from twelve broiler farms and three production chains were investigated. Several multivariate statistical approaches  were adopted to elucidate the relationships among features. Phylogroup F was predominant in all broiler batches and was mainly associated with blaTEM and ESBL genes but less correlated to ExPEC genes. Another remarkable finding was the predominance of ExPEC strains assigned to uncommon phylogroups, such as B2, D, E  and Clade I, commonly found into the environment. This study represents a first step for a comprehensive characterization of ExPEC genes harboured by 3 GC-resistant E. coli. These findings may be valuable for the identification of  potential risks associated to broiler carcasses as source of uncommon E. coli phylogroups.	0
34827274	Molecular Characteristics and Antimicrobial Resistance of Salmonella enterica Serovar Schwarzengrund from Chicken Meat in Japan.	Our previous study revealed that Salmonella enterica serovar Schwarzengrund-contaminated areas of broiler chickens have expanded from West Japan to East Japan. The present study investigated the antimicrobial resistance  and molecular characteristics of 124 S. Schwarzengrund isolates obtained from chicken meat produced in East and West Japan from 2008 to 2019. Comparing the isolates obtained in 2008 and 2015-2019, an increase in the proportion of those resistant to kanamycin [51.4-89.7% (p < 0.001)] was observed. In contrast, the proportion of isolates resistant to both streptomycin and tetracycline and those  that harbored a 1.0-kb class 1 integron, aadA1, and tetA, significantly decreased from 100% in 2008 to 47.1% in 2015-2019 (p < 0.001). A 1.0-kb class 1 integron containing aadA1, harbored by 78 isolates, was different from that reported in globally distributed S. Schwarzengrund strains (1.9 kb, containing the dfrA12-aadA2 gene cassette). Twenty-five isolates from different product districts and years of isolation were typed as sequence type (ST) 241 with multilocus sequence typing. Our results suggest that S. Schwarzengrund, which contaminates chicken meat in Japan, shares a common ancestor regardless of the product district from 2008 to recent years. Moreover, S. Schwarzengrund ST241 may have spread from western to eastern Japan.	0
35156546	Serological evaluation of Newcastle disease protection among broilers at a live bird market in Kano, Northwest Nigeria, and its epidemiological significance.	Vaccination is a tool of Newcastle disease (ND) control among broilers. This study aimed at determining the immunity status of sampled broilers against ND at  a live bird market in Kano, Northwest Nigeria, and its epidemiological implication. A cross-sectional study of antibodies against Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was carried out among broiler chicken in a live bird market in Kano State, Northwest Nigeria. A total of 471 samples was tested successfully. NDV antibody titer was assayed using hemagglutination-inhibition test (HI) and ND indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serological levels of NDV antibodies were 67.9% (ELISA) and 78.1% (HI). Also, 67 (20.9%) samples tested positive for ELISA but negative for HI, whereas 115 (31.3%) samples tested negative for ELISA but positive for HI. There is strong association between the immune status obtained from both tests (P < .05), significant difference exists between the immune titer obtained from both tests (P < .05). Protective antibody  titer among the test subjects suggests individual protection against virulent NDV (vNDV) strain; however, protective levels ≥85% that confers herd immunity were not attained. This report emphasizes the need for farmers to be more compliant to ND vaccination schedule and best practices in their poultry farm to enhance ND control in Live Bird Markets (LBMs).	0
35256120	Ascaridia galli and Heterakis gallinarum prevalence and genetic variance of A. galli in rural chicken from the Northern Region, Ghana.	Rural chicken production in Ghana is predominantly done under the extensive system that exposes birds to parasitic infections. We investigated the prevalence of Ascaridia spp. and Heterakis spp. and as a preliminary study characterized the genetic variance of the Ascaridia galli isolates from rural chicken in Kumbungu,  Savelugu and Tolon Districts in the Northern Region, Ghana. A total of 86 chickens aged 6-10 weeks were dissected and GIT inspected for nematodes. Nematode were described based on morphological features to be A. galli and H. gallinarum.  Additionally, the mitochondrial cox1 gene (475 bp) of Ascaridia isolates was amplified and sequenced. The overall prevalence of nematodes was 47.67%: A. galli 37.21% and H. gallinarum 20.93%. Prevalence values of A. galli in the Kumbungu, Savelugu and Tolon Districts were 25.00%, 36.00%, 56.00%, respectively, and that  of H. gallinarum, respectively were 16.67%, 28.00% and 20.00%. A Chi-square test  (x2 = 6.0907, p < 0.048) showed an association of A. galli prevalence to the district of origin of birds. From 20 A. galli cox1 sequences analyzed, all sequences were identified as A. galli. Two haplotypes were recorded, namely, GHA1 and GHA2. Haplotype GHA1 was found to have wide distribution globally, whereas GHA2 appear to be novel in the present study. The data shows the importance of A. galli and H. gallinarum infection in rural chicken in northern Ghana and pave way for further epidemiological study of avian nematodes.	0
35065879	Prevalence of markers of atrial cardiomyopathy in embolic stroke of undetermined  source: A systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests the potential role of atrial cardiomyopathy (AC) as a direct thromboembolic determinant in embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to quantify the prevalence of potential AC markers among ESUS, non-cardioembolic (NCE) and cardioembolic (CE) stroke patients. METHODS: PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)  were searched for publications from inception to October 2021, with duplicate data extraction and risk of bias assessment. The Newcastle-Ottawa assessment scale was used to evaluate study quality. RESULTS: Among 398 screened studies, 11 observational studies with 2009 ESUS patients (mean age 66.5 years) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of electrocardiographic markers, increased P-wave terminal force in lead V1 was more prevalent in ESUS vs NCE (OR=2.26, 95%CI: 1.40-3.66). Of imaging markers, left atrial volume index (LAVI) and left atrial diameter (LAd) were higher in ESUS vs  NCE (OR=1.04, 95%CI: 1.02-1.06 and OR=3.41, 95%CI: 1.35-8.61 respectively). Non-chicken wing morphology of the left atrial appendage was more frequent in ESUS compared to NCE patients in the majority of studies. Of serum biomarkers, the prevalence of NT-proBNP >250 pg/ml did not differ among ESUS vs NCE (OR=0.73, 95%CI: 0.39 -1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Electrocardiographic, echocardiographic markers and advanced imaging modalities able to assess the morphologic characteristics of left atrial appendage and left atrial function may be important tools to discriminate AC among ESUS vs NCE stroke patients. Prospective studies exploring the association  of potential AC markers with ESUS occurrence are warranted to validate their clinical utility.	0
35057849	Dermanyssus gallinae: the long journey of the poultry red mite to become a vector.	The possibility that Dermanyssus gallinae, the poultry red mite, could act as a vector of infectious disease-causing pathogens has always intrigued researchers and worried commercial chicken farmers, as has its ubiquitous distribution. For decades, studies have been carried out which suggest that there is an association between a wide range of pathogens and D. gallinae, with the transmission of some  of these pathogens mediated by D. gallinae as vector. The latter include the avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC), Salmonella enterica serovars Enteritidis and Gallinarum and influenza virus. Several approaches have been adopted to investigate the relationship between D. gallinae and pathogens. In this comprehensive review, we critically describe available strategies and methods currently available for conducting trials, as well as outcomes, analyzing their possible strengths and weaknesses, with the aim to provide researchers with useful tools for correctly approach the study of the vectorial role of D. gallinae.	0
34923879	Two novel InDels within the promoter of SIRT1 are associated with growth traits in chickens.	1. The objectives of the present study were to elucidate the relationship between novel variations of the SIRT1 gene and chicken growth traits. In total, 1,429 chickens, including six breeds and a Gushi ×Anka F2 resource population, were genotyped using PCR-RFLP.2. Two novel InDels (c.-1552_-1553insCG and c.-450_-451delCG) in the promoter of the chicken SIRT1 gene were identified. An association study showed that c.-1552_-1553insCG was significantly correlated with growth traits and serum lipid indicators.3. The insertion genotype was most  highly associated with body weight at day old, two- and four-week-old chickens, and with shank circumference at four and eight weeks of age. The wild type genotype at this site was most highly associated with serum lipid indicators.4. In contrast, c.-450_-451delCG was significantly correlated with muscle fibre diameter. The SIRT1 gene expression in chickens with different InDel genotypes was analysed and was significantly higher with heterozygous genotypes at both sites in muscle and fat tissue, relative to expression in chickens with the corresponding homozygous genotypes.5. The effects of different haplotypes on SIRT1 promoter activity showed that promoter activity depends on haplotype, with  haplotype HapII exhibiting the highest activity.6. It was concluded that the SIRT1 gene is associated with chicken growth traits and that the two InDels influence SIRT1 promoter activity in chickens.	0
34597342	Dynamically expressed genes provide candidate viability biomarkers in a model coccidian.	Eimeria parasites cause enteric disease in livestock and the closely related Cyclospora cayetanensis causes human disease. Oocysts of these coccidian parasites undergo maturation (sporulation) before becoming infectious. Here, we assessed transcription in maturing oocysts of Eimeria acervulina, a widespread chicken parasite, predicted gene functions, and determined which of these genes also occur in C. cayetanensis. RNA-Sequencing yielded ~2 billion paired-end reads, 92% of which mapped to the E. acervulina genome. The ~6,900 annotated genes underwent temporally-coordinated patterns of gene expression. Fifty-three genes each contributed >1,000 transcripts per million (TPM) throughout the study  interval, including cation-transporting ATPases, an oocyst wall protein, a palmitoyltransferase, membrane proteins, and hypothetical proteins. These genes were enriched for 285 gene ontology (GO) terms and 13 genes were ascribed to 17 KEGG pathways, defining housekeeping processes and functions important throughout sporulation. Expression differed in mature and immature oocysts for 40% (2,928) of all genes; of these, nearly two-thirds (1,843) increased their expression over time. Eight genes expressed most in immature oocysts, encoding proteins promoting oocyst maturation and development, were assigned to 37 GO terms and 5 KEGG pathways. Fifty-six genes underwent significant upregulation in mature oocysts, each contributing at least 1,000 TPM. Of these, 40 were annotated by 215 GO assignments and 9 were associated with 18 KEGG pathways, encoding products involved in respiration, carbon fixation, energy utilization, invasion, motility, and stress and detoxification responses. Sporulation orchestrates coordinated changes in the expression of many genes, most especially those governing metabolic activity. Establishing the long-term fate of these transcripts in sporulated oocysts and in senescent and deceased oocysts will further elucidate the biology of coccidian development, and may provide tools to assay infectiousness of parasite cohorts. Moreover, because many of these genes have homologues in C. cayetanensis, they may prove useful as biomarkers for risk.	0
34607956	Cis-acting mutation affecting GJA5 transcription is underlying the Melanotic within-feather pigmentation pattern in chickens.	Melanotic (Ml) is a mutation in chickens that extends black (eumelanin) pigmentation in normally brown or red (pheomelanin) areas, thus affecting multiple within-feather patterns [J. W. Moore, J. R. Smyth Jr, J. Hered. 62, 215-219 (1971)]. In the present study, linkage mapping using a back-cross between Dark Cornish (Ml/Ml) and Partridge Plymouth Rock (ml + /ml + ) chickens assigned  Ml to an 820-kb region on chromosome 1. Identity-by-descent mapping, via whole-genome sequencing and diagnostic tests using a diverse set of chickens, refined the localization to the genomic region harboring GJA5 encoding gap-junction protein 5 (alias connexin 40) previously associated with pigmentation patterns in zebrafish. An insertion/deletion polymorphism located in the vicinity of the GJA5 promoter region was identified as the candidate causal mutation. Four different GJA5 transcripts were found to be expressed in feather follicles and at least two showed differential expression between genotypes. The  results showed that Melanotic constitutes a cis-acting regulatory mutation affecting GJA5 expression. A recent study established the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) locus and the interaction between the MC1R receptor and its antagonist agouti-signaling protein as the primary mechanism underlying variation in within-feather pigmentation patterns in chickens. The present study advances understanding the mechanisms underlying variation in plumage color in birds because it demonstrates that the activity of connexin 40/GJA5 can modulate the periodic pigmentation patterns within individual feathers.	0
34811413	Unequal burden of equal risk factors of diabetes between different gender in India: a cross-sectional analysis.	Many studies have supported that the burden of diabetes is shared differently by  different genders due to various factors associated with it. This study aims at capturing whether women and men with a similar background, dietary and smoking habits, and biological conditions (blood pressure and body mass index (BMI)) are  being affected equally or differently by diabetes. We have used cross-sectional data of NFHS-4 by covering the age group 15-49 years. Association between socio-economic background, dietary habits, biological conditions, and diabetes has been estimated using two separate multivariate logistic regression models. Results show that the overall prevalence of diabetes is higher among men (2.63%)  than women (2.35%). Whereas, women belonging to urban areas (3.53%), Christian category (3.92%), richer section (3.22%), women with no schooling (2.51%), those  reported never to consume pulses (2.66%) and green vegetables (2.40%) and daily consuming eggs (3.66%) and chicken or meat (3.54%) are more affected by diabetes  than their men counterparts. Whereas men residing in rural areas (2.30%), belonging to the general category (3.12%), SCs (2.37%) and STs (1.72%) are more affected than their women counterparts. Results have also shown a higher prevalence of diabetes among obese men (11.46%), non-vegetarian (2.71%) and those who watch television almost every day (3.03%) as compared to their women counterparts. Regression analyses show that the richest, hypertensive, and obese  women and men are significantly more likely to suffer from diabetes. This study concludes that women and men with similar socio-economic status, biological conditions, dietary and smoking habits are being affected differently by diabetes. Thus, there is a need for gender dimension in research to understand and validate the differences in the needed interventions for diabetes control in  India.	0
35301570	Avian leukosis virus (ALV) is highly prevalent in fancy-chicken flocks in Saxony.	The current prevalence of avian leukosis virus (ALV) in fancy chickens in Germany is unknown. Therefore, 537 cloacal swabs from 50 purebred fancy-chicken flocks in Saxony were tested for the presence of the ALV p27 protein using a commercial antigen-capture ELISA. The detection rate was 28.7% at the individual-animal level and 56.0% at the flock level. Phylogenetic analysis of PCR products obtained from 22 different flocks revealed the highest similarity to ALV subtype  K. When classifying breeds by their origin, ALV detection rates differed significantly. Evaluation of questionnaire data revealed no significant differences between ALV-positive and negative flocks regarding mortality.	0
35092237	Northeastern Conference on Avian Diseases from 1928-2021: 93 Years of Contributions to Organized Avian Medicine.	Bacillary white diarrhea in chickens was a major disease concern for the poultry  industry during the early 1900s. Drs. L. F. Rettger and W. R. Hinshaw organized a meeting in 1928 to discuss methods for controlling this disease. In this meeting, representatives of five northeastern states discussed approaches to test for the  presence of the etiological agent of bacillary white diarrhea, namely, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Pullorum. Meeting attendees decided to have a yearly meeting of the Northeastern Conference of Laboratory Workers in Bacillary  White Diarrhea. The next year, the name was changed to Conference of Laboratory Workers in Pullorum Disease Eradication, which was changed to Northeastern Conference on Avian Diseases (NECAD) in 1957. Not only has NECAD been important for the control of pullorum disease but also, starting with the fifth Annual Conference in 1932, other poultry diseases became an official part of the program. As such, NECAD served for a long time as the premier organization to present new information on avian diseases. The success of NECAD was based on the  work of the many committees, which are described in detail in this review. For example, the antigen committee started officially in 1929 and remained active until at least 1987. The main task of this committee was to evaluate Salmonella Pullorum strains to be used by all participants in the pullorum antibody testing  programs. NECAD started as a closed organization with participants from universities and government organizations but did not allow representatives from  commercial groups until 1968 when all American Association of Avian Pathologists  (AAAP) members in the Northeastern United States could participate. The journal Avian Diseases started with discussions by Dr. P. P. Levine with M. S. Cover, H.  L. Chute, R. F. Gentry, E. Jungherr, and H. Van Roekel about the idea that NECAD  would sponsor a journal dealing specifically with avian diseases. During the first few years of Avian Diseases publication, many articles including abstracts  came from the NECAD Annual Conferences. The importance of NECAD as a precursor for other regional meetings and the AAAP and as a forum for graduate students to  present their research are described. Several recipients of the award for the best paper presented by a graduate student have continued to work in avian disease research. The decline in the participation of scientists in the late 1990s and early 2000s was discussed extensively in 2006 and led to a merger of the NECAD meeting with the Pennsylvania Poultry Sales and Service Conference. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 92nd Annual Conference was a virtual meeting in 2020. Fortunately, the 93rd Annual Conference in 2021 was an in-person meeting held in State College, PA.	0
34991478	Genome-wide association study identifies SNPs for growth performance and serum indicators in Valgus-varus deformity broilers (Gallus gallus) using ddGBS sequencing.	BACKGROUND: Valgus-varus deformity (VVD) is a lateral or middle deviation of the  tibiotarsus or tarsometatarsus, which is associated with compromised growth, worse bone quality and abnormal changes in serum indicators in broilers. To investigate the genetic basis of VVD, a genome wide association study (GWAS) was  performed to identify candidate genes and pathways that are responsible for VVD leg disease, serum indicators and growth performance in broilers. RESULTS: In total, VVD phenotype, seven serum indicators and three growth traits  were measured for 126 VVD broilers (case group) and 122 sound broilers (control group) based on a high throughput genome wide genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) method. After quality control 233 samples (113 sound broilers and 120 VVD birds)  and 256,599 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) markers were used for further  analysis. As a result, a total of 5 SNPs were detected suggestively significantly associated with VVD and 70 candidate genes were identified that included or adjacent to these significant SNPs. In addition, 43 SNPs located on Chr24 (0.22 Mb - 1.79 Mb) were genome-wide significantly associated with serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and 38 candidate genes were identified. Functional enrichment analysis showed that these genes are involved in two Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to bone development (cartilage development and cartilage condensation) and two pathways related to skeletal development (Toll-like receptor signaling pathway and p53 signaling pathway). BARX2 (BARX homeobox 2) and Panx3 (Pannexin 3) related to skeleton diseases and bone quality were obtained according to functional analysis. According to the integration of GWAS with transcriptome analysis, HYLS1 (HYLS1 centriolar and ciliogenesis associated) was an important susceptibility gene. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide some reference for understanding the relationship between metabolic mechanism of ALP and pathogenesis of VVD, which will provide a theoretical basis for disease-resistant breeding of chicken leg soundness.	0
35250914	Multi-Omics Association Reveals the Effects of Intestinal Microbiome-Host Interactions on Fat Deposition in Broilers.	Growing evidence indicates that gut microbiota factors cannot be viewed as independent in the occurrence of obesity. Because the gut microbiome is highly dimensional and complex, studies on interactions between gut microbiome and host  in obesity are still rare. To explore the relationship of gut microbiome-host interactions with obesity, we performed multi-omics associations of gut metagenome, intestinal transcriptome, and host obesity phenotypes in divergently  selected obese-lean broiler lines. Metagenomic shotgun sequencing generated a total of 450 gigabases of clean data from 80 intestinal segment contents of 20 broilers (10 of each line). The microbiome comparison showed that microbial diversity and composition in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and ceca were altered  variously between the lean- and fat-line broilers. We identified two jejunal microbes (Escherichia coli and Candidatus Acetothermia bacterium) and four cecal  microbes (Alistipes sp. CHKCI003, Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6, Clostridiales bacterium, and Anaeromassilibacillus sp. An200), which were significantly different between the two lines (FDR < 0.05). When comparing functional metagenome, the fat-line broilers had an intensive microbial metabolism in the duodenum and jejunum but degenerative microbial activities in the ileum and ceca. mRNA-sequencing identified a total of 1,667 differentially expressed genes (DEG)  in the four intestinal compartments between the two lines (| log2FC| > 1.5 and FDR < 0.05). Multi-omics associations showed that the 14 microbial species with abundances that were significantly related with abdominal fat relevant traits (AFRT) also have significant correlations with 155 AFRT-correlated DEG (p < 0.05). These DEG were mainly involved in lipid metabolism, immune system, transport and catabolism, and cell growth-related pathways. The present study constructed a gut microbial gene catalog of the obese-lean broiler lines. Intestinal transcriptome and metagenome comparison between the two lines identified candidate DEG and differential microbes for obesity, respectively. Multi-omics associations suggest that abdominal fat deposition may be influenced  by the interactions of specific gut microbiota abundance and the expression of host genes in the intestinal compartments in which the microbes reside. Our study explored the interactions between gut microbiome and host intestinal gene expression in lean and obese broilers, which may expand knowledge on the relationships between obesity and gut microbiome.	0
35007930	Research Note: MHCY haplotype impacts Campylobacter jejuni colonization in a backcross [(Line 61 x Line N) x Line N] population.	MHCY is a candidate region for influencing immune responses in chickens. MHCY contains multiple specialized, polymorphic MHC class I loci along with loci belonging to 4 additional gene families. In this study, MHCY haplotypes were tested for association with cecal colonization after Campylobacter jejuni infection of a backcross [(Line 61 × Line N) × Line N] population derived from 2  White Leghorn research lines, Line 61 and Line N, that were previously shown to exhibit heritable differences in colonization. Samples were obtained for 51 birds challenged with 108 CFU Campylobacter jejuni at 3 wk of age. Viable C. jejuni in  the ceca were enumerated 5 d postinfection and counts were log-transformed for analysis. Birds were assigned to either low or high colonization groups based on  the individual count being below or above the mean bacterial count for all birds. The mean bacterial count of the low infection group differed significantly from the high infection group. Sex and MHCB haplotype had similar distributions within the 2 groups. Overall, 7 MHCY haplotypes were found to be segregating. Two were significantly associated with C. jejuni colonization. MHCY Y18 was associated with low colonization (P = 3.00 × 10-5); whereas MHCY Y11a was associated with high colonization (P = 0.008). The MHCY haplotype impacted the mean bacterial count among all birds with MHCY Y18 having the lowest bacterial count compared with MHCY Y11a and all other MHCY (Y5, Y7, Y8, Y11b, and Y11c) haplotypes. These  findings support further investigation of the contribution of chicken MHCY in resistance to Campylobacter colonization.	0
34581031	Genome-wide scan for selective footprints and genes related to cold tolerance in  Chantecler chickens.	The Chantecler chicken, a unique Canadian indigenous breed, is well adapted to extremely cold environments. However, its genetic characteristics have not been well studied. Here, we analyzed the whole genomes of 10 Chantecler chickens and 121 worldwide chickens, which indicated that Chantecler chickens were derived from commercial chickens and exhibit a high level of inbreeding. Based on a genome-wide scan, we identified two vital candidate regions containing ME3 and ZNF536, which are related to fat metabolism and nervous system in cold adaptation, respectively. We also found that the genetic mechanism of cold adaptation in Chantecler chickens differed from that of chickens from other cold  regions, such as northern China. Our study indicated that specialized commercial  chickens in the early 20th century contained sufficient genetic diversity to adapt to extreme cold environments over a very short time. These findings enrich  our understanding of the adaptive potential of commercial species.	0
34675224	Analysis of potential regulatory LncRNAs and CircRNAs in the oxidative myofiber and glycolytic myofiber of chickens.	SART and PMM are mainly composed of oxidative myofibers and glycolytic myofibers, respectively, and myofiber types profoundly influence postnatal muscle growth and meat quality. SART and PMM are composed of lncRNAs and circRNAs that participate  in myofiber type regulation. To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of myofiber type, lncRNA and circRNA sequencing was used to systematically compare the transcriptomes of the SART and PMM of Chinese female Qingyuan partridge chickens  at their marketing age. The luminance value (L*), redness value (a*), average diameter, cross-sectional area, and density difference between the PMM and SART were significant (p < 0.05). ATPase staining results showed that PMMs were all darkly stained and belonged to the glycolytic type, and the proportion of oxidative myofibers in SART was 81.7%. A total of 5 420 lncRNAs were identified,  of which 365 were differentially expressed in the SART compared with the PMM (p < 0.05). The cis-regulatory analysis identified target genes that were enriched for specific GO terms and KEGG pathways (p < 0.05), including striated muscle cell differentiation, regulation of cell proliferation, regulation of muscle cell differentiation, myoblast differentiation, regulation of myoblast differentiation, and MAPK signaling pathway. Pathways and coexpression network analyses suggested that XR_003077811.1, XR_003072304.1, XR_001465942.2, XR_001465741.2, XR_001470487.1, XR_003077673.1 and XR_003074785.1 played important roles in regulating oxidative myofibers by TBX3, QKI, MYBPC1, CALM2, and PPARGC1A expression. A total of 10 487 circRNAs were identified, of which 305 circRNAs were differentially expressed in the SART compared with the PMM (p < 0.05). Functional enrichment analysis showed that differentially expressed circRNAs were involved in host gene expression and were enriched in the AMPK, calcium signaling pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway, and cellular senescence. Novel_circ_004282 and novel_circ_002121 played important roles in regulating oxidative myofibers by PPP3CA and NFATC1 expression. Using lncRNA-miRNA/circRNA-miRNA integrated analysis, we identified many candidate interaction networks that might affect muscle fiber performance. Important lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks, such as lncRNA-XR_003074785.1/miR-193-3p/PPARGC1A, regulate oxidative myofibers. This study reveals that lncXR_003077811.1, lncXR_003072304.1, lncXR_001465942.2, lncXR_001465741.2, lncXR_001470487.1, lncXR_003077673.1, XR_003074785.1, novel_circ_004282 and novel_circ_002121 might  regulate oxidative myofibers. The lncRNA-XR_003074785.1/miR-193-3p/PPARGC1A pathway might regulate oxidative myofibers. All these findings provide rich resources for further in-depth research on the regulatory mechanism of lncRNAs and circRNAs in myofibers.	0
34747677	Runs of homozygosity analysis reveals population characteristics of yellow-feathered chickens using re-sequencing data.	1. To evaluate the inbreeding of yellow-feathered chickens (YFCs) and identify genes related to their unique characteristics, whole-genome re-sequencing data were applied to detect runs of homozygosity (ROH) in the genomes of 10 YFC chickens from each of 10 different YFC breeds. The number, length, distribution of ROH, and inbreeding coefficient in different YFC populations were calculated.  Genomic regions with high frequency in ROH were annotated.2. In total, 25,547 ROH with an average length of 335 kb were detected, with most being <1 Mb. The domination of short ROH reflected the long breeding history of this chicken. The  number, length, frequency, and distribution of ROH varied among chicken populations, and high genetic diversity was maintained.3. Numerous genes related  to YFC characteristics were identified in the high-frequency ROH regions. Among these, IFNA, IFNB, IL11 RA, IL22 RA1, IFNLR1, and TRIF genes were involved in disease resistance. The AMY, G6PC, SDHB, GCNT4, and ACO genes were associated with energy material metabolism; and FABPL, AQP7, ACAA2, and RYR2 were related to meat quality and flavour. The KITLG, CREB3, RYR2, and LGR4 genes, related to pigmentation, were detected.4. This ROH-based inbreeding evaluation lays the foundation for breeding and conservation of YFC populations, and the candidate genes identified can be used for marker-assisted selection.	0
35286234	Generation of an avian influenza DIVA vaccine with a H3-peptide replacement located at HA2 against both highly and low pathogenic H7N9 virus.	A differentiating infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) vaccine is an ideal strategy for viral eradication in poultry. Here, according to the emerging highly pathogenic H7N9 avian influenza virus (AIV), a DIVA vaccine strain, named rGD4HALo-mH3-TX, was successfully developed, based on a substituted 12 peptide of H3 virus located at HA2. In order to meet with the safety requirement of vaccine  production, the multi-basic amino acid located at the HA cleavage site was modified. Meanwhile, six inner viral genes from a H9N2 AIV TX strainwere introduced for increasing viral production. The rGD4HALo-mH3-TX strain displayed  a similar reproductive ability with rGD4 and low pathogenicity in chickens, suggesting a good productivity and safety. In immuned chickens, rGD4HALo-mH3-TX induced a similar antibody level with rGD4 and provided 100% clinical protection  and 90% shedding protection against highly pathogenic virus challenge. rGD4HALo-mH3-TX strain also produced a good cross-protection against low pathogenic AIV JD/17. Moreover, serological DIVA characteristics were evaluated by a successfully established competitive inhibition ELISA based on a 3G10 monoclonal antibody, and the result showed a strong reactivity with antisera of chickens vaccinated with H7 subtype strains but not rGD4HALo-mH3-TX. Collectedly, rGD4HALo-mH3-TX is a promising DIVA vaccine candidate against both high and low pathogenic H7N9 subtype AIV.	0
34902538	Molecular epidemiological studies on avian pathogenic Escherichia coli associated with septicemia in chickens in India.	Bacterial septicemia causes huge economic losses in the poultry industry and there is no systematic research available in India on the connection of various pathogens associated with septicemia. The present molecular epidemiological study was conducted to investigate the association of different bacterial and immunosuppressive viral pathogens in septicemia suspected chickens. A total of 443 chicken carcasses with septicemic conditions from 71 different flocks were included in this study. Heart blood swabs were subjected to bacterial culture for Salmonella spp., Pasteurella multocida, Escherichia coli, and Gallibacterium anatis. Of these 51 flocks tested for E. coli, 49 (96.1%) flocks were found positive. Among flocks tested for Salmonella spp., 2 flocks were found positive.  All tested flocks were found negative for G. anatis and P. multocida as well as air sac swabs tested negative for Mycoplasma spp. Bacterial cultural examination  revealed that majority of septicemic chickens were found to be infected with E. coli and these E. coli isolates showed the highest resistance to vancomycin (60%), followed by erythromycin (50%) and cefotaxime (38%) and maximum sensitivity to cefotaxime and clavulanic acid combinations (81.5%), followed by chloramphenicol (69.6%) and ertapenem (67.2%). Among the 5 avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) virulence genes were detected in 36 flocks and highest frequency of iss (100%), followed by ompT or iutA (97.2%), hly (61.1%) and iroN (47.2%) genes. On polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening, 10.5, 4.5, 52.2, 19.4, 9.0, 4.5, 20.1 and 19.4% of the flocks were positive for G. anatis, Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale, APEC, Salmonella spp., Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Mycoplasma synoviae, chicken infectious anemia virus and Marek's disease virus, respectively. To our knowledge, the present study is first on the etiology of septicemia in chicken flocks in India. The present study infers that the majority of septicemic deaths in broiler chickens less than 8 weeks have been connected with APEC and majority of E. coli isolates are multidrug resistance, suggesting the need for surveillance and intervention to curb the inadvertent use of antibiotics. Although, incidence of G. anatis association with septicemia was reported, still requires a rigorous epidemiological study to determine the actual prevalence. However, more detailed studies encompassing vast geographical area with large sample size and long duration of the studies are necessary to provide  a clear picture of the interaction of different pathogens causing septicemia in chicken.	0
34686130	Impact of the gut microecology on Campylobacter presence revealed by comparisons  of the gut microbiota from chickens raised on litter or in individual cages.	BACKGROUND: Poultry is the major reservoir of Campylobacter that contributes to human campylobacteriosis and threatens food safety. Litter contact has been linked to Campylobacter colonization, but the gut microecological impact underlying this link remains not fully clear. Here, we sought to investigate the  impact of the gut microecology on the presence of Campylobacter by examining the  microbiota in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, ceca, and feces from chickens raised  on commercial litter and in individual cages at 0-57 days of age. RESULTS: Through litter contact, the presence of Campylobacter was found to benefit from microecological competition among Lactobacillus, Helicobacter, and genera that are halotolerant and aerobic or facultatively anaerobic in the upper  intestine, such as Corynebacterium and Brachybacterium. The presence was also promoted by the increased abundance in obligate anaerobic fermentation microbes,  especially members of the orders Clostridiales and Bacteroidales. The longitudinal analysis supported the vertical or pseudo-vertical transmission but  suggested that colonization might occur immensely at 7-28 days of age. We observed a host genetic effect on the gut microecology, which might lead to increased heterogeneity of the microecological impact on Campylobacter colonization. CONCLUSIONS: The findings advance the understanding of the gut microecological impact on Campylobacter presence in the chicken gut under conditions of litter contact and suggest that manipulations of the gut microecology, as well as the microbes identified in the Campylobacter association networks, might be important for the development of intervention strategies.	0
34881318	A Novel Fiber-1-Edited and Highly Attenuated Recombinant Serotype 4 Fowl Adenovirus Confers Efficient Protection Against Lethal Challenge.	Currently, a fatal disease of hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome (HHS) caused by serotype 4 fowl adenovirus (FAdV-4) has spread worldwide and resulted in tremendous economic losses to the poultry industry. Various vaccines against FAdV-4 were developed to control the disease; however, few live-attenuated vaccines were available. In this study, we targeted the N-terminal of fiber-1 and rescued a recombinant virus FAdV4-RFP_F1 expressing the fusion protein of RFP and Fiber-1 based on the CRISPR/Cas9 technique. In vitro studies showed that FAdV4-RFP_F1 replicated slower than the wild type FAdV-4, but the peak viral titer of FAdV4-RFP_F1 could still reach 107.0 TCID50/ml with high stability in LMH cells. Animal studies found that FAdV4-RFP_F1 not only was highly attenuated  to the 2-week-old SPF chickens, but could also provide efficient protection against lethal challenge of FAdV-4. All these demonstrate that the recombinant virus FAdV4-RFP_F1 could be as an efficient live-attenuated vaccine candidate for FAdV-4, and the N-terminal of fiber-1 could be as a potential insertion site for  expressing foreign genes to develop FAdV-4-based vaccine.	0
35458529	Complete Genome Characterization of Reticuloendotheliosis Virus Detected in Chickens with Multiple Viral Coinfections.	Reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) is a retroviral pathogen capable of infecting several avian hosts and is associated with immunosuppression, anemia, proventriculitis, neoplasia, and runting-stunting syndrome. Its genome contains the three major genes, gag, pol, and env, and two flanking long terminal repeat (LTR) regions. Complete genome sequences of REV are limited in terms of geographical origin. The aim of this study was to characterize the complete genome of REV detected in Brazilian chickens with multiple viral coinfections and analyze the polymorphisms in the deduced amino acids sequences corresponding to its encoded proteins. We tested the presence and completeness of REV as well as other viral pathogens in samples from Brazilian poultry farms by qPCR. The complete genomes of two REV strains were sequenced by overlapping fragments through the dideoxy method. Phylogenetic analysis, pairwise identity matrix, polymorphism identification and protein modeling were performed along the entire  genome. We detected REV in 65% (26/40) of the tested samples. Concomitant viral infections were detected in 82.5% (33/40) of the samples and in 90% (9/10) of the farms. Multiple infections included up to seven viruses. Phylogenetic analysis classified both Brazilian strains into REV subtype 3, and the pairwise comparison indicated that strains from the USA and fowlpox virus (FWPV)-related strains were the most identical. The subdomain p18 in gag, the reverse transcriptase/ribonuclease H in pol, and the surface (SU) in the env protein were the most polymorphic in genomic comparisons. The relevant motifs for each protein were highly conserved, with fewer polymorphisms in the fusion peptide, immunosuppression domain, and disulfide bonds on the surface (SU) and transmembrane (TM) of env. This is the first study to include complete genomes of REV in Brazil and South America detected in farms with multiple viral coinfections. Our findings suggest an involvement of REV as an immunosuppressor and active agent in the emergence and progression of multiple infectious diseases. We also found a possible etiological relationship between Brazilian strains and the USA and FWPV recombinant strains. This information highlights the need for epidemiological vigilance regarding REV in association with another pathogens.	0
35058965	circTAF8 Regulates Myoblast Development and Associated Carcass Traits in Chicken.	Recent studies have shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in skeletal muscle development. CircRNA biogenesis is dependent on the genetic context. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the introns flanking circRNAs may be  intermediate-inducible factors between circRNA expression and phenotypic traits.  Our previous study showed that circTAF8 is an abundantly and differentially expressed circRNA in leg muscle during chicken embryonic development. Here, we aimed to investigate circTAF8 function in muscle development and the association  of the SNPs in the circTAF8 flanking introns with carcass traits. In this study,  we observed that overexpression of circTAF8 could promote the proliferation of chicken primary myoblasts and inhibit their differentiation. In addition, the SNPs in the introns flanking the circTAF8 locus and those associated with chicken carcass traits were analyzed in 335 partridge chickens. A total of eight SNPs were found associated with carcass traits such as leg muscle weight, live weight, and half and full-bore weight. The association analysis results of haplotype combinations were consistent with the association analysis of a single SNP. These results suggest that circTAF8 plays a regulatory role in muscle development. These identified SNPs were found correlated with traits to muscle development and carcass muscle weight in chickens.	0
34646299	SAP30 Gene Is a Probable Regulator of Muscle Hypertrophy in Chickens.	Animals with muscle hypertrophy phenotype are targeted by the broiler industry to increase the meat production and the quality of the final product. Studies characterizing the molecular machinery involved with these processes, such as quantitative trait loci studies, have been carried out identifying several candidate genes related to this trait; however, validation studies of these candidate genes in cell culture is scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate  SAP30 as a candidate gene for muscle development and to validate its function in  cell culture in vitro. The SAP30 gene was downregulated in C2C12 muscle cell culture using siRNA technology to evaluate its impact on morphometric traits and  gene expression by RNA-seq analysis. Modulation of SAP30 expression increased C2C12 myotube area, indicating a role in muscle hypertrophy. RNA-seq analysis identified several upregulated genes annotated in muscle development in treated cells (SAP30-knockdown), corroborating the role of SAP30 gene in muscle development regulation. Here, we provide experimental evidence of the involvement of SAP30 gene as a regulator of muscle cell hypertrophy.	0
34727889	Genetic variations for the eggshell crystal structure revealed by genome-wide association study in chickens.	BACKGROUND: Eggshell is a bio-ceramic material comprising columnar calcite (CaCO3) crystals and organic proteinaceous matrix. The size, shape and orientation of the CaCO3 crystals influence the microstructural properties of chicken eggshells. However, the genetic architecture underlying eggshell crystal  polymorphism remains to be elucidated. RESULTS: The integral intensity of the nine major diffraction peaks, total integral intensity and degree of orientation of the crystals were measured followed by a genome-wide association study in 839 F2 hens. The results showed that the total integral intensity was positively correlated with the eggshell strength, eggshell thickness, eggshell weight, mammillary layer thickness and effective layer thickness. The SNP-based heritabilities of total integral intensity and degree of orientation were 0.23 and 0.06, respectively. The 621 SNPs located in the range from 55.6 to 69.1 Mb in GGA1 were significantly associated with TA. PLCZ1, ABCC9, ITPR2, KCNJ8, CACNA1C and IAPP, which are involved in the biological process of regulating cytosolic calcium ion concentration, can be suggested as key genes regulating the total integral intensity. CONCLUSIONS: The findings greatly advance the understanding of the genetic basis  underlying the crystal ultrastructure of eggshell quality and thus will have practical significance in breeding programs for improving eggshell quality.	0
35458523	A Recombinant Turkey Herpesvirus Expressing the F Protein of Newcastle Disease Virus Genotype XII Generated by NHEJ-CRISPR/Cas9 and Cre-LoxP Systems Confers Protection against Genotype XII Challenge in Chickens.	In this study, we developed a new recombinant virus rHVT-F using a Turkey herpesvirus (HVT) vector, expressing the fusion (F) protein of the genotype XII Newcastle disease virus (NDV) circulating in Peru. We evaluated the viral shedding and efficacy against the NDV genotype XII challenge in specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. The F protein expression cassette was inserted in the unique long (UL) UL45-UL46 intergenic locus of the HVT genome by utilizing a  clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 gene-editing technology via a non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathway. The rHVT-F virus, which expressed the F protein stably in vitro and in vivo, showed similar growth kinetics to the wild-type HVT (wtHVT) virus. The F protein  expression of the rHVT-F virus was detected by an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), Western blotting, and a flow cytometry assay. The presence of an NDV-specific IgY antibody was detected in serum samples by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in SPF chickens vaccinated with the rHVT-F virus. In  the challenge experiment, the rHVT-F vaccine fully protects a high, and significantly reduced, virus shedding in oral at 5 days post-challenge (dpc). In  conclusion, this new rHVT-F vaccine candidate is capable of fully protecting SPF  chickens against the genotype XII challenge.	0
33447254	A Major QTL for Resistance to Vibrio anguillarum in Rainbow Trout.	Genetic selection of disease resistant fish is a major strategy to improve health, welfare and sustainability in aquaculture. Mapping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the fish genome may be a fruitful tool to define relevant  quantitative trait loci (QTL) and we here show its use for characterization of Vibrio anguillarum resistant rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Fingerlings were exposed to the pathogen V. anguillarum serotype O1 in a solution of 1.5 × 107 cfu/ml and observed for 14 days. Disease signs appeared 3 days post exposure  (dpe) whereafter mortality progressed exponentially until 6 dpe reaching a total  mortality of 55% within 11 days. DNA was sampled from all fish - including survivors - and analyzed on a 57 k Affymetrix SNP platform whereby it was shown that disease resistance was associated with a major QTL on chromosome 21 (Omy 21). Gene expression analyses showed that diseased fish activated genes associated with innate and adaptive immune responses. The possible genes associated with resistance are discussed.	0
35100964	ddRAD-seq reveals the genetic structure and detects signals of selection in Italian brown trout.	BACKGROUND: Brown trout is one of the most widespread fresh-water fish species in Europe. The evolutionary history of and phylogenetic relationships between brown  trout populations are complex, and this is especially true for Italian populations, which are heavily influenced in different ways by stocking practices. The characterization of the genetic structure of Italian brown trout populations may give information on the risk of losing endemic Italian populations due to lack of genetic diversity or to admixture with stocking populations. The identification of signatures of selection, and the information deriving from dense genotyping data will help genotype-informed breeding programs. We used a ddRAD-seq approach to obtain more than 100,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and to characterize the population structure and signatures of selection in 90 brown trout samples. RESULTS: Italian brown trout populations are genetically differentiated, although the stocking practices have introduced strong admixture in endemic Italian trout, especially with the Atlantic lineage. Most of the analysed populations showed high levels of kinship and inbreeding. We detected putative signatures of selection using different approaches, and investigated if the regions were enriched for functional categories. Several regions putatively under selection and characterized by a reduction in heterozygosity across all the studied populations are enriched for genes involved in the response to viral infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our results, which show evidence of admixture with the Atlantic lineage (commonly used for stocking), confirm the need for controlling stocking practices, in order to avoid the erosion of the endemic gene pool; given the apparently high levels of kinship and inbreeding in local populations, our results also show the need to take action for increasing gene diversity. In addition, we used the genetically-distinct lineages to detect signatures of selection and we identified putative signatures of selection in several regions associated with resistance to infectious diseases. These constitute candidate regions for the study of resistance to infections in wild and farmed trout.	0
34524627	Components of metabolic syndrome associated with lower neurocognitive performance in youth with perinatally acquired HIV and youth who are HIV-exposed uninfected.	We investigated the association of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components [abdominal obesity, elevated triglycerides (TG), low HDL cholesterol, elevated blood pressure (BP), and impaired fasting glycemia (IFG)] with neurocognitive impairment in youth with perinatally acquired HIV (YPHIV) or who are perinatally  HIV-exposed uninfected (YPHEU). This was an observational study with a comparison group of 350 YPHIV and 68 YPHEU ages 10-19 years. Youth with MetS components measured between 1 year before and 3 months after a baseline neurocognitive assessment (Wechsler Intelligence Scale) were selected from the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS). A sub-group completed another assessment 3 years later. We assessed the association of each baseline MetS component with five standardized neurocognitive indices at baseline and changes in indices over time. At baseline, 15% of YPHIV and 18% of YPHEU met criteria for ≥ 2 MetS components. Among YPHIV, there was no association between MetS components and neurocognitive indices at baseline; however, over time, elevated baseline BP was  associated with a greater decrease in mean Perceptual Reasoning scores (-4.3;95%CI: -8.8,0.3) and ≥ 2 MetS components with a greater decrease in mean Processing Speed scores (-5.1;95%CI: -9.4, -0.8). Among YPHEU, elevated TG was associated with lower mean Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, and Full-scale IQ scores at baseline, and IFG with lower mean Verbal Comprehension scores. Components of MetS in YPHIV (elevated BP) and YPHEU (elevated TG and IFG) were associated with lower neurocognitive performance index scores. Studies to elucidate how modifying metabolic risk factors early in life may improve neurocognitive outcomes in this population are warranted.	0
34261942	Derivation and Validation of the Critical Bronchiolitis Score for the PICU.	OBJECTIVES: To derive and internally validate a bronchiolitis-specific illness severity score (the Critical Bronchiolitis Score) that out-performs mortality-based illness severity scores (e.g., Pediatric Risk of Mortality) in measuring expected duration of respiratory support and PICU length of stay for critically ill children with bronchiolitis. DESIGN: Retrospective database study using the Virtual Pediatric Systems (VPS, LLC; Los Angeles, CA) database. SETTING: One-hundred twenty-eight North-American PICUs. PATIENTS: Fourteen-thousand four-hundred seven children less than 2 years old admitted to a contributing PICU with primary diagnosis of bronchiolitis and use of ICU-level respiratory support (defined as high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or negative pressure ventilation) at 12 hours after PICU admission. INTERVENTIONS: Patient-level variables available at 12 hours from PICU admission, duration of ICU-level respiratory support, and PICU length of stay data were extracted for analysis. After randomly dividing the cohort into derivation and validation groups, patient-level variables that were significantly associated with the study outcomes were selected in a stepwise backward fashion for inclusion in the final score. Score performance in the validation cohort was assessed using root mean squared error and mean absolute error, and performance was compared with that of existing PICU illness severity scores. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twelve commonly available patient-level variables  were included in the Critical Bronchiolitis Score. Outcomes calculated with the score were similar to actual outcomes in the validation cohort. The Critical Bronchiolitis Score demonstrated a statistically significantly stronger association with duration of ICU-level respiratory support and PICU length of stay than mortality-based scores as measured by root mean squared error and mean  absolute error. CONCLUSIONS: The Critical Bronchiolitis Score performed better than PICU mortality-based scores in measuring expected duration of ICU-level respiratory support and ICU length of stay. This score may have utility to enrich interventional trials and adjust for illness severity in observational studies in this very common PICU condition.	0
33153561	ACR Appropriateness Criteria® Vomiting in Infants.	Vomiting in infants under the age of 3 months is one of the most common reasons for parents to seek care from their doctor or present to an emergency room. The imaging workup that ensues is dependent on several factors: age at onset, days versus weeks after birth, quality of emesis, bilious or nonbilious vomiting, and  the initial findings on plain radiograph, suspected proximal versus distal bowel  obstruction. The purpose of these guidelines is to inform the clinician, based on current evidence, what is the next highest yield and most appropriate imaging study to pursue a diagnosis. The goal is rapid and accurate arrival at a plan for treatment, whether surgical or nonsurgical. The following modalities are discussed for each variant of the symptom: plain radiography, fluoroscopic upper  gastrointestinal series, fluoroscopic contrast enema, ultrasound of the abdomen,  nuclear medicine gastroesophageal reflux scan. The American College of Radiology  Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.	0
34280522	Prognostic Role of Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing in Wild-Type Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy Patients Treated With Tafamidis.	BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in patients with wild-type transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis treated with tafamidis  is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective study included patients with wtATTR who underwent baseline cardiopulmonary exercise testing and were treated with tafamidis from August 31, 2018, until March 31, 2020. Univariate logistic and multivariate cox-regression models were used to predict the occurrence of the primary outcome (composite of mortality, heart transplant, and palliative inotrope initiation). A total of 33 patients were included (median age 82 years,  interquartile range [IQR] 79-84 years), 84% were Caucasians and 79% were males).  Majority of patients had New York Heart Association functional class III disease  at baseline (67%). The baseline median peak oxygen consumption (VO2) and peak circulatory power (CP) were 11.35 mL/kg/min (IQR 8.5-14.2 mL/kg/min) and 1485.8 mm Hg/mL/min (IQR 988-2184 mm Hg/mL/min), respectively, the median ventilatory efficiency was 35.7 (IQR 31-41.2). After 1 year of follow-up, 11 patients experienced a primary end point. Upon multivariate analysis, the low peak VO2 (hazard ratio [HR] 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23-0.79, P = .007], peak  CP (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.98-0.99, P = .02), peak oxygen pulse (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39-0.97, P = .03), and exercise duration of less than 5.5 minutes (HR 5.82, 95% CI 1.29-26.2, P = .02) were significantly associated with the primary outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Tafamidis-treated patients with wtATTR who had baseline low peak VO2, peak CP, peak O2 pulse, and exercise duration of less than 5.5 minutes had worse outcomes.	0
34743109	Neonatal Nurses' Report of Family-Centered Care Resources and Practices.	BACKGROUND: A paucity of studies describes the prevalence of family-centered care (FCC) practices and resources in US neonatal units. PURPOSE: To identify US prevalence of FCC practices and resources and to identify the largest gaps in resource provision. METHODS: Neonatal nurses completed an online survey through national conferences  (eg, NANN educational conference), neonatal organization Web sites (eg, NANN research survey), and social media (eg, NANN and NPA Facebook). Nurses provided demographics and the National Perinatal Association Self-Assessment on Comprehensive Family Support, a 61-item checklist of FCC practices and resources  from 6 categories: family-centered developmental care, staff education/support, peer support, palliative care, discharge education, and mental health support. RESULTS: Nurses (n = 103) reported lowest resources for Peer Support and Mental Health Support. About a third had a neonatal intensive care unit parent advisory  committee (n = 39; 37.9%). Only 43.7% (n = 45) had necessary amenities for families to stay with their infants. Less than a third felt that mental health professionals were adequately staffed to provide counseling to parents (n = 28; 27.5%). Very few nurses had adequate training on providing parents psychological  support (n = 16; 15.8%). More than half (n = 58; 56.3%) stated that all staff receive training in family-centered developmental care. Finally, less than half (n = 42; 40.8%) stated that staff see parents as equal members of the care team. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: We demonstrate a consistent and widespread lack of training provided to neonatal staff in nearly every aspect of comprehensive FCC support. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Researchers need to identify unit/organizational interventions that increase adoption and implementation of FCC practices and resources.	0
34642636	Vitamin K & D Deficiencies Are Independently Associated With COVID-19 Disease Severity.	BACKGROUND: We investigated the association of vitamin K and vitamin D with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. METHODS: Levels of inactive vitamin K-dependent dephosphorylated uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (dp-ucMGP; marker of vitamin K status) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D; vitamin D status) were measured in plasma samples from participants with confirmed acute COVID-19 and were age- and sex-matched to healthy controls.  Unadjusted odds ratios and adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% CIs were computed using cumulative logistic regression. RESULTS: One hundred fifty subjects were included, 100 COVID-19+ and 50 controls. The median age (interquartile range) was 55 (48-63) years, and 50% were females.  Thirty-four percent had mild COVID-19 disease, 51% moderate disease, and 15% severe. Dp-ucMGP levels were higher (ie, worse K status) in COVID-19+ vs controls (776.5 ng/mL vs 549.8 ng/mL; P < .0001) with similar 25(OH)D between groups (25.8 vs 21.9 ng/mL; P = .09). Participants who were vitamin D deficient (<20 ng/mL) had the worse vitamin K status (dp-ucMGP >780 ng/mL) and experienced the most severe COVID-19 outcomes. In adjusted models, every 1-unit increase in the log2 dp-ucMGP nearly doubled the odds of acute critical disease or death (AOR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.01-3.45), and every 1-unit decrease in the natural log 25(OH)D was associated with >3 times the likelihood of severe COVID-19 disease (AOR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11-0.67). CONCLUSIONS: Early in acute COVID-19, both vitamin K and vitamin D deficiency were independently associated with worse COVID-19 disease severity, suggesting a  potential synergistic interplay between these 2 vitamins in COVID-19.	0
34817400	The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Pediatric Graduate Medical Education: Lessons Learned and Pathways Forward.	In this article, the authors describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric graduate medical education (GME), including the impact on clinical experiences for trainees, teaching methods used, trainee wellness, GME leader wellness and support, and the traditional interview process. A thorough literature review was done to identify impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric GME. In addition, information was collected through Association of Pediatric Program Directors virtual cafes and conferences. Positive changes for GME from the COVID-19 pandemic included: the rapid transition to telehealth; asynchronous learning allowing for increased cross-program collaboration; innovative online teaching modalities; increased flexibility and decreased cost of online recruitment; and shared innovations across pediatric GME. Challenging aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic included: decreased learning about common childhood illnesses, such as bronchiolitis, acute otitis media, and influenza; decreased patient volumes and patient complexity in clinics and inpatient wards,  leading to less practice developing efficiency, time management, and triaging skills; and an increased burden on trainees, including moral distress and decreased support from one another and other social supports. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted important opportunities in U.S. educational systems. As  medical educators move forward, it will be important to learn from these while mitigating the negative impacts.	0
35198999	Seasonal changes of electrophysiological heterogeneities in the rainbow trout ventricular myocardium.	INTRODUCTION: Thermal adaptation in fish is accompanied by morphological and electrophysiological changes in the myocardium. Little is known regarding seasonal changes of spatiotemporal organization of ventricular excitation and repolarization processes. We aimed to evaluate transmural and apicobasal heterogeneity of depolarization and repolarization characteristics in the rainbow trout in-situ ventricular myocardium in summer and winter conditions. METHODS: The experiments were done in summer-acclimatized (SA, 18°C, n = 8) and winter-acclimatized (WA, 3°C, n = 8) rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). 24 unipolar electrograms were recorded with 3 plunge needle electrodes (eight lead terminals each) impaled into the ventricular wall. Activation time (AT), end of repolarization time (RT), and activation-repolarization interval (ARI, a surrogate for action potential duration) were determined as dV/dt min during QRS-complex, dV/dt max during T-wave, and RT-AT difference, respectively. RESULTS: The SA fish demonstrated relatively flat apicobasal and transmural AT and ARI profiles. In the WA animals, ATs and ARIs were longer as compared to SA animals (p≤0.001), ARIs were shorter in the compact layer than in the spongy layer (p≤0.050), and within the compact layer, the apical region had shorter ATs  and longer ARIs as compared to the basal region (p≤0.050). In multiple linear regression analysis, ARI duration was associated with RR-interval and AT in SA and WA animals. The WA animals additionally demonstrated an independent association of ARIs with spatial localization across the ventricle. CONCLUSION: Cold conditions led to the spatial redistribution of repolarization durations in the rainbow trout ventricle and the formation of repolarization gradients typically observed in mammalian myocardium.	0
34256705	Long-term monitoring of a brown trout (Salmo trutta) population reveals kin-associated migration patterns and contributions by resident trout to the anadromous run.	BACKGROUND: In species showing partial migration, as is the case for many salmonid fishes, it is important to assess how anthropogenic pressure experienced by migrating individuals affects the total population. We focused on brown trout  (Salmo trutta) from the Guddal River in the Norwegian Hardanger Fjord system, which encompasses both resident and anadromous individuals. Aquaculture has led to increased anthropogenic pressure on brown trout during the marine phase in this region. Fish traps in the Guddal River allow for sampling all ascending anadromous spawners and descending smolts. We analyzed microsatellite DNA markers from all individuals ascending in 2006-2016, along with all emigrating smolts in  2017. We investigated (1) if there was evidence for declines in census numbers and effective population size during that period, (2) if there was association between kinship and migration timing in smolts and anadromous adults, and (3) to  what extent resident trout were parents of outmigrating smolts. RESULTS: Census counts of anadromous spawners showed no evidence for a decline from 2006 to 2016, but were lower than in 2000-2005. Estimates of effective population size also showed no trends of declines during the study period. Sibship reconstruction of the 2017 smolt run showed significant association between kinship and migration timing, and a similar association was indicated in  anadromous spawners. Parentage assignment of 2017 smolts with ascending anadromous trout as candidate parents, and assuming that unknown parents represented resident trout, showed that 70% of smolts had at least one resident parent and 24% had two resident parents. CONCLUSIONS: The results bear evidence of a population that after an initial decline has stabilized at a lower number of anadromous spawners. The significant  association between kinship and migration timing in smolts suggests that specific episodes of elevated mortality in the sea could disproportionally affect some families and reduce overall effective population size. Finally, the results based on parentage assignment demonstrate a strong buffering effect of resident trout in case of elevated marine mortality affecting anadromous trout, but also highlight that increased mortality of anadromous trout, most of which are females, may lower overall production in the system.	0
35013769	Trabecular bone score in people with cystic fibrosis.	People with cystic fibrosis (CF) are at increased risk of fractures. Our study found that low trabecular bone score (TBS) (a measure of bone strength) may help  identify people with CF at risk of fractures especially when combined with bone density measured by DXA, age, hemoglobin A1c, and transplant status.INTRODUCTION: People with cystic fibrosis (CF) are at increased risk of fractures. This study aims to evaluate the association of trabecular bone score (TBS) with fractures in CF. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of adults with CF who completed bone density between 2009 and 2019. TBS was applied to lumbar spine studies. RESULTS: A total of 202 people with CF were included. A history of fracture was present in 36 (17.8%) subjects. Patients with history of fractures had higher hemoglobin A1c (A1C) (7.8 ± 2.7% vs. 6.7 ± 1.7%, p = 0.024), lower femoral neck (FN) Z/T-score (- 1.05 ± 1.08 vs. - 0.44 ± 1.08, p = 0.012), and lower TBS (1.36 ± 0.13 vs. 1.40 ± 0.11, p = 0.05) compared to those without. Lung transplant recipients had a higher prevalence of fractures (50% vs. 14.1%, p < 0.001). The odds ratio (95%CI) of having a fracture for subjects with TBS (≤ 1.2 vs. > 1.2) stratified by FN Z/T-score (≤ - 2.0 or >  - 2.0) was 3.88 (0.92, 16.35), p = 0.07. ROC analysis showed TBS was significantly associated with fractures (p < 0.05); however, FN BMD was superior. A model combining FN BMD, age, A1c, transplant, and TBS improved ROC compared to FN BMD + age (0.837 vs. 0.779, p = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: TBS ≤ 1.2 may identify people with CF at high risk of fractures. A model combining FN BMD, age, A1c, transplant, and TBS was significantly associated with fractures compared to FN BMD + age. Future studies are needed to  evaluate the prediction of fractures in people with CF using clinical and bone parameters.	0
33367062	Phylogenetic association of Cyprinid (Schizothorax) inferred from complete mitochondrial genome.	Whole mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of S.esocinusand S. plagiostomus was found to be  16,591 and 16,564 bp respectively with 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNAs genes, 22 tRNA genes and 2 non-coding region. For valuing the phylogenetic relationship of  a species on the basis of whole mitogenome are considered to be a great importance. In this study, we sequenced whole mitogenome of S.esocinusand S. plagiostomus and compared with the whole mitogenome sequences of members of other families (Balitoridae, Nemanchillidae and Cobatidae). The monophyly of the family Cyprinidae and a clade comprising Balitoridae and Nemanchillidae while Cobatidae  with paraphyletic origin was strongly supported by the resultant phylogenies, recognized that Cyprinidae was closely related with the family Cobatidae than other ones. The results indicated that whole mitochondrial genome has a great importance in studying variation in genes and phylogenetic relationship in the subfamily Schizothoracinae. This data offering the molecular phylogenetic frame work of important Schizothorax species found in Swat.	0
35442240	Differences in Clinical Presentation of Eosinophilic Esophagitis in Pediatric Patients with Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease.	SIGNIFICANCE: Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is an inflammatory condition characterized by T helper-2 (Th2) cytokines. Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's  Disease (CD) are inflammatory conditions with different clinical presentations and immune profiles. UC is associated with Th2 cytokines and CD with Th1 cytokines. We investigated potential differences in the association of EoE with UC and CD because of these different immune profiles. METHODS: We utilized ICD 9 and 10 codes to find patients with inflammatory bowel  disease (IBD) and EoE. We defined EoE as any esophageal biopsy with greater than  15 eosinophils. We collected demographic, clinical, laboratory, endoscopic and histological data. RESULTS: Thirty patients had both EoE and IBD. 14.9% of UC patients had EoE and 5.7% of CD patients had EoE. 64.7% of UC patients presented with UC and EoE at the same time, whereas 76.9% of CD patients presented with EoE at follow up. 10 of 13 CD patients were on anti-TNF at EoE diagnosis. No UC patients were on anti-TNF at EoE diagnosis. 83% of CD patients had mild disease or were in remission, whereas 50% of UC patients had moderate to severe disease at the time  of EoE diagnosis. CONCLUSION: A higher percentage of UC than CD patients had EoE. EoE was more likely to be present at the initial diagnosis of UC than CD. EoE was more likely  after diagnosis and treatment of CD with anti-TNF, when CD activity was mild or in remission. The difference in presentation suggests that anti-TNF or it's impact on inflammation may differentially impact the association of EoE with CD and UC.	0
34471570	Incorporating Acupuncture Into American Healthcare: Initiating a Discussion on Implementation Science, the Status of the Field, and Stakeholder Considerations.	INTRODUCTION: The field of implementation science is the study of methods that promote the uptake of evidence-based interventions into healthcare policy and practice. While acupuncture has gained significant traction in the American healthcare landscape, its journey has been somewhat haphazard and non-linear. METHODS: In June 2019, a group of thirty diverse stakeholders was convened by the Society for Acupuncture Research with the support of a Patient Centered Outcomes  Research Institute, Eugene Washington Engagement Award. This group of stakeholders represented a diverse mix of patients, providers, academicians, researchers, funders, allied health professionals, insurers, association leaders, certification experts, and military program developers. The collective engaged in discussion that explored acupuncture's status in healthcare, including reflections on its safety, effectiveness, best practices, and the actual implementation of acupuncture as seen from diverse stakeholder viewpoints. OBJECTIVES: A primary goal was to consider how to utilize knowledge from the field of implementation science more systematically and intentionally to disseminate information about acupuncture and its research base, through application of methods known to implementation science. The group also considered novel challenges that acupuncture may present to known implementation processes. FINDINGS: This article summarizes the initial findings of this in-person meeting  of stakeholders and the ongoing discussion among the subject matter experts who authored this report. The goal of this report is to catalyze greater conversation about how the field of implementation science might intersect with practice, access, research, and policymaking pertaining to acupuncture. Core concepts of implementation science and its relationship to acupuncture are introduced, and the case for acupuncture as an Evidence Based Practice (EBP) is established. The  status of the field and current environment of acupuncture is examined, and the perspectives of four stakeholder groups--patients, two types of professional practitioners, and researchers--are explored in more detail.	0
33917547	Molecular Mechanisms of Maternal Diabetes Effects on Fetal and Neonatal Surfactant.	Respiratory distress is a significant contributor to newborn morbidity and mortality. An association between infants of diabetic mothers (IDMs) and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) has been well recognized for decades. As obesity and diabetes prevalence have increased over the past several decades, more women are overweight and diabetic in the first trimester, and many more pregnant women are diagnosed with gestational diabetes. Glycemic control during pregnancy can be challenging due to the maternal need for higher caloric intake and higher insulin resistance. Surfactant is a complex molecule at the alveolar air-liquid interface that reduces surface tension. Impaired surfactant synthesis  is the primary etiology of RDS. In vitro cell line studies, in vivo animal studies with diabetic rat offspring, and clinical studies suggest hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia can disrupt surfactant lipid and protein synthesis, causing  delayed maturation in surfactant in IDMs. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for surfactant dysfunction in IDMs may improve clinical strategies to prevent diabetes-related complications and improve neonatal outcomes.	0
34375239	First insight in trace element distribution in the intestinal cytosol of two freshwater fish species challenged with moderate environmental contamination.	Cytosolic distribution of six essential elements and nonessential Cd among biomolecules of different molecular masses was investigated in the intestine of brown trout (Salmo trutta) from the karst Krka River and Prussian carp (Carassius gibelio) from the lowland Ilova River. Fish were sampled at two locations (reference and contaminated) and in two seasons (autumn and spring). Analyses were conducted by size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography and high  resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Although studied salmonid and cyprinid fish have different biological characteristics, obtained profiles often showed mostly similar patterns in both species. Specifically, Cd and Cu were dominantly bound to metallothioneins in both species, but the same association was not observed for Zn, whereas Mo distribution was similar in the intestine of both fish species with two well shaped and clear peaks in HMM (100-400 kDa) and VLMM (2-8 kDa) range. In brown trout, Se was mostly associated  with biomolecules of very low molecular masses (VLMM, <10 kDa), whereas significant additional elution in HMM region (30-303 kDa) was observed only in Prussian carp. Iron binding to VLMM biomolecules (1.8-14 kDa) was observed only in brown trouts, and of Zn in Prussian carps. Cobalt was mostly bound to HMM biomolecules (85-235 kDa) in brown trout and to VLMM biomolecules (0.7-18 kDa) in Prussian carp. Comparison of intestinal profiles with previously published data on liver and gills revealed some similarities in distribution, but also organ-specific differences due to the different function and composition of each  organ. As so far there is no published data on intestinal trace metal distribution, the obtained results represent the novel findings, and the key point for the exact identification of specific metal-binding biomolecules which could eventually be used as biomarkers of metal exposure or effects.	0
33573995	Measuring the impact of CFTR modulation on sweat chloride in cystic fibrosis: Rationale and design of the CHEC-SC study.	BACKGROUND: The Characterizing CFTR Modulated Changes in Sweat Chloride and their Association with Clinical Outcomes (CHEC-SC) study is a large epidemiologic study designed to determine the relationship between sweat chloride response and clinical outcomes in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) on commercially approved CFTR modulators. A challenge to study feasibility was capturing sweat chloride measurements before modulator initiation. We tested the hypothesis that historic  sweat chloride approximated contemporary pre-modulator values to estimate CFTR modulator-induced changes, allowing a single-visit study design. METHODS: GOAL and PROSPECT were multi-center prospective studies of individuals initiating ivacaftor or lumacaftor-ivacaftor. At enrollment, pre-modulator sweat  chloride was measured and historic results recorded. Post-modulator sweat chloride was measured at 1, 3 and 6 months. For this analysis, differences between historic and pre-modulator sweat chloride were estimated. CFTR modulator-induced sweat chloride mean changes were compared using historic and pre-modulator sweat chloride. RESULTS: Paired historic and pre-modulator sweat chloride (n=406 participants) revealed a non-significant mean change of -1.0 mmol/L (95% CI: -2.71, 0.66) over  an average of 17.2 years. Calculating sweat response to ivacaftor or lumacaftor-ivacaftor using historic or pre-modulator values resulted in similar estimates of modulator response. Based on these results, the CHEC-SC study was designed with a single, post-modulator sweat chloride measurement. CONCLUSIONS: Historic sweat chloride values provide a reliable estimate of pre-modulator sweat chloride for people starting on modulator therapy. The CHEC-SC study anticipates capturing approximately 5,000 sweat chloride values, providing an unprecedented understanding of sweat chloride across the CF population in the era of CFTR modulators.	0
33373444	Genomics Links Inflammation With Neurocognitive Impairment in Children Living With Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type-1.	BACKGROUND: We identified host single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) associated with  neurocognitive impairment (NCI) in perinatally HIV-infected (PHIV) children. METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 217 PHIV with cognitive score for age (CSA) < 70 and 247 CSA ≥ 70 (discovery cohort [DC]). SNVs identified in DC were evaluated in 2 validation cohorts (VC). Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for NCI. A human microglia NLRP3  inflammasome assay characterized the role of identified genes. RESULTS: Twenty-nine SNVs in 24 genes reaching P ≤ .002 and OR ≥ 1.5 comparing CSA < 70 to CSA ≥ 70 were identified in the DC, of which 3 SNVs were identified in VCs for further study. Combining the 3 cohorts, SNV in CCRL2 (rs3204849) was associated with decreased odds of NCI (P < .0001); RETREG1/FAM134B (rs61733811) and YWHAH (rs73884247) were associated with increased risk of NCI (P < .0001 and  P < .001, respectively). Knockdown of CCRL2 led to decreased microglial release of IL-1β following exposure to ssRNA40 while knockdown of RETREG1 and YWHAH resulted in increased IL-1β release. CONCLUSIONS: Using WES and 2 VCs, and gene silencing of microglia we identified 3 genetic variants associated with NCI and inflammation in HIV-infected children.	0
34811963	Airway microbiome dynamics and relationship to ventilator-associated infection in intubated pediatric patients.	BACKGROUND: Little is known about the airway microbiome in intubated mechanically ventilated children. We sought to characterize the airway microbiome longitudinally and in association with clinical variables and possible ventilator-associated infection (VAI). METHODS: Serial tracheal aspirate samples were prospectively obtained from mechanically ventilated subjects under 3 years old from eight pediatric intensive care units in the United States from June 2017 to July 2018. Changes in the tracheal microbiome were analyzed by sequencing bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene  relative to subject demographics, diagnoses, clinical parameters, outcomes, antibiotic treatment, and the Ventilator-Associated InfectioN (VAIN) score. RESULTS: A total of 221 samples from 58 patients were processed and 197 samples met the >1000 reads criteria (89%), with an average of 43,000 reads per sample. The median number of samples per subject was 3 (interquartile range [IQR]: 2-5),  with a median VAIN score of 2 (IQR: 1-3). Proteobacteria was the highest observed phyla throughout the intubation period, followed by Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. Alpha diversity was negatively associated with days of intubation (p = .032) and VAIN score (p = .016). High VAIN scores were associated with a decrease of Mycobacterium obuense, and an increase of Streptococcus peroris, Porphyromonadaceae family (unclassified species), Veillonella atypica, and several other taxa. No specific pattern of microbiome composition related to clinically diagnosed VAIs was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate decreasing alpha diversity with increasing VAIN score and days of intubation. No specific microbiome pattern was associated with  clinically diagnosed VAI.	0
35445733	Ribosome assembly factor PNO1 is associated with progression and promotes tumorigenesis in triple‑negative breast cancer.	The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of ribosome assembly factor partner of NOB1 homolog (PNO1) and its association with the progression of breast cancer (BC) in patients, as well as its biological function and underlying mechanism of action in BC cells. Bioinformatics and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that PNO1 expression was significantly increased in BC tissues and its high mRNA expression was associated with shorter  overall survival (OS) and relapse‑free survival (RFS) of patients with BC, as well as multiple clinical characteristics (including advanced stage of NPI and SBR, etc.) of patients with BC. Biological functional studies revealed that transduction of lentivirus encoding sh‑PNO1 significantly downregulated PNO1 expression, reduced cell confluency and the number of BC cells in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PNO1 knockdown decreased the cell viability and arrested cell cycle progression at the G2/M phase, as well as downregulated cyclin B1 (CCNB1) and cyclin‑dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) protein expression in BC cells. Correlation analysis demonstrated that PNO1 expression was positively correlated with both CDK1 and CCNB1 expression in BC samples. Collectively, PNO1 was upregulated in BC and associated with BC patient survival, and PNO1 knockdown suppressed tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. In addition, positive regulation of CCNB1 and CDK1 may be one of the underlying mechanisms.	0
34442736	Comparative Genomic Analyses of Flavobacterium psychrophilum Isolates Reveals New Putative Genetic Determinants of Virulence Traits.	The fish pathogen Flavobacterium psychrophilum is currently one of the main pathogenic bacteria hampering the productivity of salmonid farming worldwide. Although putative virulence determinants have been identified, the genetic basis  for variation in virulence of F. psychrophilum is not fully understood. In this study, we analyzed whole-genome sequences of a collection of 25 F. psychrophilum  isolates from Baltic Sea countries and compared genomic information with a previous determination of their virulence in juvenile rainbow trout. The results  revealed a conserved population of F. psychrophilum that were consistently present across the Baltic Sea countries, with no clear association between genomic repertoire, phylogenomic, or gene distribution and virulence traits. However, analysis of the entire genome of four F. psychrophilum isolates by hybrid assembly provided an unprecedented resolution for discriminating even highly related isolates. The results showed that isolates with different virulence phenotypes harbored genetic variances on a number of consecutive leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins, repetitive motifs in gliding motility-associated protein, and the insertion of transposable elements into intergenic and genic regions. Thus, these findings provide novel insights into the genetic variation of these elements and their putative role in the modulation of F. psychrophilum virulence.	0
34988649	Effect of prior radiation on stage, differentiation, and survival in bladder cancer.	PURPOSE: Clinically significant differences in radiation-related bladder tumors are not well-characterized, and survival analyses are needed. In this study, we aimed to utilize a national cancer database to evaluate the effect of prior radiation on tumor characteristics and survival in bladder cancer patients. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 9 database was queried to identify patients diagnosed with bladder cancer as a second malignancy. Patients having undergone radiation prior to developing bladder cancer were selected for comparative analysis. Logistic regression was used to generate odds ratios to evaluate differences in differentiation, stage, grade, and tumor size. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox non-proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the association between previous radiation and bladder cancer survival. RESULTS: A total of 25,408 patients were identified, of which 14,570 patients had sufficient data for analysis. Of these, 5968 (41.0%) received radiation for their primary malignancy. Prior radiation conferred a lower risk of developing moderately- or poorly-differentiated bladder tumors and muscle invasive or node-positive disease. An increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma was noted (OR 1.43, CI 1.06-1.93). Prior radiation led to an increased risk of bladder cancer-specific (HR 1.13, CI 1.03-1.24) mortality at 5 years. The greatest effect of prior radiation was an increased risk of bladder cancer-specific mortality for carcinoma in situ at 5 years (OR 2.37, CI 1.45-3.86). CONCLUSION: Prior radiation is associated with lower grade and stage of bladder tumors in addition to worse cancer-specific survival.	0
35115629	Cardiac dyspnea risk zones in the South of France identified by geo-pollution trends study.	The incidence of cardiac dyspnea (CD) and the distribution of pollution in the south of France suggests that environmental pollution may have a role in disease  triggering. CD is a hallmark symptom of heart failure leading to reduced ability  to function and engage in activities of daily living. To show the impact of short-term pollution exposure on the increment of CD emergency room visits, we collected pollutants and climate measurements on a daily basis and 43,400 events  of CD in the Région Sud from 2013 to 2018. We used a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) to assess the association between air pollution and CD events. We divided the region in 357 zones to reconciliate environmental and emergency room  visits data. We applied the DLNM on the entire region, on zones grouped by pollution trends and on singular zones. Each pollutant has a significant effect on triggering CD. Depending on the pollutant, we identified four shapes of exposure curves to describe the impact of pollution on CD events: early and late  effect for NO2; U-shape and rainbow-shape (or inverted U) for O3; all the four shapes for PM10. In the biggest cities, O3 has the most significant association along with the PM10. In the west side, a delayed effect triggered by PM10 was found. Zones along the main highway are mostly affected by NO2 pollution with an  increase of the association for a period up to 9 days after the pollution peak. Our results can be used by local authorities to set up specific prevention policies, public alerts that adapt to the different zones and support public health prediction-making. We developed a user-friendly web application called Health, Environment in PACA Region Tool (HEART) to collect our results. HEART will allow citizens, researchers and local authorities to monitor the impact of pollution trends on local public health.	0
34004422	Early changes in neural circuit function engaged by negative emotion and modified by behavioural intervention are associated with depression and problem-solving outcomes: A report from the ENGAGE randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Depression exerts a staggering toll that is worsened with co-occurring chronic conditions such as obesity. It is imperative to develop more effective interventions for depression and to identify objective and biological plausible neural mechanisms to understand intervention outcomes. The current study uses functional neuroimaging to determine whether a behavioural intervention changes the negative affect circuit and whether these changes relate to subsequent improvements in both symptom and problem-solving outcomes in depressed patients with co-occurring obesity. METHODS: This study ('ENGAGE') was a pre-planned element of the randomized controlled trial, 'RAINBOW' (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02246413). 108 depressed patients with obesity were randomized to receive an integrated collaborative care intervention (I-CARE) or usual care. Participants underwent functional neuroimaging using an established facial emotion task at baseline and two months  (coinciding with the first two months of intervention focused on problem-solving  therapy ('PST')). Amygdala, insula and anterior cingulate cortex activation was extracted using pre-planned definitions and standardized methods. The primary health and behavioural outcomes were depression symptom severity and problem-solving ability respectively, assessed at baseline, the main 6-month outcome point and at 12-month follow up. Mediation analyses used an intent-to-treat approach. FINDINGS: PST, relative to usual care, reduced amygdala activation engaged by threat stimuli at two months. This reduction mediated subsequent improvements in  depression severity in an intervention-dependent manner. PST did not change insula activation at two months but did temper the strength of the relationship between insula activation and improvements in problem-solving ability. INTERPRETATION: The negative affect circuit may be an important neural target and potential mediator of PST in patients with comorbid obesity.

34558059	Antimicrobial protein REG3A and signaling networks are predictive of stroke outcomes.	Regenerating Family Member 3 Alpha (REG3A) is a multifunctional protein with antimicrobial activity, and primarily secreted by the intestine and pancreas. Studies have shown an increased expression of REG3A in systemic inflammatory responses to acute injury and infection, but studies investigating REG3A during the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke are limited. The aims of this study were to examine the associations between arterial expression of REG3A and other arterial  inflammatory proteins implicated in stroke pathogenesis, as well as associations  between REG3A and markers of poor outcome for ischemic stroke. The University of  Kentucky Blood and Clot Thrombectomy Registry and Collaboration (BACTRAC) protocol (clinicaltrials.gov NCT03153683) utilizes thrombectomy to isolate intracranial arterial blood (i.e. distal to thrombus) and systemic arterial blood (i.e. carotid). Samples were analyzed by Olink Proteomics for N = 42 subjects. Statistical analyses of plasma proteins included 2-sample t-tests, spearman and biserial correlations, and robust regression models to elucidate network signaling and association to clinical outcomes. Results indicated that levels of  systemic REG3A were positively correlated with inflammatory proteins interleukin  IL6 (R = 0.344, p = 0.030) and IL17C (R = 0.468, p = 0.002). 2-sided t- tests examining differences of systemic REG3A within quartiles of NIHSS admission score depicted significant differences between quartiles. Those with NIHSS scores corresponding to moderate and moderate-severe neurofunctional deficits had significantly higher levels of systemic REG3A compared to those with NIHSS scores corresponding to mild and mild-moderate neurofunctional deficits (p = 0.016). STRING analyses of proteins in each robust regression model demonstrated substantial networking between REG3A and other systemic proteins highly relevant  to ischemic stroke. The present study provides novel data on systemic REG3A in the context of ischemic stroke. These results demonstrate the influential role of REG3A regarding surrogate functional and radiographic outcomes of stroke severity. Additionally, they provide novel insight into the role of REG3A and related proteins during the complex neuroinflammatory process of ischemic stroke. These data provide a foundation for future studies to investigate REG3A and related networking proteins as potential biomarkers with prognostic potential, as well as potential therapeutic targets.	0
34583137	Impedance-based measures of muscle mass can be used to predict severity of hepatic steatosis in pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.	OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate the association between measures of body composition based on bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and histologic severity of liver disease in a pediatric cohort with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of patients < 20 y old with histologically confirmed NAFLD followed in our Steatohepatitis Center from 2017 to 2019. Contemporaneous body-composition data were obtained using a multifrequency octopolar BIA device (InBody 370, InBody, Seoul, South Korea). BIA data collected were skeletal muscle mass, appendicular muscle mass, and percentage body fat. Skeletal and appendicular muscle mass were corrected for height (dividing by the square of height), generating their respective indices. Univariate linear and logistic regression, followed by multivariable logistic regression analyses, were used. RESULTS: Of the 79 children included (27% female, 73% male; 38% Hispanic; median  age, 13 y; median body mass index Z-score, 2.43), the median NAFLD Activity Score was 4 (interquartile range, 3-5). In multivariable regression analyses, the skeletal muscle mass index was negatively associated with hepatic steatosis after controlling for confounders (odds ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.62-0.93). Similarly, the appendicular muscle mass index was negatively associated with severity of hepatic steatosis severity (odds ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.90). In contrast, percentage body fat was not associated with hepatic steatosis. NAFLD Activity Score, lobular inflammation, ballooning scores, and fibrosis stage were not associated with measures of body composition. CONCLUSIONS: There is an inverse association between BIA-based measures of muscle mass and severity of hepatic steatosis in children with NAFLD. BIA data could further inform clinical decision making in this context.	0
33919455	Gait Speed as a Predictor for Diabetes Incidence in People with or at Risk of Knee Osteoarthritis: A Longitudinal Analysis from the Osteoarthritis Initiative.	BACKGROUND: This study examined the association between baseline gait speed with  incident diabetes mellitus (DM) among people with or at elevated risk for knee OA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants from the Osteoarthritis Initiative, aged 45 to 79 years, where included. Participants with or at risk of knee OA from baseline to the 96-month visit were included. Participants with self-reported DM  at baseline were excluded. DM incidence was followed over the 4-time points. Gait speed was measured at baseline using a 20-m walk test. Generalized estimating equations with logistic regression were utilized for analyses. Receiver operator  characteristic curves and area under the curve were used to determine the cutoff  score for baseline speed. RESULTS: Of the 4313 participants included in the analyses (58.7% females), 301 participants had a cumulative incidence of DM of 7.0% during follow-up. Decreased gait speed was a significant predictor of incident DM (RR 0.44, p = 0.018). The threshold for baseline gait speed that predicted incident DM was 1.32 m/s with an area under the curve of 0.59 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Baseline gait speed could be an important screening tool for identifying people at risk of incident diabetes, and the determined cutoff value  for gait speed should be examined in future research.	0
35405344	Transactional sex, HIV and health among young cisgender men and transgender women who have sex with men in Thailand.	"PURPOSE: To examine how recent sex work is identified and the HIV risk factors and service needs among Thai cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) who exchange sex. METHODS: MSM and TGW in Bangkok and Pattaya who exchanged sex in the last year (n= 890) were recruited through social media, outreach, and word-of-mouth. Recent sex exchange was based on the primary question, ""in the last 30 days, have you sold or traded sex""; secondary questions (regarding income source and client encounters) were also investigated. RESULTS: Overall, 436 (48%) participants engaged in sex work in the last 30 days; among those, 270 (62%) reported exchanging sex by the primary question, and 160 (37%) based on secondary questions only. Recent sex exchange was associated with  gonorrhea, syphilis, discussing PrEP with others, and using condoms, alcohol, methamphetamine, amyl nitrate, and Viagra®. Exchanging sex based on secondary questions only was associated with being in a relationship, social media recruitment, less recent anal intercourse, and not discussing PrEP. CONCLUSIONS: Thai MSM and TGW who exchange sex need regular access to HIV/STI prevention, testing, and treatment services, and multiple approaches to assessing sex work will help identify and serve this diverse and dynamic population."	0
33692832	Genetic Parameters and Genome-Wide Association Studies of Quality Traits Characterised Using Imaging Technologies in Rainbow Trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss.	One of the top priorities of the aquaculture industry is the genetic improvement  of economically important traits in fish, such as those related to processing and quality. However, the accuracy of genetic evaluations has been hindered by a lack of data on such traits from a sufficiently large population of animals. The objectives of this study were thus threefold: (i) to estimate genetic parameters  of growth-, yield-, and quality-related traits in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) using three different phenotyping technologies [invasive and non-invasive: microwave-based, digital image analysis, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)], (ii) to detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with these traits, and (iii) to identify candidate genes present within these QTL regions. Our study collected data from 1,379 fish on growth, yield-related traits (body weight, condition coefficient, head yield, carcass yield, headless gutted carcass yield), and quality-related traits (total fat, percentage of fat in subcutaneous adipose tissue, percentage of fat in flesh, flesh colour); genotypic data were then obtained for all fish using the 57K SNP Axiom® Trout Genotyping array. Heritability estimates for most of the 14 traits examined were moderate to strong, varying from 0.12 to 0.67. Most traits were clearly polygenic, but our genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identified two genomic regions on chromosome 8 that explained up to 10% of the genetic variance (cumulative effects of two QTLs) for several traits (weight, condition coefficient, subcutaneous and  total fat content, carcass and headless gutted carcass yields). For flesh colour  traits, six QTLs explained 1-4% of the genetic variance. Within these regions, we identified several genes (htr1, gnpat, ephx1, bcmo1, and cyp2x) that have been implicated in adipogenesis or carotenoid metabolism, and thus represent good candidates for further functional validation. Finally, of the three techniques used for phenotyping, MRI demonstrated particular promise for measurements of fat content and distribution, while the digital image analysis-based approach was very useful in quantifying colour-related traits. This work provides new insights that may aid the development of commercial breeding programmes in rainbow trout,  specifically with regard to the genetic improvement of yield and flesh-quality traits as well as the use of invasive and/or non-invasive technologies to predict such traits.	0
34828902	Correlation of Mercury Occurrence with Age, Elemental Composition, and Life History in Sea-Run Food Fish from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago's Lower Northwest Passage.	As mercury emissions continue and climate-mediated permafrost thaw increases the  burden of this contaminant in northern waters, Inuit from a Northwest passage community in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago pressed for an assessment of their subsistence catches. Sea-run salmonids (n = 537) comprising Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), lake trout (S. namaycush), lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), and cisco (C. autumnalis, C. sardinella) were analyzed for muscle  mercury. Methylmercury is a neurotoxin and bioaccumulated with fish age, but other factors including selenium and other elements, diet and trophic level as assessed by stable isotopes of nitrogen (δ15N) and carbon (δ13C), as well as growth rate, condition, and geographic origin, also contributed depending on the  species, even though all the fish shared a similar anadromous or sea-run life history. Although mean mercury concentrations for most of the species were ~0.09  µg·g-1 wet weight (ww), below the levels described in several jurisdictions for subsistence fisheries (0.2 µg·g-1 ww), 70% of lake trout were above this guideline (0.35 µg·g-1 ww), and 19% exceeded the 2.5-fold higher levels for commercial sale. We thus urge the development of consumption advisories for lake  trout for the protection of pregnant women and young children and that additionally, periodic community-based monitoring be initiated.	0
34367556	Balancing selection, genetic drift, and human-mediated introgression interplay to shape MHC (functional) diversity in Mediterranean brown trout.	The extraordinary polymorphism of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes is considered a paradigm of pathogen-mediated balancing selection, although empirical evidence is still scarce. Furthermore, the relative contribution of balancing selection to shape MHC population structure and diversity, compared to  that of neutral forces, as well as its interaction with other evolutionary processes such as hybridization, remains largely unclear. To investigate these issues, we analyzed adaptive (MHC-DAB gene) and neutral (11 microsatellite loci)  variation in 156 brown trout (Salmo trutta complex) from six wild populations in  central Italy exposed to introgression from domestic hatchery lineages (assessed  with the LDH gene). MHC diversity and structuring correlated with those at microsatellites, indicating the substantial role of neutral forces. However, individuals carrying locally rare MHC alleles/supertypes were in better body condition (a proxy of individual fitness/parasite load) regardless of the zygosity status and degree of sequence dissimilarity of MHC, hence supporting balancing selection under rare allele advantage, but not heterozygote advantage or divergent allele advantage. The association between specific MHC supertypes and body condition confirmed in part this finding. Across populations, MHC allelic richness increased with increasing admixture between native and domestic  lineages, indicating introgression as a source of MHC variation. Furthermore, introgression across populations appeared more pronounced for MHC than microsatellites, possibly because initially rare MHC variants are expected to introgress more readily under rare allele advantage. Providing evidence for the complex interplay among neutral evolutionary forces, balancing selection, and human-mediated introgression in shaping the pattern of MHC (functional) variation, our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the evolution of  MHC genes in wild populations exposed to anthropogenic disturbance.	0
34101788	Platform Trials to Expedite Drug Development in Alzheimer's Disease: A Report from the EU/US CTAD Task Force.	A diverse range of platforms has been established to increase the efficiency and  speed of clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD). These platforms enable parallel assessment of multiple therapeutics, treatment regimens, or participant  groups; use uniform protocols and outcome measures; and may allow treatment arms  to be added or dropped based on interim analyses of outcomes. The EU/US CTAD Task Force discussed the lessons learned from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU) platform trial and the challenges addressed by other platform trials that have launched or are in the planning stages. The landscape of clinical trial platforms in the AD space includes those testing experimental therapies such as DIAN-TU, platforms designed to test multidomain interventions, and those designed to streamline trial recruitment by building trial-ready cohorts. The heterogeneity of the AD patient population, AD drugs, treatment regimens, and analytical methods complicates the design and execution of platform trials, yet Task Force members concluded that platform trials are essential to advance the search for effective AD treatments, including combination therapies.	0
35289663	Abdominal CT and MRI Findings of Portal Hypertension in Children and Adults with  Fontan Circulation.	Background Portal hypertension in the Fontan circulation is a function of elevated systemic venous pressure and liver fibrosis. Purpose To quantify the prevalence of radiologic evidence of portal hypertension and elevated VAST score  (one point each for varices, ascites, splenomegaly, and thrombocytopenia) of 2 or greater in children and adults with Fontan circulation and to determine the association with hemodynamics and adverse outcomes. Materials and Methods This was a retrospective study of individuals with Fontan circulation who underwent abdominal MRI or CT for focal liver lesion surveillance between January 2012 and  December 2019. Portal hypertension was defined as the presence of at least two of the following: varices, ascites, or splenomegaly. Fontan deterioration was defined as a composite of heart failure signs or symptoms requiring diuretic escalation, placement of a ventricular assist device, heart transplant, or death. Relationships between variables and the composite end point were assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Results A total of 123 patients (age range, 9-55 years; 32 children) were evaluated (median age, 23 years; IQR, 17-30 years; 63 male patients). Median time since diagnosis of Fontan circulation was 16 years (IQR, 12-23 years). Twenty-five of the 123 patients (20%) had radiologic evidence of portal hypertension, and 34 (28%) had a VAST score of 2 or greater. Fontan deterioration occurred in 25 of the 123 patients (20%); median follow-up duration was 0.4 year (IQR, 0.1-3.1 years). Compared with patients who had Fontan circulation without deterioration, patients with Fontan deterioration were more likely to have moderate or severe ventricular systolic dysfunction (P < .01), moderate or severe atrioventricular valve regurgitation (P < .01), higher Fontan pressure (P = .01), radiologic evidence of portal hypertension (P < .01), and VAST score of 2 or greater (P < .01). Conclusion Radiologic evidence of portal hypertension at abdominal imaging in children and adults with Fontan circulation was associated with higher venous pressures and an increased risk for Fontan deterioration. These characteristics may be used to identify patients who warrant comprehensive hemodynamic evaluation. © RSNA, 2022.	0
33402707	Outcomes of infants with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn: results from three NICHD studies.	"OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) with death or disability among infants with moderate or severe hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) treated with therapeutic hypothermia. METHODS: We compared infants with and without PPHN enrolled in the hypothermia arm from three randomized controlled trials (RCTs): Induced Hypothermia trial, ""usual care"" arm of Optimizing Cooling trial, and Late Hypothermia trial. Primary outcome was death or disability at 18-22 months adjusted for severity of HIE, center, and RCT. RESULTS: Among 280 infants, 67 (24%) were diagnosed with PPHN. Among infants with and without PPHN, death or disability was 47% vs. 29% (adjusted OR: 1.65, 0.86-3.14) and death was 26% vs. 12% (adjusted OR: 2.04, 0.92-4.53), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PPHN in infants with moderate or severe HIE was not associated with  a statistically significant increase in primary outcome. These results should be  interpreted with caution given the limited sample size."	0
33302601	Identification of Arctic Food Fish Species for Anthropogenic Contaminant Testing  Using Geography and Genetics.	The identification of food fish bearing anthropogenic contaminants is one of many priorities for Indigenous peoples living in the Arctic. Mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), and persistent organic pollutants including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are of concern, and these are reported, in some cases for the first time,  for fish sampled in and around King William Island, located in Nunavut, Canada. More than 500 salmonids, comprising Arctic char, lake trout, lake whitefish, and  ciscoes, were assayed for contaminants. The studied species are anadromous, migrating to the ocean to feed in the summers and returning to freshwater before  sea ice formation in the autumn. Assessments of muscle Hg levels in salmonids from fishing sites on King William Island showed generally higher levels than from mainland sites, with mean concentrations generally below guidelines, except  for lake trout. In contrast, mainland fish showed higher means for As, including  non-toxic arsenobetaine, than island fish. Lake trout were highest in As and PCB  levels, with salmonid PCB congener analysis showing signatures consistent with the legacy of cold-war distant early warning stations. After DNA-profiling, only  4-32 Arctic char single nucleotide polymorphisms were needed for successful population assignment. These results support our objective to demonstrate that genomic tools could facilitate efficient and cost-effective cluster assignment for contaminant analysis during ocean residency. We further suggest that routine  pollutant testing during the current period of dramatic climate change would be helpful to safeguard the wellbeing of Inuit who depend on these fish as a staple  input to their diet. Moreover, this strategy should be applicable elsewhere.	0
33199247	Three-Year Outcomes With a Contemporary Self-Expanding Transcatheter Valve From the Evolut PRO US Clinical Study.	BACKGROUND: Paravalvular regurgitation (PVR) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. PVR continues to plague TAVR jeopardizing long-term results. New device iterations, such as the self-expandable Evolut PRO valve, aim to decrease PVR while maintaining optimal hemodynamics. This study sought to evaluate clinical and hemodynamic performance of the Evolut PRO system at 3 years. METHODS: The Evolut PRO US Clinical Study included 60 patients at high or extreme surgical risk undergoing TAVR with the Evolut PRO valve at 8 centers in the United States. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-2 criteria and included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, disabling stroke and valve complications. An independent core laboratory centrally assessed all echocardiographic measures. RESULTS: At 3 years, all-cause mortality was 25.8% (cardiovascular mortality 16.5%) and the disabling stroke rate was 10.7%. There were no cases of repeat valve intervention, endocarditis or coronary obstruction. Valve thrombosis was identified in 1 patient 2 years post-procedure and was treated medically. Hemodynamics at 3 years included a mean gradient of 7.2 ± 4.5 mm Hg, an effective orifice area of 2.0 ± 0.5 cm2, and 88.2% of patients had no or trace PVR. The remaining patients had mild PVR. Most of the surviving patients (80.6%) had New York Heart Association class I symptoms at 3 years. CONCLUSION: Outcomes at 3-years following TAVR with a contemporary self-expanding prosthesis are favorable, with no signal of valve deterioration, excellent hemodynamics including very low prevalence of PVR.	0
33946270	Interactions between Rainbow Trout Eyed Eggs and Flavobacterium spp. Using a Bath Challenge Model: Preliminary Evaluation of Bacteriophages as Pathogen Control Agents.	The microbial community surrounding fish eyed eggs can harbor pathogenic bacteria. In this study we focused on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) eyed eggs and the potential of bacteriophages against the pathogenic bacteria Flavobacterium psychrophilum and F. columnare. An infection bath method was first established, and the effects of singular phages on fish eggs was assessed (survival of eyed eggs, interaction of phages with eyed eggs). Subsequently, bacteria-challenged eyed eggs were exposed to phages to evaluate their effects in controlling the bacterial population. Culture-based methods were used to enumerate the number of bacteria and/or phages associated with eyed eggs and in the surrounding environment. The results of the study showed that, with our infection model, it was possible to re-isolate F. psychrophilum associated with eyed eggs after the infection procedure, without affecting the survival of the eggs in the short term. However, this was not possible for F. columnare, as this  bacterium grows at higher temperatures than the ones recommended for incubation of rainbow trout eyed eggs. Bacteriophages do not appear to negatively affect the survival of rainbow trout eyed eggs and they do not seem to strongly adhere to the surface of eyed eggs either. Finally, the results demonstrated a strong potential for short term (24 h) phage control of F. psychrophilum. However, further studies are needed to explore if phage control can be maintained for a longer period and to further elucidate the mechanisms of interactions between Flavobacteria and their phages in association with fish eggs.	0
34087760	Transcriptomic analysis reveals a Piscirickettsia salmonis-induced early inflammatory response in rainbow trout skeletal muscle.	Skeletal muscle is the most abundant tissue in teleosts and is essential for movement and metabolism. Recently, it has been described that skeletal muscle can express and secrete immune-related molecules during pathogen infection. However,  the role of this tissue during infection is poorly understood. To determine the immunocompetence of fish skeletal muscle, juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were challenged with Piscirickettsia salmonis strain LF-89. P. salmonis is the etiological agent of piscirickettsiosis, a severe disease that has caused  major economic losses in the aquaculture industry. This gram-negative bacterium produces a chronic systemic infection that involves several organs and tissues in salmonids. Using high-throughput RNA-seq, we found that 60 transcripts were upregulated in skeletal muscle, mostly associated with inflammatory response and  positive regulation of interleukin-8 production. Conversely, 141 transcripts were downregulated in association with muscle filament sliding and actin filament-based movement. To validate these results, we performed in vitro experiments using rainbow trout myotubes. In myotubes coincubated with P. salmonis strain LF-89 at an MOI of 50, we found increased expression of the proinflammatory cytokine il1b and the pattern recognition receptor tlr5s 8 and 12 h after infection. These results demonstrated that fish skeletal muscle is an  immunologically active organ that can implement an early immunological response against P. salmonis.	0
34246716	Why is elevation of serum cholesterol associated with exposure to perfluoroalkyl  substances (PFAS) in humans? A workshop report on potential mechanisms.	Serum concentrations of cholesterol are positively correlated with exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) in humans. The associated change in cholesterol is small across a broad range of exposure to PFOA and PFOS. Animal studies generally have not indicated a mechanism that would account for the association in humans. The extent to which the relationship is causal is an open question. Nonetheless, the association is of particular importance because increased serum cholesterol has been considered as an endpoint to derive a point of departure in at least one recent risk assessment. To gain insight into potential mechanisms for the association, both causal and non-causal, an expert workshop was held Oct 31 and Nov 1, 2019 to discuss relevant data and propose new studies. In this report, we summarize the relevant  background data, the discussion among the attendees, and their recommendations for further research.	0
34438856	RNA-Seq-Based Analysis of Cortisol-Induced Differential Gene Expression Associated with Piscirickettsia salmonis Infection in Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) Myotubes.	Salmonid rickettsial septicemia (SRS) is the major infectious disease of the Chilean salmonid aquaculture industry caused by Piscirickettsia salmonis. Intensive farming conditions generate stress and increased susceptibility to diseases, being skeletal muscle mainly affected. However, the interplay between pathogen infection and stress in muscle is poorly understood. In this study, we perform an RNA-seq analysis on rainbow trout myotubes that are pretreated for 3 h with cortisol (100 ng/mL) and then infected with P. salmonis strain LF-89 for 8 h (MOI 50). Twelve libraries are constructed from RNA samples (n = 3 per group) and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 4000. A total of 704,979,454 high-quality reads are obtained, with 70.25% mapped against the reference genome. In silico DETs include 175 total genes-124 are upregulated and 51 are downregulated. GO enrichment analysis reveals highly impacted biological processes related to apoptosis, negative regulation of cell proliferation, and innate immune response. These results are validated by RT-qPCR of nine candidate transcripts. Furthermore, cortisol pretreatment significantly stimulated bacterial gene expression of ahpC  and 23s compared to infection. In conclusion, for the first time, we describe a transcriptomic response of trout myotubes infected with P. salmonis by inducing apoptosis, downregulating cell proliferation, and intrinsic immune-like response  that is differentially regulated by cortisol.	0
34607936	Explanatory Diagnoses Following Hospitalization for a Brief Resolved Unexplained  Event.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Most young infants presenting to the emergency department (ED) with a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) are hospitalized.  We sought to determine the rate of explanatory diagnosis after hospitalization for a BRUE. METHODS: This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study of infants hospitalized with a BRUE after an ED visit between October 1, 2015, and September 30, 2018. We included infants without an explanatory diagnosis at admission. We determined the proportion of patients with an explanatory diagnosis at the time of hospital discharge and whether diagnostic testing, consultation, or observed events occurring during hospitalization were associated with identification of an explanatory diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 980 infants hospitalized after an ED visit for a BRUE without an explanatory diagnosis at admission, 363 (37.0%) had an explanatory diagnosis identified during hospitalization. In 805 (82.1%) infants, diagnostic testing, specialty consultations, and observed events did not contribute to an explanatory diagnosis, and, in 175 (17.9%) infants, they contributed to the explanatory diagnosis (7.0%, 10.0%, and 7.0%, respectively). A total of 15 infants had a serious diagnosis (4.1% of explanatory diagnoses; 1.5% of all infants hospitalized with a BRUE), the most common being seizure and infantile spasms, occurring in 4 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Most infants hospitalized with a BRUE did not receive an explanation during the hospitalization, and a majority of diagnoses were benign or self-limited conditions. More research is needed to identify which infants with a BRUE are most likely to benefit from hospitalization for determining the etiology of the event.	0
33623926	Resources and Costs Associated With Repeated Admissions to PICUs.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the costs and hospital resource use from all PICU patients readmitted with a PICU stay within 12 months of hospital index discharge. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, retrospective cohort study using Pediatric Health Information System. SETTING: Fifty-two tertiary children's hospitals. SUBJECTS: Pediatric patients under 18 years old admitted to the PICU from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patient characteristics and costs of care were compared between those with readmission requiring PICU care and those with only a single PICU admission per annum. In this 2-year cohort, there were 239,157 index  PICU patients of which 36,970 (15.5%) were readmitted and required PICU care during the 12 months following index admission. The total hospital cost for all index admissions and readmissions was $17.3 billion, of which 21.5% ($3.71 billion) were incurred during a readmission stay involving care in the PICU; of the 3,459,079 hospital days, 20.3% (702,200) were readmission days including those where PICU care was required. Of the readmitted patients, 11,703 (30.0%) received only PICU care, accounting for $662 million in costs and 110,215 PICU days. Although 43.6% of all costs were associated with patients who required readmission, these patients only accounted for 15.5% of the index patients and 28% of index hospitalization expenditures. More patients in the readmitted group  had chronic complex conditions at index discharge compared with those not readmitted (83.9% vs 54.9%; p < 0.001). Compared with those discharged directly to home without home healthcare, patients discharged to a skilled nursing facility had 18% lower odds of readmission (odds ratio 0.82 [95% CI, 0.75-0.89];  p < 0.001) and those discharged home with home healthcare had 43% higher odds of  readmission (odds ratio, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.36-1.51]; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Repeated admissions with PICU care resulted in significant direct medical costs and resource use for U.S. children's hospitals.	0
34739432	The Impact of Unplanned Return to the Operating Room on Health-related Quality of Life at the End of Growth-friendly Surgical Treatment for Early-onset Scoliosis.	BACKGROUND: Limiting complications, especially unplanned return to the operating  room (UPROR), is a major focus in the surgical management of early-onset scoliosis (EOS). Although UPROR remains common in this population, its effect on  long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL) remains unclear. The purpose of  this study was to investigate the association between UPROR and end-of-treatment  HRQoL in EOS patients treated with growth-friendly instrumentation. METHODS: Patients with EOS who underwent growth-friendly instrumentation at age less than 10 years from 1993 to 2018, and completed treatment, were identified in a multicenter EOS registry. UPROR events were recorded, and end-of-treatment (defined as skeletal maturity and/or definitive spinal fusion) HRQoL was assessed via the 24-item Early-Onset Scoliosis Questionnaire (EOSQ-24). RESULTS: A total of 825 patients were identified, and 325 patients (age at surgery: 6.4 y, follow-up: 8.1 y) had end-of-treatment HRQoL data necessary for our investigation. Overall, 129/325 (39.7%) patients experienced 264 UPROR events; the majority (54.2%) were implant-related. Aside from age and etiology, no other variables were determined to be confounders or effect modifiers. Congenital patients with UPROR had worse pain/discomfort by 10.4 points (P=0.057) and worse pulmonary function by 7.8 points (P=0.102) compared with non-UPROR patients adjusting for age. Neuromuscular patients with UPROR had worse pulmonary function by 10.1 points compared with non-UPROR patients adjusting for age (P=0.037). Idiopathic and syndromic patients with UPROR reported consistently worse domain scores than their non-UPROR counterparts, but smaller (<5-point) differences were seen. CONCLUSIONS: UPROR during growth-friendly surgical treatment for EOS is associated with worse HRQoL in all patients, but particularly in those with neuromuscular or congenital etiologies. Ongoing efforts to avoid UPROR are critical. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II. This is a multicenter retrospective cohort study investigating the effect of UPROR on HRQoL (prognostic study).	0
34321259	Subcutaneous fat necrosis in an infant with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy stage 3: an uncommon association.	Subcutaneous fat necrosis (SCFN) is inflammation and necrosis of adipose tissue associated with hypoxia and hypothermia. It leads to various metabolic abnormalities, of which the most dreaded is hypercalcaemia. We report a case of a 7-week-old boy with history of birth asphyxia (hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy stage 3) who presented to us with features suggestive of hypercalcaemia with bilateral nephrocalcinosis. On examination, there were multiple subcutaneous nodules on both arms. Evaluation revealed suppressed parathyroid activity along with low levels of 25(OH)vitamin D3 and elevated 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 Skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of SCFN. He was managed with intravenous fluids, single dose of intravenous furosemide and oral prednisolone. Hypercalcaemia responded within 14 days of admission, prednisolone was tapered and stopped in a  month. SCFN, in our case, can be attributed to the underlying perinatal asphyxia  along with use of therapeutic hypothermia. Through this case, we wish to sensitise practicing neonatologists for the need of screening and early identification of these abnormalities, which if missed can be fatal.	0
34500482	Complicated Intubations are Associated with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia in Very Low Birth Weight Infants.	OBJECTIVE:  This study aimed to evaluate the association between desaturation <60% (severe desaturation) during intubation and a total number of intubation attempts in the first week of life in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants with adverse long-term outcomes including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and severe  periventricular/intraventricular hemorrhage grade 3 or 4 (PIVH). STUDY DESIGN:  A retrospective chart review was performed on VLBW infants intubated in the neonatal intensive care unit during the first week of life between January 2017 and July 2020. Descriptive tables were generated for two outcomes including BPD and PIVH. Multivariable logistic regression was performed  for each outcome including significant predictors that differed between groups with a p-value of <0.2. RESULTS:  A total of 146 patients were included. Patients with BPD or PIVH had a  lower gestational age, and patients with BPD had a lower BW. Patients with BPD had a greater number of intubation attempts in the first week of life (4 vs. 3, p < 0.001). In multivariable logistic regression controlling for confounding variables, the odds developing BPD were higher for patients with increased cumulative number of intubation attempts in the first week of life (odds ratio [OR]: 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.62, p = 0.029). Post hoc analyses revealed increased odds of developing BPD with increased number of intubation encounters in the first week of life (OR: 2.20, 95% CI: 1.04-4.82, p = 0.043). In this post hoc analysis including intubation encounters in the model; desaturation <60% during intubation in the first week of life was associated with increased odds of developing BPD (OR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.02-5.63, p = 0.048). CONCLUSION:  The odds of developing BPD for VLBW infants were higher with increased intubation attempts and intubation encounters. In a post hoc analysis,  the odds of developing BPD were also higher with desaturation during intubation.  Further research is needed to determine mechanisms of the relationship between complicated intubations and the development of BPD. KEY POINTS: · Neonatal intubations often require multiple attempts.. · Neonates frequently desaturate during intubation.. · Intubation attempts are positively associated with BPD.. · Severe desaturation may be positively associated with BPD..	0
35132433	Association of Maternal Tdap Recommendations With Pertussis Hospitalizations of Young Infants.	BACKGROUND: It is well established that young infants have the highest risk of severe pertussis, which often results in hospitalization. Since the 2012 recommendation of administering tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, and acellular  pertussis (Tdap) vaccine for every pregnancy, evaluation of pertussis hospitalizations among young infants in the United States has been limited. METHODS: In this ecological study, we used the Kids' Inpatient Database, the largest all-payer pediatric inpatient database in the United States, to study pertussis hospitalizations among infants <1 month of age from 2000 to 2016. RESULTS: The overall rate of pertussis hospitalizations before the Tdap vaccination recommendation was 5.06 per 100 000 infants (95% confidence interval, 4.36-5.76) and 2.15 per 100 000 infants (95% confidence interval, 1.49-2.81) afterward. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports maternal vaccination against pertussis as an important strategy in protecting young infants, and continued evaluation is needed to assess the long-term trends in hospitalization.	0
34089869	Functional identification of ergothioneine transporter in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).	(2S)-3-(2-sulfanylidene-1,3-dihydroimidazol-4-yl)-2-(trimethylazaniumyl)propanoat e (ergothioneine, ET) is hydrophilic antioxidant produced only by certain low-level organisms, but has been reported in the organs of some animals upon dietary intake, facilitated by the ergothioneine transporter (ETT). In this study, it was hypothesised that ETT is involved in the uptake of ET from diet in  salmonids. The mechanism of ET uptake was evaluated through knockdown of candidate gene encoding ETT in a cell line (RTG-2) from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). ETT gene expression in blood cells and certain tissues from rainbow trout was also investigated as ET from the diet is expected to be carried over to the muscle. Knockdown of an ETT candidate (E1) in RTG-2 cells resulted in a remarkable decrease in E1 mRNA expression; uptake of ET was lower in the knocked group than in the control group suggesting that E1 functions as an ETT for rainbow trout. Furthermore, the expression of ETT gene in different tissues including the muscle points to ET uptake from the diet to the muscle of salmonids. In conclusion, this study partly reveals the possible pathway underlying ET uptake from the diet and its deposition in the muscle of edible fish species.	0
34123562	Dermoscopic Predictors of Tumor Thickness in Cutaneous Melanoma: A Retrospective  Analysis of 245 Melanomas.	INTRODUCTION: The literature regarding the association of dermoscopic structures  with Breslow thickness in melanoma is scarce, limited to small case series, and mostly outdated. OBJECTIVE: This study determined the dermoscopic patterns, colors and structures  that are associated with melanoma in situ, thin melanomas (<0.8 mm) and thick melanomas potentially requiring sentinel lymph node biopsy according to current guidelines (≥0.8 mm). METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of 245 dermoscopic images of primary cutaneous melanoma located on the trunk or limbs was performed by consensus of 2  dermoscopists. RESULTS: Red-pink, blue-gray and white color, blue-white veil, shiny white streaks, irregular vessels, blue-black pigmentation, milky red areas, pseudolacunae, ulceration and rainbow pattern were associated with thickness ≥0.8 mm, whereas atypical pigmented network, regression and hypopigmented areas were significantly associated with early melanomas. LIMITATIONS: This is a retrospective study performed in a single institution. Melanomas of special sites were excluded from our evaluation. Dermoscopy is based on subjective evaluations that depend largely on the observers' experience. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of certain dermoscopic structures and colors might help in the discrimination between thin and thick melanomas.	0
33516179	Genomic predictions for fillet yield and firmness in rainbow trout using reduced-density SNP panels.	BACKGROUND: One of the most important goals for the rainbow trout aquaculture industry is to improve fillet yield and fillet quality. Previously, we showed that a 50 K transcribed-SNP chip can be used to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with fillet yield and fillet firmness. In this study, data from  1568 fish genotyped for the 50 K transcribed-SNP chip and ~ 774 fish phenotyped for fillet yield and fillet firmness were used in a single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) model to compute the genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV). In addition, pedigree-based best linear unbiased prediction (PBLUP) was used to calculate traditional, family-based estimated breeding values (EBV). RESULTS: The genomic predictions outperformed the traditional EBV by 35% for fillet yield and 42% for fillet firmness. The predictive ability for fillet yield and fillet firmness was 0.19-0.20 with PBLUP, and 0.27 with ssGBLUP. Additionally, reducing SNP panel densities indicated that using 500-800 SNPs in genomic predictions still provides predictive abilities higher than PBLUP. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that genomic evaluation is a feasible strategy  to identify and select fish with superior genetic merit within rainbow trout families, even with low-density SNP panels.	0
35339929	Cumulative risk, infant sleep, and infant social-emotional development.	The effect of cumulative biological, psychosocial, and demographic risk and infant sleep on infant social-emotional functioning in 12-month-old infants (46%  female) was examined in data from racially (30% Black, 60% White, 10% multiracial/other) and socioeconomically (41% below median income) diverse caregivers (N = 468, M = 30.42 years old, SD = 5.65) recruited from two midwestern states in 2019-2020. Due to the major changes in sleep patterns during infancy and the reported association between sleep and social-emotional functioning, this study also examined whether sleep moderates the association between risk and infant social-emotional functioning and potentially promotes healthy social-emotional functioning despite risk. Greater cumulative risk was associated with poorer sleep efficiency and more social-emotional problems, but was not associated with the general acquisition of social-emotional milestones. Results also suggested that poorer sleep efficiency was associated with more social-emotional problems and poorer social-emotional milestone acquisition. No significant interaction effects were found between cumulative risk and infant sleep. Risk and sleep appear to have unique associations with infant social-emotional problems and development; thus both could be targeted in early intervention to promote social-emotional functioning during infancy and early childhood.	0
35447632	School Closures in the United States and Severe Respiratory Illnesses in Children: A Normalized Nationwide Sample.	"OBJECTIVES: To determine the association between nationwide school closures and prevalence of common admission diagnoses in the pediatric critical care unit. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: National database evaluation using the Virtual Pediatric Systems LLC database. PATIENTS: All patients admitted to the PICU in 81 contributing hospitals in the United States. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Diagnosis categories were determined for all 110,418 patients admitted during the 20-week study period in each year (2018, 2019, and 2020). Admission data were normalized relative to statewide school closure dates for each patient using geographic data. The ""before school closure"" epoch was defined as 8 weeks prior to school closure, and the ""after school closure"" epoch was defined as 12 weeks following school closure. For each diagnosis, admission ratios for each study day were calculated by dividing 2020 admissions by 2018-2019 admissions. The 10 most common diagnosis categories were  examined. Significant changes in admission ratios were identified for bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and asthma. These changes occurred at 2, 8, and 35 days following school closure, respectively. PICU admissions decreased by 82% for bronchiolitis, 76% for pneumonia, and 76% for asthma. Nonrespiratory diseases such as diabetic ketoacidosis, status epilepticus, traumatic injury, and poisoning/ingestion did not show significant changes following school closure. CONCLUSIONS: School closures are associated with a dramatic reduction in the prevalence of severe respiratory disease requiring PICU admission. School closure may be an effective tool to mitigate future pandemics but should be balanced with potential academic, economic, mental health, and social consequences."	0
35211792	Association of early hyponatremia and the development of acute kidney injury in critically ill children.	BACKGROUND: Hyponatremia is an independent prognostic factor for mortality; however, the reason for this remains unclear. An observed relationship between hyponatremia and the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) has been reported in certain disease states, but hyponatremia has not been evaluated as a predictor of AKI in critically ill patients or children. METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective cohort study of critically ill children admitted to a tertiary care center. We performed regression analysis to  assess the association between hyponatremia at ICU admission and the development  of new or worsening stage 2 or 3 (severe) AKI on days 2-3 following ICU admission. RESULTS: Among the 5057 children included in the study, early hyponatremia was present in 13.3% of children. Severe AKI occurred in 9.2% of children with hyponatremia compared to 4.5% of children with normonatremia. Following covariate adjustment, hyponatremia at ICU admission was associated with a 75% increase in the odds of developing severe AKI when compared to critically ill children with normonatremia (aOR 1.75, 95% CI 1.28-2.39). Evaluating sodium levels continuously, for every 1 mEq/L decrease in serum sodium level, there was a 0.05% increase in the odds of developing severe AKI (aOR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.08). Hyponatremic children who developed severe AKI had a higher frequency of kidney replacement therapy, AKI or acute kidney disease at hospital discharge, and hospital mortality when compared to those without. CONCLUSIONS: Hyponatremia at ICU admission is associated with the development of  new or worsening AKI in critically ill children. A higher resolution version of the Graphical abstract is available as Supplementary information.	0
34568922	A candidate chromosome inversion in Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) identified  by population genetic analysis techniques.	"The ""genomics era"" has allowed questions to be asked about genome organization and genome architecture of non-model species at a rate not previously seen. Analyses of these genome-wide datasets have documented many examples of novel structural variants (SVs) such as chromosomal inversions, copy number variants, and chromosomal translocations, many of which have been linked to adaptation. The salmonids are a taxonomic group with abundant genome-wide datasets due to their importance in aquaculture and fisheries. However, the number of documented SVs in salmonids is surprisingly low and is most likely due to removing loci in high linkage disequilibrium when analyzing structure and gene flow. Here we re-analyze RAD-seq data from several populations of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) and document a novel ∼1.2 MB SV at the distal end of LG12. This variant contains 15 protein-coding genes connected to a wide-range of functions including cell adhesion and signal transduction. Interestingly, we studied the frequency of this polymorphism in four disjointed populations of charr-one each from Nunavut, Newfoundland, Eastern Russia, and Scotland-and found evidence of the variant only in Nunavut, Canada, suggesting the polymorphism is novel and recently evolved."	0
35429847	Micronutrients in tinnitus: A National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey analysis.	PURPOSE: Micronutrients and their supplementation have been investigated in the development, severity, and treatment of tinnitus. This study aimed to evaluate associations between tinnitus parameters and levels of zinc, manganese, and vitamin B12. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2012 and 2015-2016 participants aged 20-69 who  answered whether they had symptoms of tinnitus in the past year. Persons with tinnitus symptoms further reported how regularly they had symptoms and how disruptive symptoms were. Multivariable regressions accounting for age, gender, and race/ethnicity were used to evaluate the influence of low serum/blood levels  of zinc, manganese, and vitamin B12 on tinnitus presence, regularity, and disruptiveness. RESULTS: This study included 9439 participants, with 16.2% of the sample reporting tinnitus symptoms. In multivariable regression models, low blood manganese was associated with tinnitus regularity (proportional OR: 1.47 [95% CI: 1.06, 2.05], p = 0.0213) and tinnitus disruptiveness (proportional OR: 1.78 [95%  CI: 1.08, 2.96], p = 0.0250), but not tinnitus presence (p = 0.4813). Low serum zinc and low serum vitamin B12 did not have statistically significant associations with analyzed tinnitus parameters. CONCLUSIONS: A nationally representative analysis found that low blood manganese  was significantly associated with tinnitus regularity and disruptiveness, but found that serum zinc and vitamin B12 had no association with tinnitus parameters. These findings suggest that low micronutrient levels are unlikely to  be contributors to tinnitus; however, the results suggest further research on manganese supplementation in patients with tinnitus may be merited.	0
34168167	Genome-scale comparative analysis for host resistance against sea lice between Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout.	Sea lice (Caligus rogercresseyi) is an ectoparasite which causes major production losses in the salmon aquaculture industry worldwide. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are two of the most susceptible salmonid species to sea lice infestation. The objectives of this study were to: (1) identify genomic regions associated with resistance to Caligus rogercresseyi  in Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout by performing single-step Genome-Wide Association studies (ssGWAS), and (2) identify candidate genes related to trait variation based on exploring orthologous genes within the associated regions across species. A total of 2626 Atlantic salmon and 2643 rainbow trout were challenged and genotyped with 50 K and 57 K SNP panels, respectively. We ran two  independent ssGWAS for sea lice resistance on each species and identified 7 and 13 regions explaining more than 1% of the genetic variance for the trait, with the most important regions explaining 3% and 2.7% for Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout, respectively. We identified genes associated with immune response, cytoskeleton function, and cell migration when focusing on important genomic regions for each species. Moreover, we found 15 common orthogroups which were present in more than one associated genomic region, within- or between-species; however, only one orthogroup showed a clear potential biological relevance in the response against sea lice. For instance, dual-specificity protein phosphatase 10-like (dusp10) and dual-specificity protein phosphatase 8 (dusp8) were found in genomic regions associated with lice density in Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout, respectively. Dusp10 and dusp8 are modulators of the MAPK pathway and might be involved in the differences of the inflammation response between lice resistant and susceptible fish from both species. Our results provide further knowledge on candidate genes related to sea lice resistance and may help establish better control for sea lice in fish populations.	0
33432095	Metabarcoding profiling of microbial diversity associated with trout fish farming.	Earthy and musty off-flavors are routinely observed in farmed trout worldwide. The microbial association to the production of those off-flavors was previously reported. The current manuscript aimed to catalog the microbial enrichment (eukaryotes and prokaryotes) in semi-intensive aquaculture freshwater sources that might influence the trout aquaculture quality production. The 16S rRNA and ITS metabarcoding analyses were applied on the inflow- and pond-water samples from trout farms previously recorded a malodor fish products and located alongside Moosach and Sempt Rivers in Bavaria province, Germany. The results showed that more than 99% of the detected prokaryotic OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Unit identification) were bacteria as of ~ 75.57% were Proteobacteria, and ~ 14.4% were Bacteroidetes. Meanwhile, 118 out of 233 of the eukaryotic OTUs  were known species. Of these, ~ 45% were plant pathogens, and ~ 28% were mushroom/yeasts. Based on the comparative analysis between inflow- and pond-water samples, several pro- and eukaryotic microorganisms that affect the trout aquaculture water quality and industry have been detected, including the malodor-producing microorganisms, e.g., Cyanobacteria and Actinobacteria, along with fish infectious microorganisms, e.g., Chilodonella cyprinid, Metschnikowia bicuspidate. Additionally, the effect of the human- and industrial-related activities around the sampling area on the microbiota of the investigated farms were highlighted.	0
35119438	2022 Society of Critical Care Medicine Clinical Practice Guidelines on Prevention and Management of Pain, Agitation, Neuromuscular Blockade, and Delirium in Critically Ill Pediatric Patients With Consideration of the ICU Environment and Early Mobility.	"RATIONALE: A guideline that both evaluates current practice and provides recommendations to address sedation, pain, and delirium management with regard for neuromuscular blockade and withdrawal is not currently available. OBJECTIVE: To develop comprehensive clinical practice guidelines for critically ill infants and children, with specific attention to seven domains of care including pain, sedation/agitation, iatrogenic withdrawal, neuromuscular blockade, delirium, PICU environment, and early mobility. DESIGN: The Society of Critical Care Medicine Pediatric Pain, Agitation, Neuromuscular Blockade, and Delirium in critically ill pediatric patients with consideration of the PICU Environment and Early Mobility Guideline Taskforce was  comprised of 29 national experts who collaborated from 2009 to 2021 via teleconference and/or e-mail at least monthly for planning, literature review, and guideline development, revision, and approval. The full taskforce gathered annually in-person during the Society of Critical Care Medicine Congress for progress reports and further strategizing with the final face-to-face meeting occurring in February 2020. Throughout this process, the Society of Critical Care Medicine standard operating procedures Manual for Guidelines development was adhered to. METHODS: Taskforce content experts separated into subgroups addressing pain/analgesia, sedation, tolerance/iatrogenic withdrawal, neuromuscular blockade, delirium, PICU environment (family presence and sleep hygiene), and early mobility. Subgroups created descriptive and actionable Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome questions. An experienced medical information specialist developed search strategies to identify relevant literature between January 1990 and January 2020. Subgroups reviewed literature,  determined quality of evidence, and formulated recommendations classified as ""strong"" with ""we recommend"" or ""conditional"" with ""we suggest."" Good practice statements were used when indirect evidence supported benefit with no or minimal  risk. Evidence gaps were noted. Initial recommendations were reviewed by each subgroup and revised as deemed necessary prior to being disseminated for voting by the full taskforce. Individuals who had an overt or potential conflict of interest abstained from relevant votes. Expert opinion alone was not used in substitution for a lack of evidence. RESULTS: The Pediatric Pain, Agitation, Neuromuscular Blockade, and Delirium in critically ill pediatric patients with consideration of the PICU Environment and  Early Mobility taskforce issued 44 recommendations (14 strong and 30 conditional) and five good practice statements. CONCLUSIONS: The current guidelines represent a comprehensive list of practical clinical recommendations for the assessment, prevention, and management of key aspects for the comprehensive critical care of infants and children. Main areas of focus included 1) need for the routine monitoring of pain, agitation, withdrawal, and delirium using validated tools, 2) enhanced use of protocolized sedation and analgesia, and 3) recognition of the importance of nonpharmacologic  interventions for enhancing patient comfort and comprehensive care provision."	0
35307535	Association between hamstring coactivation during isokinetic quadriceps strength  testing and knee cartilage worsening over 24 months.	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine longitudinal associations, including sex-specific differences, between greater knee flexor antagonist coactivation and worsening cartilage morphology in knees with or at risk for osteoarthritis (OA). DESIGN: Baseline measurements were collected at the 60-month visit of a longitudinal osteoarthritis study following community-dwelling participants (MOST). Knee flexor and extensor muscle activity were measured with surface electromyography during a maximal isokinetic knee extension task. MRI analyzed knee cartilage morphology at baseline and 24-month follow-up. Multivariable adjusted logistic regression models were used to assess associations between coactivation level and cartilage morphology worsening. RESULTS: Analysis of 373 women (mean ± SD age 67.4 ± 7.3 years and BMI 29.7 ± 5.0 kg/m2) and 240 men (66.5 ± 7.8 years and 29.9 ± 4.5 kg/m2) revealed that women had greater medial (P < 0.001), lateral (P < 0.001), and combined (P < 0.001) hamstring coactivation than men. In both sexes, combined hamstring coactivation was associated with patellofemoral cartilage morphology worsening [1.23 (1.02, 1.49)] and to a less significant degree with whole knee cartilage morphology worsening [1.21 (0.98, 1.49)]. In men, greater combined hamstring coactivation was associated with increased risk for whole knee [1.59 (1.06, 2.39)] and patellofemoral [1.38 (1.01, 1.88)] cartilage morphology worsening and  point estimates suggested association between medial hamstring coactivation and medial tibiofemoral cartilage morphology worsening. No significant associations were detected between greater hamstring coactivation and cartilage morphology worsening in women. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a longitudinal relationship between antagonist hamstring coactivation during isokinetic knee extensor testing and worsening of cartilage morphology over 24 months in men with or at risk for knee  OA.	0
35090002	Gut dysfunction markers are associated with body composition in youth living with perinatally acquired HIV.	BACKGROUND: The association between gut dysfunction and body fat composition in youth living with perinatal HIV infection (YPHIV) has not been investigated. METHODS: We included YPHIV aged 7-19 years from the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study Adolescent Master Protocol with plasma available within 6 months of baseline whole-body dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and HIV RNA ≤1,000 copies/mL within 3 months of baseline DXA and a second DXA 2 years later. Plasma  markers of bacterial translocation and gut barrier dysfunction [lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), zonulin, and intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP)] were measured at baseline by ELISA and log-10 transformed. Adiposity outcomes included percent total body, truncal and extremity fat in kg from DXA. Linear regression models were fit using generalized estimating equations to assess associations of baseline gut markers (log10) on adiposity outcomes at baseline and 2 years, adjusted for demographic variables, current ART exposure, and physical activity. RESULTS: 261 youth were included; 128 had a second DXA. Median (Q1, Q3) age at first DXA was 12 years (10, 14), 49% were female, and 69% Black. After adjustment for potential confounders, log10LBP was positively associated with percent total  body fat at baseline (β=4.08, p<0.01) and zonulin with adiposity measures at both time points (range β= 0.94 and 6.50, p≤0.01). I-FABP was inversely associated with percent total body fat at baseline and year 2 (β= -2.36 and -3.01, respectively, p≤0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Despite viral suppression, gut damage and the resultant bacterial translocation are associated with body composition measures in YPHIV.	0
33980605	Associations of Microvascular Complications With the Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in Type 1 Diabetes.	OBJECTIVE: We examined whether the presence of microvascular complications was associated with increased subsequent risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants with type 1 diabetes in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC) study followed for >35 years. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Standardized longitudinal data collection included:  1) stereoscopic seven-field retinal fundus photography centrally graded for retinopathy stage and clinically significant macular edema; 2) urinary albumin excretion rate (AER) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); 3) cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) reflex testing; and 4) adjudicated CVD  events, including death from CVD, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, subclinical myocardial infarction on electrocardiogram, confirmed angina, or coronary artery revascularization. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the association of microvascular complications with subsequent risk of CVD. RESULTS: A total of 239 participants developed CVD, including 120 participants who suffered major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death. The presence of  microvascular disease (diabetic retinopathy, kidney disease, or CAN) was associated with increased risk of subsequent CVD and MACE (hazard ratios 1.86 to  3.18 and 2.09 to 3.63, respectively), associations that remained significant after adjusting for age and HbA1c. After adjustment for traditional CVD risk factors, however, only sustained AER ≥30 mg/24 h occurring alone and/or with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and the presence of both retinal and kidney disease remained associated with CVD. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced microvascular disease, especially moderate to severe albuminuria or eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, conveyed an increased risk of subsequent  cardiovascular disease in the DCCT/EDIC cohort.	0
35368705	Whole-Genome Resequencing to Evaluate Life History Variation in Anadromous Migration of Oncorhynchus mykiss.	Anadromous fish experience physiological modifications necessary to migrate between vastly different freshwater and marine environments, but some species such as Oncorhynchus mykiss demonstrate variation in life history strategies with some individuals remaining exclusively resident in freshwater, whereas others undergo anadromous migration. Because there is limited understanding of genes involved in this life history variation across populations of this species, we evaluated the genomic difference between known anadromous (n = 39) and resident (n = 78) Oncorhynchus mykiss collected from the Klickitat River, WA, USA, with whole-genome resequencing methods. Sequencing of these collections yielded 5.64 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms that were tested for significant differences between resident and anadromous groups along with previously identified candidate gene regions. Although a few regions of the genome were marginally significant, there was one region on chromosome Omy12 that provided the most consistent signal of association with anadromy near two annotated genes  in the reference assembly: COP9 signalosome complex subunit 6 (CSN6) and NACHT, LRR, and PYD domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3). Previously identified candidate genes for anadromy within the inversion region of chromosome Omy05 in coastal steelhead and rainbow trout were not informative for this population as shown in  previous studies. Results indicate that the significant region on chromosome Omy12 may represent a minor effect gene for male anadromy and suggests that this  life history variation in Oncorhynchus mykiss is more strongly driven by other mechanisms related to environmental rearing such as epigenetic modification, gene expression, and phenotypic plasticity. Further studies into regulatory mechanisms of this trait are needed to understand drivers of anadromy in populations of this protected species.	0
33649353	A pilot study of cystic fibrosis exacerbation response phenotypes reveals contrasting serum and sputum iron trends.	The cystic fibrosis (CF) community seeks to explain heterogeneous outcomes of pulmonary exacerbation (PEX) treatment. Serum and sputum inflammatory mediators may identify people with CF (PwCF) at risk for suboptimal responses. However, lack of an established association between response phenotypes and these mediators limits clinical application. In this pilot study, we prospectively characterized treatment response phenotypes by assessing health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) during PEX. We also measured lung function and iron-related biochemical parameters in serum and sputum. We classified subjects as sustained symptom-responders (SRs) or non-sustained symptom-responders (NSRs)  based on the absence or presence, respectively, of worsened symptom scores after  initial improvement. We used linear mixed models (LMMs) to determine whether trends in lung function, hematologic, serum, and sputum indices of inflammation differed between response cohorts. In 20 PwCF, we identified 10 SRs and 10 NSRs with no significant differences in lung function at PEX onset and treatment durations. SRs had better model-predicted trends in lung function than NSRs during PEX. Non-linear trends in serum and sputum iron levels significantly differed between SRs and NSRs. In adults with cystic fibrosis, PEX treatment response phenotypes may be correlated with distinctive trends in serum and sputum iron concentrations.	0
34183363	Accuracy of Diagnostic Codes for Identifying Brief Resolved Unexplained Events.	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) coding strategies for the identification of patients with a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE). METHODS: Multicenter retrospective cohort study, including patients aged <1 year  with an emergency department (ED) visit between October 1, 2015, and September 30, 2018, and an ICD-10 code for the following: (1) BRUE; (2) characteristics of  BRUE; (3) serious underlying diagnoses presenting as a BRUE; and (4) nonserious diagnoses presenting as a BRUE. Sixteen algorithms were developed by using various combinations of these 4 groups of ICD-10 codes. Manual chart review was used to assess the performance of these ICD-10 algorithms for the identification  of (1) patients presenting to an ED who met the American Academy of Pediatrics clinical definition for a BRUE and (2) the subset of these patients discharged from the ED or hospital without an explanation for the BRUE. RESULTS: Of 4512 records reviewed, 1646 (36.5%) of these patients met the American Academy of Pediatrics criteria for BRUE on ED presentation, 1016 (61.7%) were hospitalized, and 959 (58.3%) had no explanation on discharge. Among ED discharges, the BRUE ICD-10 code alone was optimal for case ascertainment (sensitivity: 89.8% to 92.8%; positive predictive value: 51.7% to 72.0%). For hospitalized patients, ICD-10 codes related to the clinical characteristics of BRUE are preferred (specificity 93.2%, positive predictive value 32.7% to 46.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The BRUE ICD-10 code and/or the diagnostic codes for the characteristics of BRUE are recommended, but the choice between approaches depends on the investigative purpose and the specific BRUE population and setting of interest.	0
34156159	Tracheostomy and long-term mechanical ventilation in children after veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.	OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to characterize the incidence of tracheostomy placement and of new requirement for long-term mechanical ventilation after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) among children with acute respiratory  failure. We examine whether an association exists between demographics, pre-ECMO  and ECMO clinical factors, and the placement of a tracheostomy or need for long-term mechanical ventilation. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted at 10 quaternary  care pediatric academic centers, including children supported with veno-venous (V-V) ECMO from 2011 to 2016. RESULTS: Among 202 patients, 136 (67%) survived to ICU discharge. All tracheostomies were placed after ECMO decannulation, in 22 patients, with 19 of those surviving to ICU discharge (14% of survivors). Twelve patients (9% of survivors) were discharged on long-term mechanical ventilation. Tracheostomy placement and discharge on home ventilation were not associated with pre-ECMO severity of illness or pre-existing chronic illness. Patients who received a tracheostomy were older and weighed more than patients who did not receive a tracheostomy, although this association did not exist among patients discharged on home ventilation. ECMO duration was longer in those who received a tracheostomy compared with those who did not, as well as for those discharged on  home ventilation, compared to those who were not. CONCLUSION: The 14% rate for tracheostomy placement and 9% rate for discharge on  long-term mechanical ventilation after V-V ECMO are important patient-centered findings. This study informs anticipatory guidance provided to families of patients requiring prolonged respiratory ECMO support, and lays the foundation for future research.	0
34585212	Aducanumab: Appropriate Use Recommendations.	Aducanumab has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinicians require guidance on the appropriate use of this new therapy. An Expert Panel was assembled to construct Appropriate Use Recommendations based on the participant populations, conduct of the pivotal trials of aducanumab, updated Prescribing Information, and expert consensus. Aducanumab is an amyloid-targeting monoclonal antibody delivered by monthly intravenous infusions. The pivotal trials included patients with early AD (mild cognitive impairment due to AD and mild AD dementia) who had confirmed brain amyloid using amyloid positron tomography. The Expert Panel recommends that use of aducanumab be restricted to this population in which efficacy and safety have  been studied. Aducanumab is titrated to a dose of 10 mg/kg over a 6-month period. The Expert Panel recommends that the aducanumab be titrated to the highest dose to maximize the opportunity for efficacy. Aducanumab can substantially increase the incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) with brain effusion or hemorrhage. Dose interruption or treatment discontinuation is recommended for  symptomatic ARIA and for moderate-severe ARIA. The Expert Panel recommends MRIs prior to initiating therapy, during the titration of the drug, and at any time the patient has symptoms suggestive of ARIA. Recommendations are made for measures less cumbersome than those used in trials for the assessment of effectiveness in the practice setting. The Expert Panel emphasized the critical importance of engaging in a process of patient-centered informed decision-making  that includes comprehensive discussions and clear communication with the patient  and care partner regarding the requirements for therapy, the expected outcome of  therapy, potential risks and side effects, and the required safety monitoring, as well as uncertainties regarding individual responses and benefits.	0
34794597	ACR Appropriateness Criteria® Parathyroid Adenoma.	Hyperparathyroidism is defined as excessive parathyroid hormone production. The diagnosis is made through biochemical testing, in which imaging has no role. However, imaging is appropriate for preoperative parathyroid gland localization with the intent of surgical cure. Imaging is particularly useful in the setting of primary hyperparathyroidism whereby accurate localization of a single parathyroid adenoma can facilitate minimally invasive parathyroidectomy. Imaging  can also be useful to localize ectopic or supernumerary parathyroid glands and detail anatomy, which may impact surgery. This document summarizes the literature and provides imaging recommendations for hyperparathyroidism including primary hyperparathyroidism, recurrent or persistent primary hyperparathyroidism after parathyroid surgery, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Recommendations include ultrasound, CT neck without and with contrast, and nuclear medicine parathyroid scans. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.	0
33880928	Hepatic Steatosis in Patients With Single Ventricle and a Fontan Circulation.	Background Hepatic steatosis, caused by nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, is a leading cause of chronic liver disease. The interplay between hepatic steatosis and the development of liver disease following the Fontan procedure is not well understood. This study examined the prevalence and associations of hepatic steatosis in patients with a Fontan circulation. Methods and Results This was a single-center retrospective study of 95 patients with a Fontan circulation with liver magnetic resonance imaging performed between 2012 and 2019. The average age at magnetic resonance imaging was 21.5±8.5 years. The percent liver fat signal was determined using magnetic resonance chemical shift-encoded proton density fat fraction imaging. Hepatic steatosis was defined as liver fat ≥5% and was present  in 10.5% of the cohort. The presence of hepatic steatosis was associated with higher body mass index (29±4 versus 24±6 kg/m2, P=0.006), a higher frequency of obesity (50% versus 12%, P=0.015), lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (35±9 versus 43±14 mg/dL, P=0.050), and greater subcutaneous fat thickness (2.6±0.7 versus 1.8±1.0 cm, P=0.043). There was no association between hepatic steatosis and cardiovascular imaging or hemodynamic variables from cardiac catheterization. Conclusions Risk factors for hepatic steatosis in patients with  Fontan circulation include obesity and dyslipidemia, similar to what is seen in the general population. Fontan hemodynamics were not associated with hepatic steatosis.	0
35075436	Bell's palsy following COVID-19 vaccine administration in HIV+ patient.	"PURPOSE: COVID-19 immunizations are novel and there is widespread public concern  for the lack of data on their potential adverse effects. Cases of Bell's palsy following COVID-19 vaccination were reported disproportionately in the vaccine group during phase 3 clinical trials and have now been reported multiple times post-licensure. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has stated the frequency of Bell's palsy in the vaccine group is consistent with the expected background rate of Bell's palsy in the population but recommends ""surveillance for cases of Bell's palsy with deployment of the vaccine into larger populations.""1 Here we present a case of Bell's palsy following Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine administration in an HIV+ patient as a potential adverse event following  immunization. OBSERVATIONS: A 60-year-old male with HIV presented to the emergency department for evaluation of left facial droop. He had received the first dose of Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccination approximately 42 hours prior to symptom onset. Physical examination in the ED revealed left-sided facial weakness with involvement of the forehead, inability to raise left eyebrow, and inability to close left eye with sensation and strength intact in bilateral upper and lower extremities. Physical examination in our outpatient ophthalmology clinic on day 2 following symptom onset was revealing for mild exposure keratopathy, 5 mm lagophthalmos and very poor Bell's reflex in the left eye with otherwise normal exam findings. These findings were judged to be consistent with uncomplicated Bell's palsy. He was provided ophthalmic lubricating ointment to use hourly, artificial tears as needed, moisture goggles and suggested to tape eyelids nightly in addition to standard systemic glucocorticoid and antiviral therapy. The patient's facial weakness and exposure keratopathy were completely resolved at approximately 90 days following symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: Though there is insufficient evidence at this time to support any causal association between COVID-19 vaccines and Bell's palsy, the temporal relationship between vaccination and classic clinical features of Bell's palsy in our patient certainly raises suspicion for association with Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination. It will be important to monitor for cases of Bell's palsy following COVID-19 immunization as an increasing percentage of the global population receives vaccination."	0
34638176	Molecular insights into the role of genetic determinants of congenital hypothyroidism.	In our previous studies, we have demonstrated the association of certain variants of the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), thyroid peroxidase (TPO), and thyroglobulin (TG) genes with congenital hypothyroidism. Herein, we explored the  mechanistic basis for this association using different in silico tools. The mRNA  3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) plays key roles in gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In TSHR variants (rs2268477, rs7144481, and rs17630128), the binding affinity of microRNAs (miRs) (hsa-miR-154-5p, hsa-miR-376a-2-5p, hsa-miR-3935, hsa-miR-4280, and hsa-miR-6858-3p) to the 3'-UTR is disrupted, affecting post-transcriptional gene regulation. TPO and TG are the  two key proteins necessary for the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones in the presence of iodide and H2O2. Reduced stability of these proteins leads to aberrant biosynthesis of thyroid hormones. Compared to the wild-type TPO protein, the p.S398T variant was found to exhibit less stability and significant rearrangements of intra-atomic bonds affecting the stoichiometry and substrate binding (binding energies, ΔG of wild-type vs. mutant: ‒15 vs. ‒13.8 kcal/mol; and dissociation constant, Kd of wild-type vs. mutant: 7.2E-12 vs. 7.0E-11 M). The missense mutations p.G653D and p.R1999W on the TG protein showed altered ΔG (0.24 kcal/mol and 0.79 kcal/mol, respectively). In conclusion, an in silico analysis of TSHR genetic variants in the 3'-UTR showed that they alter the binding affinities of different miRs. The TPO protein structure and mutant protein complex (p.S398T) are less stable, with potentially deleterious effects.  A structural and energy analysis showed that TG mutations (p.G653D and p.R1999W)  reduce the stability of the TG protein and affect its structure-functional relationship.	0
33756184	Involvement of different hemoprotein thiol groups of Oncorhynchus mykiss in cadmium toxicity.	BACKGROUND: Cadmium is considered the seventh most toxic heavy metal as per ATSDR ranking but its mechanism of toxicity is debated. Recently, we evaluated the effects of this metal on the erythrocyte of teleost fish (Oncorhynchus mykiss) leading us to hypothesize that the pro-oxidant activity of cadmium is not linked  to mitochondria but more likely to haemoglobin. In this context, the main aim of  this work was to detect the ability of Cd to induce structural perturbation in haemoproteins that present different structures and thus different functional properties and to identify what sites of interaction are mainly involved. METHODS: The effect of Cd on the structural destabilization of the different haemoproteins was followed spectrophometrically through their precipitation. In addition, the sites of interaction between the different haemoproteins and bivalent cadmium ions were identified by MIB server followed by molecular docking/molecular dynamics simulations both in the dimeric and tetrameric associations. RESULTS: Cadmium does not influence the autoxidation rate of Mb, HbA and trout HbI. However, the presence of this metal accelerates the precipitation process in trout HbIV in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the presence of 1-10-50-250-500-1000 μM GSH, a chelating agent, reduces the ability of cadmium to accelerate the denaturation process although it is not able to completely prevent it. In order to explain the experimental results, a computational investigations  was carried out to identify the cadmium cation affinity for the studied haemoglobins and myoglobin, both in their dimeric and tetrameric forms. As a result, the highest affinity cadmium binding sites for fish HbIV are located at the interface between tetramer-tetramer association, indicating that the cation can assist supramolecular protein aggregations and induce complex precipitation.  For mammalian Hb, Mb and fish HbI computational investigation did not detect any  site where Cd could to induce such aggregation, in line with the experimental results. CONCLUSION: The present study provides new information on the mechanisms of toxicity of cadmium by specific interaction with trout O. mykiss haemoglobin component.	0
34596360	Severity of respiratory disease is correlated with time of first oral feeding and need for a gastrostomy tube at discharge in premature infants born at <30 weeks of gestation.	BACKGROUND: Premature infants who cannot achieve full oral feeds may need a gastrostomy tube (GT) to be discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). We previously developed a model to predict which infants born <30 weeks (w) gestational age (GA) will require a GT before discharge. Here we report the detailed respiratory variable data to describe the general respiratory course for infants in the NICU < 30 w GA at birth and the association between different levels of respiratory support with postmenstrual age (PMA) at the time of first oral feeding attempt (PMAff), including later need for GT for discharge. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 391 NICU admissions comprising test (2015-2016) and validation (2017-2018) cohorts. Data, including respiratory support, were collected on 204 infants, 41 GT and 163 non-GT, in the test cohort, and 187 infants, 37 GT, and 150 non-GT, in the validation cohort. RESULTS: Respiratory data were significantly different between GT and non-GT infants. Infants who required GT for discharge were on significantly higher respiratory support at 30 days of age, 32 w PMA, and 36 w PMA. Respiratory parameters were highly correlated with PMAff. CONCLUSION: Respiratory status predicts PMAff, which was the variable in our previously described model that was most predictive of failure to achieve full oral feeding. These data provide a catalyst to develop strategies for improving oral feeding outcome for infants requiring prolonged respiratory support in the NICU.	0
34228768	Prevalence of excessive screen time and its association with developmental delay  in children aged <5 years: A population-based cross-sectional study in India.	The global growth of electronic media usage among children has caused concerns regarding screen time (ST) impact on child development. No previous population-based studies have evaluated ST and child development in India. This study aimed to determine the burden of ST, associated sociodemographic factors, and its impact on domains of child development. A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted in the field practice area of rural and urban health centers in Tamil Nadu, India. A total of 718 children (396 rural and 322 urban) were selected, using a cluster random sampling method. ST estimates were obtained from parents/guardian after a 7-day observation period. The Communication DEALL Developmental Checklist was used to assess child development. The mean ST was 2.39 hours/day (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.23-2.54), and the prevalence of excessive ST was 73% (95% CI: 69.2-76.8). Excessive ST was significantly associated with the mothers' ST, screen usage at bedtime, birth order (in children < 2 years), and attending school (in children ≥ 2 years). Increased ST was significantly associated with developmental delay, in particular, in the domains of language acquisition and communication. In children aged ≥ 2 years, a delay in ≥ 3 domains was associated with ST (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 17.75, 95% CI: 5.04-62.49, p < 0.001), as was language delay (AOR = 52.92, 95% CI: 12.33-227.21, p < 0.001). In children aged < 2 years, a delay in ≥ 2 domains was associated with ST (AOR = 16.79, 95% CI: 2.26-124.4, p < 0.001), as was language delay (AOR = 20.93, 95% CI: 2.68-163.32, p < 0.01). A very high prevalence of excessive ST was identified, with a significant association with developmental delay in children. There is an urgent need to include education on  ST limits at the primary healthcare level.	0
33795482	Metric Development for the Multicenter Improving Pediatric Sepsis Outcomes (IPSO) Collaborative.	BACKGROUND: A 56 US hospital collaborative, Improving Pediatric Sepsis Outcomes,  has developed variables, metrics and a data analysis plan to track quality improvement (QI)-based patient outcomes over time. Improving Pediatric Sepsis Outcomes expands on previous pediatric sepsis QI efforts by improving electronic  data capture and uniformity across sites. METHODS: An expert panel developed metrics and corresponding variables to assess  improvements across the care delivery spectrum, including the emergency department, acute care units, hematology and oncology, and the ICU. Outcome, process, and balancing measures were represented. Variables and statistical process control charts were mapped to each metric, elucidating progress over time and informing plan-do-study-act cycles. Electronic health record (EHR) abstraction feasibility was prioritized. Time 0 was defined as time of earliest sepsis recognition (determined electronically), or as a clinically derived time 0 (manually abstracted), identifying earliest physiologic onset of sepsis. RESULTS: Twenty-four evidence-based metrics reflected timely and appropriate interventions for a uniformly defined sepsis cohort. Metrics mapped to statistical process control charts with 44 final variables; 40 could be abstracted automatically from multiple EHRs. Variables, including high-risk conditions and bedside huddle time, were challenging to abstract (reported in <80% of encounters). Size or type of hospital, method of data abstraction, and previous QI collaboration participation did not influence hospitals' abilities to contribute data. To date, 90% of data have been submitted, representing 200 007 sepsis episodes. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive data dictionary was developed for the largest pediatric sepsis QI collaborative, optimizing automation and ensuring sustainable reporting. These approaches can be used in other large-scale sepsis QI projects in which researchers seek to leverage EHR data abstraction.	0
35269601	Systematic Comparison of Beetle Luciferase-Luciferin Pairs as Sources of Near-Infrared Light for In Vitro and In Vivo Applications.	Luciferases catalyze light-emitting reactions that produce a rainbow of colors from their substrates (luciferins), molecular oxygen, and often additional cofactors. These bioluminescence (BL) systems have afforded an incredible variety of basic research and medical applications. Driven by the importance of BL-based  non-invasive animal imaging (BLI) applications, especially in support of cancer research, new BL systems have been developed by engineering beetle luciferase (Luc) variants and synthetic substrate combinations to produce red to near-infrared (nIR) light to improve imaging sensitivity and resolution. To stimulate the application of BLI research and advance the development of improved reagents for BLI, we undertook a systematic comparison of the spectroscopic and BL properties of seven beetle Lucs with LH2 and nine substrates, which included two new quinoline ring-containing analogs. The results of these experiments with  purified Luc enzymes in vitro and in live HEK293T cells transfected with luc genes have enabled us to identify Luc/analog combinations with improved properties compared to those previously reported and to provide live cell BL data that may be relevant to in vivo imaging applications. Additionally, we found strong candidate enzyme/substrate pairs for in vitro biomarker applications requiring nIR sources with minimal visible light components. Notably, one of our  new substrates paired with a previously developed Luc variant was demonstrated to be an excellent in vitro source of nIR and a potentially useful BL system for improved resolution in BLI.	0
33187500	Feature-driven classification reveals potential comorbid subtypes within childhood apraxia of speech.	BACKGROUND: Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with heterogeneous communication and other comorbid manifestations. While previous studies have characterized speech deficits associated with CAS, few studies have examined variability in reading and language and/or other developmental comorbidities. We sought to identify comorbid subgroups within CAS  that could be clinically relevant as well as genetically distinctive. METHODS: In a group of 31 children with CAS and 8 controls, we performed hierarchical cluster analysis utilizing measures of articulation, vocabulary, and reading. We also conducted a chart review of the children with CAS to examine other clinical characteristics in these children and their association with subgroup membership. RESULTS: We identified 3 comorbid subgroups within CAS of varying severity. The high severity subgroup was characterized by poor reading and vocabulary, and the  moderate severity subgroup by poor reading and non-word repetition but average vocabulary, compared to the mild severity subgroup. Subgroups were indistinguishable with respect to speech sound production, the hallmark of CAS, all demonstrating poor articulation. Children in the most severe subgroup were more likely to have early problems feeding (p = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: Children with CAS may potentially be classified into comorbidity groups based on performance on vocabulary and reading measures, providing additional insight into the heterogeneity within CAS with implications for educational interventions.	0
33768382	Bisexual Men Living with HIV: Wellbeing, Connectedness and the Impact of Stigma.	Social research with people living with HIV (PLHIV) rarely distinguishes between  gay men and bisexual men. However, bisexual men may have unique experiences of HIV-related stigma and distinct support needs. In this paper, findings are presented from a cross-sectional survey of Australian PLHIV, which included the Berger (HIV) stigma scale. A total of 872 PLHIV completed the survey, of which 48 (6.0%) were bisexual men. Bisexual men reported higher levels of internalised HIV-related stigma, greater negative self-image and poorer emotional wellbeing than gay men. Bisexual men also reported less social support, less connection with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) communities, and less  connection with other PLHIV. Analysis of data from an open-text question revealed feelings of social isolation and fear of rejection was associated with participant's HIV diagnosis. Study findings suggest that existing social supports for PLHIV may not adequately address the unique support needs of bisexual men.	0
34375787	Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel coumarin derivatives in rhabdoviral  clearance.	Diseases caused by rhabdoviruses have had a huge impact on the productive lives of the entire human population. The main problem is the lack of drugs for the treatment of this family of viruses. Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), the causative agent of IHN, is a typical rhabdovirus which has caused huge losses to the salmonid industry. Therefore, in this study, IHNV was studied  as a model to evaluate the antiviral activity of 35 novel coumarin derivatives. Coumarin A9 was specifically selected for further validation studies upon comparing the half maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) of four screened candidate derivatives in epithelioma papulosum cyprinid (EPC) cells, as it exhibited an IC50 value of 2.96 μM against IHNV. The data revealed that A9 treatment significantly suppressed the virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) in EPC cells. In addition, A9 showed IC50 values of 1.68 and 2.12 μM for two other rhabdoviruses, spring viremia of carp virus and micropterus salmoides rhabdovirus, respectively. Furthermore, our results suggest that A9 exerts antiviral activity, but not by destroying the virus particles and interfering with the adsorption of IHNV. Moreover, we found that A9 had an inhibitory effect  on IHNV-induced apoptosis in EPC cells, as reflected by the protection against cell swelling, formation of apoptotic bodies, and loss of cell morphology and nuclear division. There was a 19.05 % reduction in the number of apoptotic cells  in the A9 treatment group compared with that in the IHNV group. In addition, enzyme activity assays proved that A9 suppressed the expression of caspase 3, 8 and 9. These results suggested that A9 inhibit viral replication, to some extent, by blocking IHNV-induced apoptosis. In an in vivo study, A9 exhibited an anti-rhabdovirus effect in virus-infected fish by substantially enhancing the survival rate. Consistent with the above results, A9 repressed IHNV gene expression in virus-sensitive tissues (brain, kidney and spleen) in the early stages of virus infection. Importantly, the data showed that horizontal transmission of IHNV was reduced by A9 in a static cohabitation challenge model,  especially in fish that underwent bath treatment, suggesting that A9 might be a suitable therapeutic agent for IHNV in aquaculture. Therefore, coumarin derivatives can be developed as antiviral agents against rhabdoviruses.	0
34261866	Siamit: A Novel Academic-Tribal Health Partnership in Northwest Alaska.	PROBLEM: American Indians and Alaska Natives hold a state-conferred right to health, yet significant health and health care disparities persist. Academic medical centers are resource-rich institutions committed to public service, yet few are engaged in responsive, equitable, and lasting tribal health partnerships  to address these challenges. APPROACH: Maniilaq Association, a rural and remote tribal health organization in  Northwest Alaska, partnered with Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School to address health care needs through physician staffing, training, and quality improvement initiatives. This partnership, called Siamit, falls under tribal governance, focuses on supporting community health leaders, addresses challenges shaped by extreme geographic remoteness, and advances the mission of academic medicine in the context of tribal health priorities. OUTCOMES: Throughout the 2019-2020 academic year, Siamit augmented local physician staffing, mentored health professions trainees, provided continuing medical education courses, implemented quality improvement initiatives, and provided clinical care and operational support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Siamit began with a small budget and limited human resources, demonstrating that  relatively small investments in academic-tribal health partnerships can support meaningful and positive outcomes. NEXT STEPS: During the 2020-2021 academic year, the authors plan to expand Siamit's efforts with a broader social medicine curriculum, additional attending  staff, more frequent trainee rotations, an increasingly robust mentorship network for Indigenous health professions trainees, and further study of the impact of these efforts. Such partnerships may be replicable in other settings and represent a significant opportunity to advance community health priorities, strengthen tribal health systems, support the next generation of Indigenous health leaders, and carry out the academic medicine mission of teaching, research, and service.	0
33778734	mTOR Inhibitor Therapy for Tuberous Sclerosis Complex: Longitudinal Study of Muscle Mass Determined by Abdominal Cross-sectional Imaging with CT and MRI.	Purpose: To determine the effect of chronic mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)  inhibition on skeletal muscle mass in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, patients with TSC who were taking mTOR inhibitors and who underwent at least two abdominal CT or MRI examinations between 2005 and 2017 were included (n = 24; 14 males; mean age, 14.5 years ± 7.8 [standard deviation] at first examination). One reviewer drew regions of interest around psoas muscles at L3 to measure cross-sectional area. Multiple linear mixed-effect modeling was performed to evaluate the association between muscle mass and the covariates over time. Results: The 24 patients underwent a total of 129 abdominal CT or MRI examinations. Median duration of mTOR inhibition at last examination was 106 months (range, 1310-3717 days). There was no significant association between the  duration of mTOR inhibitor therapy and psoas muscle area on multiple linear mixed-effect modeling (P = .055); however, patient height and height squared were significant predictors of psoas area (P = .014 and P < .0001, respectively). Conclusion: Duration of mTOR inhibition in TSC was not significantly associated with a decrease in psoas muscle area, suggesting that chronic mTOR inhibition is  not associated with sarcopenia.Keywords: CT, MR-Imaging, Pediatrics© RSNA, 2020.	0
34295335	GAS1: A New β-Glucan Immunostimulant Candidate to Increase Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) Resistance to Bacterial Infections With Aeromonas salmonicida achromogenes.	β-glucans are prebiotic and/or food additives used by the aquaculture industry to enhance the immune response of fish. Their efficiency may vary according to their origin and structure. In this study, the immunostimulant effects of two β-glucan  types extracted from wild-type baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and its null-mutant Gas1 were investigated. Gas1 has a beta-1,3-glucanosyltransferase activity necessary for cell wall assembly. Using a positive (commercial product MacroGard®) and a negative control (a diet without glucans), we evaluated the immune responses and disease resistance of rainbow trout juveniles (mean weight,  ~44 g) fed control, low (0.2%) and high (0.5%) doses of Macrogard®, Gas1, and Wild type-β-glucan after a short-term (15 days, D15) or mid-term (36 days, D36) feeding periods. We found that β-glucan supplemented diets did not affect growth  performance, mortality, splenic index, or leukocyte respiratory burst activity on D15 nor D36. However, each β-glucan triggered different immune effectors, depending of the doses or length of exposure compared to others and/or the negative control. Indeed, high dose of MacroGard® significantly increased lysozyme activities at D15 compared with the control and other diets (p<0.05). At D36, MacroGard β-glucan enhanced the production of lymphocytes in comparison with the control diet (p<0.05). Regarding WT β-glucan, at D36, WT-β-glucan, especially the high dose, provided the highest enzymatic activities (lysozyme and ACH50) and Ig level (p<0.01). Furthermore, on D36, Gas1 also increased lysozyme activity, Ig proportion, and some immune genes (mcsfra, hepcidin) compared with MacroGard® (p<0.05). Besides, both doses of Gas1-β-glucans increased the resistance of juveniles to bacterial infection highlighted by a higher survival rate at 14 days post-challenge compared with the control and other types and doses of β-glucans (p<0.05). In conclusion, our results suggest that Gas1-β-glucan could represent a promising immunostimulant that would help to prevent diseases in aquaculture even more efficiently than other β-glucans already in use. Mode of action and particular efficiency of this new Gas1 mutant are debated.	0
34315907	Association between genes regulating neural pathways for quantitative traits of speech and language disorders.	Speech sound disorders (SSD) manifest as difficulties in phonological memory and  awareness, oral motor function, language, vocabulary, reading, and spelling. Families enriched for SSD are rare, and typically display a cluster of deficits.  We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 435 children from 148 families in the Cleveland Family Speech and Reading study (CFSRS), examining 16 variables representing 6 domains. Replication was conducted using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). We identified 18 significant loci (combined p < 10-8) that we pursued bioinformatically. We prioritized 5 novel gene regions with likely functional repercussions on neural pathways, including those which colocalized with differentially methylated regions in our sample. Polygenic risk scores for receptive language, expressive vocabulary, phonological awareness, phonological memory, spelling, and reading decoding associated with increasing clinical severity. In summary, neural-genetic influence on SSD is primarily multigenic and acts on genomic regulatory elements, similar to other neurodevelopmental disorders.	0
34698704	Infant Mental Health Home Visiting Mitigates Impact of Maternal Adverse Childhood Experiences on Toddler Language Competence: A Randomized Controlled Trial.	OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to test the impact of maternal adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on subsequent child language competence; higher parental ACEs were expected to predict risk of toddler language delay. Participation in Infant Mental Health Home Visiting (IMH-HV) treatment, which aims to enhance responsive caregiving and improve child social-emotional development, was expected to mitigate this association. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) design was used. ACEs data were collected at baseline. Child language screening (using the Preschool Language Scales Screening Test) was conducted 12 months later by masters-level evaluators  who were blind to treatment condition. Visits occurred in participants' homes. Participants were community-recruited and were randomized to treatment (psychotherapeutic IMH-HV) or control (treatment as usual). Data come from 62 families who participated in all waves of an RCT testing the efficacy of IMH-HV;  mothers were eligible based on child age (<24 mo at enrollment) and endorsement of ≥2 sociodemographic eligibility criteria (economic disadvantage, depression, perceived parenting challenges, and/or high ACEs). RESULTS: The age of mothers enrolled in this ranged from 19 to 44 years (M = 31.91; SD = 5.68); child age at baseline ranged from prenatal to 26 months (M = 12.06; SD = 6.62). The maternal ACE score predicted child language competence (t  (5,55) = -3.27, p = 0.002). This effect was moderated by treatment (t (6,54) = 1.73, p = 0.04), indicating no association between maternal ACEs and child language for those randomized to IMH-HV. CONCLUSION: The results highlight that the effects of parent ACEs on early childhood outcomes may be buffered by participation in psychotherapeutic home visiting (trial registration: NCT03175796).	0
35153286	Use of Vancomycin Powder in Spinal Deformity Surgery in Cerebral Palsy Patients is Associated With Proteus Surgical Site Infections.	PURPOSE: Surgical site infection (SSI) rates in pediatric spinal deformity surgery for cerebral palsy (CP) patients are higher than that in idiopathic scoliosis. The use of vancomycin powder is associated with decreased risk of SSI  in neuromuscular patients. Prior studies in adult and pediatric early-onset scoliosis patients have shown that vancomycin powder alters microbacterial profile in patients that develop SSI. However, the effects of topical vancomycin  powder on microbiology in spinal deformity surgery for CP patients has not been studied. METHODS: An international multicenter database of CP neuromuscular scoliosis patients was used in this retrospective cohort study. All patients that underwent posterior spinal instrumented fusion for CP neuromuscular scoliosis from 2008 to  2019 were queried, and 50 cases complicated by postoperative SSI were identified. Intraoperative antibiotic details were documented in 49 cases (98.0%). Microbiology details were documented in 45 cases (91.8%). Microbiology for patients that received topical vancomycin powder were compared with patients that did not. A multivariate regression model was used to control for potential confounders. RESULTS: There were 45 patients included in this study. There were 27 males (60.0%) and 18 females (40.0%). Mean age at surgery was 14.8±2.4 years. There were 24 patients that received topical vancomycin powder (53.3%). The mean time from index surgery to SSI was 4.3±11.3 months.On univariate analysis of microbiology cultures by vancomycin powder cohort, there were no significant differences in culture types. Proteus spp. trended on significance with association with vancomycin powder use (P=0.078). When controlling for potential  confounders on multivariate analysis, intraoperative topical vancomycin powder was associated with increased risk for proteus infection (adjusted odds ratio: 262.900, 95% confidence interval: 1.806-38,267.121, P=0.028). DISCUSSION: In CP patients undergoing pediatric spinal deformity surgery, the use of vancomycin powder was independently associated with increased risk for proteus infections. Further study into antibiotic regimens for spinal deformity surgery in the CP population should be performed. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III-retrospective cohort study.	0
33746060	In vitro evaluation of novel (nanoparticle) oral delivery systems allow selection of gut immunomodulatory formulations.	Oral delivery is the most convenient way to vaccinate cultured fish, however it is still problematic, primarily due to a lack of a commercially valid vaccine vehicle to protect the antigen against gastric degradation and ensure its uptake  from the intestine. With the goal of advancing the potential to vaccinate orally, this study evaluates a novel silicon nanoparticle-based vehicle (VacSaf carrier). Aeromonas salmonicida antigens were formulated with the VacSaf carrier using different preparation methods to generate dry powder and liquid formulations. Twelve formulations were first subjected to an in vitro evaluation where the A. salmonicida bacterin conjugated to VacSaf carriers were found superior at inducing pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in primary leucocyte cultures and the macrophage/monocyte cell line RTS-11 compared with A. salmonicida bacterin alone. This was especially apparent after exposure to acid conditions to mimic stomach processing. One formulation (FD1) was taken forward to oral delivery using two doses and two administration schedules (5 days vs 10 days, the latter 5 days on, 5 days off, 5 days on), and the transcript changes of immune genes in the intestine (pyloric caeca, midgut and hindgut) and spleen were evaluated by qPCR and serum IgM was measured by ELISA. The VacSaf carrier alone was shown to be safe for use in vivo, in that no side-effects were seen, but it did induce expression of some cytokines, and may have value as an oral adjuvant candidate. The FD1 bacterin formulation was effective at inducing a range of cytokines associated with innate and adaptive immunity, mainly in the pyloric caeca, compared to A. salmonicida bacterin alone (which had almost no effect), and confirms the immune competence of this gut region following appropriate oral vaccination. These results reveal that in vitro screening of formulations for oral delivery has value and can be used to assess the most promising formulations to test further.	0
35202890	Time Course of Retinopathy of Prematurity Regression and Reactivation After Treatment with Ranibizumab or Laser in the RAINBOW Trial.	PURPOSE: To study the time course of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) regression  and reactivation after treatment with intravitreal ranibizumab or laser in the ranibizumab compared with laser therapy for the treatment of infants born prematurely with ROP trial. DESIGN: Post hoc analysis of a randomized, clinical trial. SUBJECTS: A total of 225 infants (448 eyes) were randomized to ranibizumab 0.2 mg (n = 74, 148 eyes), ranibizumab 0.1 mg (n = 77, 152 eyes), and laser (n = 74, 148 eyes). METHODS: Features of disease regression were measured using time-to-event analysis per eye, corrected for within-subject association. Analyses of disease reactivation and additional treatments were descriptive. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Median time to regression of plus disease, stage 3 ROP, aggressive posterior (AP)-ROP to 24-week follow-up and disease reactivation and first additional treatment to 2-year follow-up. RESULTS: The median times to regression after ranibizumab 0.2 mg vs. laser were as follows: plus disease, 4 vs. 16 days (P < 0.001); stage 3 ROP, 8 vs. 16 days (P = 0.004); and AP-ROP, 7.3 vs. 22 days (P = 0.03). Results for ranibizumab 0.1  mg were similar to those for 0.2 mg, with a median of 4, 9, and 8 days, respectively. Additional treatments were given in 34 (25%) of 138 eyes after laser and 40 (27%) of 146 and 42 (28%) of 152 eyes after 0.2 mg and 0.1 mg ranibizumab, respectively. Incomplete disease regression requiring additional treatment occurred in 30 (22%) of 138 eyes after laser after a median interval of 15 days compared with 11 (8%) of 146 and 9 (6%) of 152 after 0.2 mg and 0.1 mg ranibizumab after a median interval of 21 and 13 days, respectively. Retinopathy  of prematurity reactivation requiring additional treatment occurred in 3 (2%) of  138 eyes after laser after a median interval of 43 days compared with 22 (15%) of 146 and 26 (17%) of 152 after 0.2 and 0.1 mg ranibizumab after a median interval  of 53.5 (maximum, 105) and 54.5 days (maximum, 128), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal 0.2 or 0.1 mg ranibizumab induced a faster regression of plus disease, stage 3 ROP, and AP-ROP than laser did. Ranibizumab was associated with fewer additional treatments for incomplete disease regression but more for disease reactivation.	0
35353778	The Arched Rainbow Brow in Thyroid Eye Disease.	PURPOSE: To morphologically describe and mathematically quantify a novel clinical feature of thyroid eye disease (TED). METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of TED patients and age-sex-matched  normal controls. The arched Rainbow Brow appearance in TED patients was determined by unanimous agreement of 3 oculoplastic surgeons. Eyebrow curvature was assessed by plotting 15 points along the eyebrow in ImageJ. The fourth-degree polynomial (y = ax + bx + cx + dx + e) was fitted to each eyebrow. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-one eyes were analyzed (200 TED and 71 age-sex-matched normal controls). A Rainbow Brow was identified in 42% of TED patients. A unilateral Rainbow Brow was seen in 15% of patients. The fourth-degree polynomial coefficients yielded significant differences between Rainbow Brow patients and age-sex-matched normal controls for the coefficients a, b, c, and d. Similar analysis of TED patients with and without a Rainbow Brow showed differences in coefficients a and b. Age >50 years (p = 0.009) and the presence of brow fat expansion (p < 0.001) were associated with the presence of a Rainbow Brow. Proptosis >24 mm showed a trend toward association with the presence of a Rainbow Brow (p = 0.057). When considering the contribution of these features in a multivariable analysis, only brow fat expansion was a significant contributing factor (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The Rainbow Brow is a distinct entity in TED and is likely consequent to brow fat pad expansion. Patients with a Rainbow Brow have different eyebrow curvature as compared to both normal age-sex-matched controls and TED patients without a Rainbow Brow.	0
33527498	Heterogeneous genetic basis of age at maturity in salmonid fishes.	Understanding the genetic basis of repeated evolution of the same phenotype across taxa is a fundamental aim in evolutionary biology and has applications in  conservation and management. However, the extent to which interspecific life-history trait polymorphisms share evolutionary pathways remains underexplored. Here, we address this gap by studying the genetic basis of a key life-history trait, age at maturity, in four species of Pacific salmonids (genus  Oncorhynchus) that exhibit intra- and interspecific variation in this trait-Chinook Salmon, Coho Salmon, Sockeye Salmon, and Steelhead Trout. We tested for associations in all four species between age at maturity and two genome regions, six6 and vgll3, that are strongly associated with the same trait in Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar). We also conducted a genome-wide association analysis in Steelhead to assess whether additional regions were associated with this trait. We found the genetic basis of age at maturity to be heterogeneous across salmonid species. Significant associations between six6 and age at maturity were observed in two of the four species, Sockeye and Steelhead, with the association in Steelhead being particularly strong in both sexes (p = 4.46 × 10-9 after adjusting for genomic inflation). However, no significant  associations were detected between age at maturity and the vgll3 genome region in any of the species, despite its strong association with the same trait in Atlantic Salmon. We discuss possible explanations for the heterogeneous nature of the genetic architecture of this key life-history trait, as well as the implications of our findings for conservation and management.	0
34970513	Results From the WAGR Syndrome Patient Registry: Characterization of WAGR Spectrum and Recommendations for Care Management.	WAGR syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by Wilms tumor, Aniridia,  Genitourinary anomalies, and Range of developmental delays. In addition to the classic features, patients affected by WAGR syndrome can develop obesity and kidney failure, and a wide variety of non-classical manifestations have also been described. This suggests that a broader phenotypic spectrum beyond the classic syndrome exists and here we demonstrate that spectrum using data from the WAGR Syndrome Patient Registry. In the present study, we collected information from 91 individuals enrolled in the registry to explore self-reported health issues in this patient population. A wide variety of common clinical issues not classically associated with the disorder were found, prompting the redefinition from WAGR syndrome to WAGR spectrum disorder to incorporate the phenotypic variations that  occur. A comprehensive care management approach is needed to address the wide range of clinical issues and we propose a care model for patients affected by WAGR spectrum disorder. Further research is needed to solidify the breath of the  phenotype and confirm the observations in this study to advance individualized patient care in this population.	0
33650472	Disrupted caregiving behavior as a mediator of the relation between disrupted prenatal maternal representations and toddler social-emotional functioning.	The development of maternal representations of the child during pregnancy guides  a mother's thoughts, feelings, and behavior toward her child. The association between prenatal representations, particularly those that are disrupted, and toddler social-emotional functioning is not well understood. The present study examined associations between disrupted prenatal representations and toddler social-emotional functioning and to test disrupted maternal behavior as a mediator of this association. Data were drawn from 109 women from a larger prospective longitudinal study (N=120) of women and their young children. Prenatal disrupted maternal representations were assessed using the Working Model of the Child Interview disrupted coding scheme, while disrupted maternal behavior was coded 12-months postpartum from mother-infant interactions. Mother-reported toddler social-emotional functioning was assessed at ages 12 and 24 months. Disrupted prenatal representations significantly predicted poorer toddler social-emotional functioning at 24 months, controlling for functioning at 12 months. Further, disrupted maternal behavior mediated the relation between disrupted prenatal representations and toddler social-emotional problems. Screening for disrupted representations during pregnancy is needed to facilitate  referrals to early intervention and decrease the likelihood of toddler social-emotional problems.	0
34469395	Operative Treatment of Cervical Spine Injuries Sustained in Youth Sports.	BACKGROUND: Little data exists on surgical outcomes of sports-related cervical spine injuries (CSI) sustained in children and adolescent athletes. This study reviewed demographics, injury characteristics, management, and operative outcomes of severe CSI encountered in youth sports. METHODS: Children below 18 years with operative sports-related CSI at a Level 1 pediatric trauma center were reviewed (2004 to 2019). All patients underwent morden cervical spine instrumentation and fusion. Clinical, radiographic, and surgical characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 3231 patients (mean, 11.3±4.6 y) with neck pain were evaluated for CSI. Sports/recreational activities were the most common etiology in 1358 cases (42.0%). Twenty-nine patients (2.1%) with sports-related CSI (mean  age, 14.5 y; range, 6.4 to 17.8 y) required surgical intervention. Twenty-five were males (86%). Operative CSI occurred in football (n=8), wrestling (n=7), gymnastics (n=5), diving (n=4), trampoline (n=2), hockey (n=1), snowboarding (n=1), and biking (n=1). Mechanisms were 27 hyperflexion/axial loading (93%) and  2 hyperextension injuries (7%). Most were cervical fractures (79%) and subaxial injuries (79%). Seven patients (24%) sustained spinal cord injury (SCI) and 3 patients (10%) cord contusion or myelomalacia without neurological deficits. The  risk of SCI increased with age (P=0.03). Postoperatively, 2 SCI patients (29%) improved 1 American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale Grade and 1 (14%)  improved 2 American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale Grades. Increased  complications developed in SCI than non-SCI cases (mean, 2.0 vs. 0.1 complications; P=0.02). Bony fusion occurred in 26/28 patients (93%) after a median of 7.2 months (interquartile range, 6 to 15 mo). Ten patients (34%) returned to their baseline sport and 9 (31%) to lower-level activities. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of sports-related CSI requiring surgery is low with differences in age/sex, sport, and injury patterns. Older males with hyperflexion/axial loading injuries in contact sports were at greatest risk of SCI, complications, and permanent disability. Prevention campaigns, education on  proper tackling techniques, and neck strength training are required in sports at  high risk of hyperflexion/axial loading injury. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III-retrospective cohort study.	0
35110590	Behavioural traits of rainbow trout and brown trout may help explain their differing invasion success and impacts.	Animal behaviour is increasingly recognised as critical to the prediction of non-native species success and impacts. Rainbow trout and brown trout have been introduced globally, but there appear to be differences in their patterns of invasiveness and ecological impact. Here, we investigated whether diploid rainbow trout and diploid and triploid brown trout differ among several key behavioural measures linked to invasiveness and impact. We assessed activity, boldness, aggression, and feeding, using open field, novel object, shelter, mirror, feeding, and functional response experiments. We also tested within each fish type for behavioural syndromes comprising correlations among activity, boldness and aggression. Rainbow trout were more active and aggressive but less bold than  diploid and triploid brown trout. In small groups, however, rainbow trout were bolder than both types of brown trout. Diploid brown trout were more active and bolder than triploids when tested individually, and had a higher functional response than both rainbow trout and triploid brown trout. In terms of behavioural syndromes, there was no association between activity and boldness in  rainbow trout, however, there was in both brown trout types. The increased activity and aggression of rainbow trout may reflect an increased stress response to novel situations, with this response reduced in a group. These results suggest that rainbow trout do not manage their energy budgets effectively, and may explain why they have limited survival as invaders. In addition, the lower functional response of rainbow trout may explain why they are implicated in fewer ecological impacts, and the triploidy treatment also appears to lower the potential impact of brown trout. Comparative analyses of multiple behaviours of invasive species and genetic variants may thus be key to understanding and predicting invader success and ecological impacts.	0
34808671	Pediatric Resident Perspectives on the Impact of COVID-19 on Training.	OBJECTIVES: At the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, disruptions to pediatric care and training were immediate and significant. We sought to understand the impact of the pandemic on residency training from the perspective  of pediatric residents. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of categorical pediatric residents at US training programs at the end of the 2019-2020 academic year. This voluntary survey included questions that explored the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on resident training experiences, postresidency employment plans, and attitudes and perceptions. Data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics and mixed-effects regression models. We performed a sensitivity analysis using respondents from programs with a >40% response rate for questions regarding resident attitudes and perceptions. RESULTS: Residents from 127 of 201 training programs (63.2%) completed the survey, with a response rate of 18.9% (1141 of 6032). Respondents reported multiple changes to their training experience including rotation schedule adjustments, clinic cancellations, and an increase in the use of telemedicine. Respondents also reported inconsistent access to personal protective equipment and increased involvement in the care of adult patients. Graduating resident respondents reported concerns related to employment. Respondents also noted a negative impact on their personal wellness. CONCLUSIONS: Responding residents reported that nearly every aspect of their training was impacted by the pandemic. Describing their experiences may help residency program and hospital leaders supplement missed educational experiences, better support residents through the remaining months of the pandemic, and better prepare for extraordinary circumstances in the future.	0
33609959	Disability measurement in Multiple Sclerosis patients 55 years and older: What is the Expanded Disability Status Scale really telling clinicians?	BACKGROUND: The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) measures disease progression in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). EDSS changes are assumed to be due to worsening MS-related disability. Strict interpretation of this premise may include some normal findings as abnormal, inflating the disability score. Further, determining the cause of neurologic symptoms can be difficult in an older population with comorbid illness and polypharmacy. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between EDSS, age, comorbidities and polypharmacy. METHODS: 106 people, 55 years and older, with and without MS were administered the EDSS and a validated comorbidity questionnaire. Polypharmacy was also assessed. RESULTS: Median EDSS scores were 6.0 in people with MS and 3.0 in people without  MS. No participant in our cohort had an EDSS of 0. Higher EDSS scores were associated with older age and more polypharmacy. Pyramidal and cerebellar functional systems accounted for the largest percentage of unique variance between groups. CONCLUSION: Older individuals with and without MS demonstrated significant disability on the EDSS. These findings indicate that EDSS scores may be partially due to factors other than MS. Our understanding of disease course and disability  may benefit from the development of normative EDSS scores to correct for these factors.	0
34625830	Skeletal muscle mass as a marker to predict outcomes in children and young adults with cancer.	PURPOSE: Nutrition is an important outcome predictor in oncology patients including treatment response, physical disability, quality of life, and overall survival. Sarcopenia (loss of skeletal muscle mass and function) is a demonstrated marker of nutritional status in adults, but data are more limited in children. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether total psoas muscle area (tPMA) measured at the time of cancer diagnosis predicts overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DFS), or number of days neutropenic. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed. tPMA was measured at the L3 and L4  mid-lumbar vertebral body level by a single reviewer on cross-sectional imaging studies performed within 2 weeks of primary oncologic diagnosis for all oncology  patients who received their primary therapy at Cincinnati Children's Hospital between 1/1/2000 and 12/31/2013. Spearman's correlation was used to assess the association between tPMA and OS, DFS, days neutropenic, and adjusted days neutropenic. Subanalysis was performed assessing the relationship of tumor type and age at diagnosis with each parameter. RESULTS: 164 patients (median age 9.9 years; 89 M/75 F) were included in the study. Days neutropenic and normalized days neutropenic were significantly but weakly negatively correlated with tPMA at L3 (r =  - 0.24, p < 0.002 and r =  - 0.18, p < 0.05 respectively) and L4 (r =  - 0.25, p < 0.002; and and r =  - 0.19, p < 0.02 respectively). At subanalysis, the correlation between anthropometric features and normalized days neutropenic was only seen with brain  tumors. There was no statistically significant relationship between sarcopenia at diagnosis and DFS or OS overall or in subanalysis. CONCLUSION: There is a weak inverse relationship between days neutropenic and psoas muscle bulk in pediatric and young adult oncology patients suggesting a relationship between nutritional status and cell recovery. Measures of sarcopenia, however, did not correlate with DFS or OS.	0
33204599	Fabry disease in India: A multicenter study of the clinical and mutation spectrum in 54 patients.	"Fabry disease (FD) is a treatable X linked lysosomal storage disorder with a wide phenotypic spectrum. There is a scarcity of published data on the burden of FD in India. This study evaluates the clinical and molecular spectrum of Indian patients with FD. In this multicentric study involving 10 tertiary referral centers in India, we analyzed the clinical course and genotype of 54 patients from 37 families. Family screening identified 19 new patients (35%) from 12 index cases. Then, 33 GLA gene variants were identified in 49/54 (90.7%) which included 11 novel and 22 known pathogenic variants. Of the 54 patients in our cohort, 40 patients had ""classical"" and 10 patients had a ""nonclassical"" presentation. The symptoms and signs included kidney dysfunction in 38/54 (70.3%), neuropathic pain in 34/54 (62.9%), left ventricular hypertrophy in 22/49 (44.8%) and stroke in 5/54 (9.2%). Female heterozygotes were 10/54 (18.5%) of whom 2 were index cases.  There was a significant delay in reaching the diagnosis of 11.7 years. Enzyme replacement therapy was initiated in 28/54 (51.8%) patients with significant improvement of neuropathic pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. This study highlights the clinical presentation and mutational spectrum of FD in India and suggests that family screening and screening of high-risk groups (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, idiopathic chronic renal failure and cryptogenic stroke) could be the most cost-effective strategies for early identification of FD."	0
34354031	Use of Vancomycin Powder in the Surgical Treatment of Early Onset Scoliosis Is Associated With Different Microbiology Cultures After Surgical Site Infection.	BACKGROUND: The use of vancomycin powder has been shown to decrease risk of surgical site infection (SSI) in early onset scoliosis (EOS). While there is potential benefit in SSI reduction, there is also theoretical risk in creating increased bacterial resistance to standard treatment regimens. However, the effects of topical vancomycin powder on microbiology in these patients has not been studied. METHODS: A multicenter database for EOS patients was retrospectively analyzed. All patients that underwent surgical treatment with traditional growing rods, magnetically controlled growing rods, vertical expandable prosthetic titanium rib, and Shilla for EOS performed after 2010 were identified (n=1115). Patients that sustained at least 1 SSI after guided growth surgery were assessed (n=104, 9.3%). Patients with culture and antibiotic details were included (n=55). Patients that received vancomycin powder at index surgery were compared with patients that did not. A multivariate regression model was used to control for potential confounders. RESULTS: There were 55 patients included in this study, including 26 males (47%)  and 29 females (53%). Mean age at index surgery was 7.2±6.9 years. Vancomycin powder was utilized in 18 cases (33%). Mean time from index surgery to SSI was 2.0±1.3 years. There were 2 cases of wound dehiscence (4%), 7 cases of superficial infection (13%), and 46 cases of deep infection (84%).There were significant differences in overall microbiology results between vancomycin and no vancomycin cohorts (P=0.047). On univariate analysis, the vancomycin powder cohort had a significantly high incidence of cultures without growth (n=7, 39% vs. n=4, 11%, relative risk: 2.063, 95% confidence interval: 0.927-4.591, P=0.028). This association remained significant on multivariate analysis (adjusted odds ratio: 9.656, 95% confidence interval: 1.743-53.494, P=0.009). CONCLUSIONS: In EOS patients undergoing procedures complicated by SSI, the use of vancomycin powder was independently associated with increased risk of no culture  growth. Surgeons and infectious disease physicians should be aware and adjust diagnostic and treatment strategies appropriately. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III-retrospective cohort study.	0
33106153	Differences among families in craniofacial shape at early life-stages of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus).	BACKGROUND: Organismal fitness can be determined at early life-stages, but phenotypic variation at early life-stages is rarely considered in studies on evolutionary diversification. The trophic apparatus has been shown to contribute  to sympatric resource-mediated divergence in several taxa. However, processes underlying diversification in trophic traits are poorly understood. Using phenotypically variable Icelandic Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), we reared offspring from multiple families under standardized laboratory conditions and tested to what extent family (i.e. direct genetic and maternal effects) contributes to offspring morphology at hatching (H) and first feeding (FF). To understand the underlying mechanisms behind early life-stage variation in morphology, we examined how craniofacial shape varied according to family, offspring size, egg size and candidate gene expression. RESULTS: Craniofacial shape (i.e. the Meckel's cartilage and hyoid arch) was more variable between families than within families both across and within developmental stages. Differences in craniofacial morphology between developmental stages correlated with offspring size, whilst within developmental  stages only shape at FF correlated with offspring size, as well as female mean egg size. Larger offspring and offspring from females with larger eggs consistently had a wider hyoid arch and contracted Meckel's cartilage in comparison to smaller offspring. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for family-level variation in early life-stage trophic morphology, indicating the potential for parental effects to facilitate resource polymorphism.	0
34448042	Relation of Magnetic Resonance Elastography to Fontan Circulatory Failure in a Cohort of Pediatric and Adult Patients.	Elevated magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)-derived liver stiffness may be associated with worse outcomes in people with Fontan circulation. We sought to evaluate the association between liver stiffness and Fontan failure or portal hypertension. Single center cross-sectional retrospective study of people with Fontan circulation who underwent MRE between 2011 and 2020. The cohort was divided into adult (age ≥ 21 years) and pediatric (< 21 years) groups. Fontan circulatory failure (FF) was defined as any of the following: death, transplantation, ventricular assist device, heart failure symptoms requiring escalation of diuretics. Radiologic portal hypertension was defined as the presence of one or more of the following: splenomegaly, ascites, or gastrointestinal varices. 128 patients were included (average age = 22.6 ± 8.7 years) and 58 (45%) were children. Median liver stiffness was 4.3 kPa (interquartile range (IQR) 3.8-5.8) for the entire cohort. Thirty patients (23%) developed FF (16 adults, 14 children). Liver stiffness was higher  in adults with FF compared to those without FF (4.9 (IQR 4.0-6.0) vs. 4.2 (IQR 3.8-4.7) kPa, p = 0.04). There was no difference in liver stiffness between pediatric patients with and without FF (4.4 (IQR 4.1-5.4) vs. 4.4 (IQR 3.8-5.0),  p = 0.5). Adults with radiologic portal hypertension and adults with moderate or  severe atrioventricular valve regurgitation had higher liver stiffness than adults without. MRE-derived liver stiffness is associated with atrioventricular valve regurgitation, portal hypertension, and poor clinical outcomes in adults with Fontan circulation. There was no association between liver stiffness and FF  in pediatric patients. This difference may be due to the progressive nature of Fontan-associated liver disease.	0
35433825	Application of Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality in Endourology and Urolithiasis: An Update by YAU Endourology and Urolithiasis Working Group.	The integration of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) in urological practices and medical education has led to modern training systems that are cost-effective and with an increased expectation toward surgical performance and outcomes. VR aids the user in interacting with the virtual environment realistically by providing a three-dimensional (3D) view of the structures inside the body with high-level precision. AR enhances the real environment around users by integrating experience with virtual information over  physical models and objects, which in turn has improved understanding of physiological mechanisms and anatomical structures. MR is an immersive technology that provides virtual content to interact with real elements. The field of urolithiasis has adapted the technological advancements, newer instruments, and methods to perform endourologic treatment procedures. This mini-review discusses  the applications of Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality in endourology and urolithiasis.	0
34303261	Differential gene expression associated with behavioral variation in ecotypes of  Lake Superior brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis).	"Associations between behaviors and the development of different life history tactics have been documented in several species of salmon, trout, and charr. While it is well known that such behaviors are heritable the genes and molecular  pathways connected to these behaviors remain unknown. We used an RNA-seq approach to identify genes and molecular pathways differentially regulated in brain tissue between ""shy"" and ""bold"" brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). A small number of genes were differentially expressed between the behavioral types at several months after hatching and two years of age. Pathway analysis revealed that EIF2 signaling differed consistently between shy and bold individuals suggesting large-scale differences in protein synthesis between behavioral types in the brain. Additionally, the RNA-seq data were used to find polymorphisms within the  brook trout genome and a GWAS approach was used to test for statistical associations between genetic variants and behavior type. One allele located in a  transcription factor (TSHZ3) contained a protein-coding non-synonymous SNP suggesting that functional variation within TSHZ3 is connected to the development of different behaviors. These results suggest that the molecular basis of behavioral development is complex and due to the differential expression of many  genes involved in a wide-range of different molecular pathways."	0
34267153	Getting Them Back in the Game: When Can Athletes With Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Safely Return to Sports? A Mixed-effects Study of the Pediatric Orthopaedic Association of North America.	BACKGROUND: Despite the relative frequency of posterior spinal fusion (PSF) and instrumentation for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), there are limited guidelines for postoperative return to sports. Few studies explore factors influencing treating surgeons' recommendations. METHODS: A survey presenting several clinical vignettes of patients who had undergone PSF for AIS was distributed to 1496 Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America (POSNA) members. Of the 257 returned surveys, 170 met the inclusion criteria. Mixed-effects models were created to assess the effects of the surgeon  and hypothetical patient characteristics on return to jogging, noncontact, contact, and collision sports. RESULTS: Estimated marginal mean time to return to sporting activities increased  for more physically demanding sports [jogging: 4.1 mo, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.8-4.3; noncontact: 4.6 mo, 95% CI: 4.3-4.9; contact: 6.8 mo, 95% CI: 6.4-7.1; collision: 9.8 mo, 95% CI: 9.2-10.4]. Hypothetical patient characteristics (sex, age, obesity, skeletal maturity, levels fused, and fusions  ending in thoracic versus lumbar spine) were not associated with changes in return to sport recommendations for jogging, noncontact, contact, or collision activities. Surgeon volume, experience, fellowship type, and practice setting all affected return to all activities (P<0.05). Surgeons with prior complications from return to sport delayed return to collision activities (9.4 mo, 95% CI: 8.4-10.3) versus surgeons without complications (7.2 mo, 95% CI: 5.7-8.7, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons currently allow earlier return to high-intensity sports after PSF for AIS compared with previous studies. Protocol trends vary based on physician-related factors such as years in practice, case volume, fellowship training, practice type, and prior experience with complications. Patient-related factors were not found to impact return to sport protocols. This survey provides  a portrait of current practice trends and serves as a foundation for future investigation. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level V-survey study.	0
34339816	Detection of selection signatures in the genome of a farmed population of anadromous rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).	Domestication processes and artificial selection are likely to leave signatures that can be detected at a molecular level in farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). These signatures of selection are genomic regions that contain functional genetic variants conferring a higher fitness to their bearers. We genotyped 749 rainbow trout from a commercial population using a rainbow trout Axiom 57 K SNP array panel and identified putative genomic regions under selection using the pcadapt, Composite Likelihood Ratio (CLR) and Integrated Haplotype Score (iHS) methods. After applying quality-control pipelines and statistical analyses, we detected 12, 96 and 16 SNPs putatively under selection,  associated with 96, 781 and 115 candidate genes, respectively. Several of these candidate genes were associated with growth, early development, reproduction, behavior and immune system traits. In addition, some of the SNPs were found in interesting regions located in autosomal inversions on Omy05 and Omy20. These findings could represent a genome-wide map of selection signatures in farmed rainbow trout and could be important in explaining domestication and selection for genetic traits of commercial interest.	0
34768047	Maternal secure base scripts predict child attachment security in an at-risk sample.	Accumulating evidence indicates that individuals possess attachment, or secure base, scripts based on experiences with attachment figures, and these attachment  scripts predict important outcomes such as caregiving behaviors and offspring social-emotional adjustment. However, less is known about the association between parents' secure base scripts and child attachment security within at-risk samples, i.e., those known to be at greater risk for insecurity. The current study examined the relation between maternal secure base script representations and child attachment security by extending the use of the Attachment Script Assessment (ASA; Waters & Rodrigues-Doolabh, 2004) to an at-risk sample. One-hundred mother-child pairs from a larger longitudinal study participated; the larger study focused on psychosocial risks related to parenting in a primarily low-income sample. In the present study, overall ASA script scores were first compared with two independent middle-class samples, one from a U.S. study, the other an international study. Scores and statistical patterns were comparable across all samples, indicating that the ASA was successful in tapping into maternal secure base script knowledge in our at-risk sample. The relation between maternal script scores and children's Attachment Q-Set (AQS; Waters, 1995) security scores were examined at ages 1 and 2 years. Dependency scores from the AQS were also included to establish discriminant validity for the script scores.  Results indicated that maternal script knowledge predicted child security, while  showing no relation to dependency scores. Findings indicate that the ASA can be an important and viable measure for assessing attachment representations in at-risk samples of caregivers.	0
34168059	Risk Factors and Outcomes After a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event: A Multicenter Study.	BACKGROUND: The accuracy of the risk criteria for brief resolved unexplained events (BRUEs) from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is unknown. We sought to evaluate if AAP risk criteria and event characteristics predict BRUE outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective cohort included infants <1 year of age evaluated in the emergency departments (EDs) of 15 pediatric and community hospitals for a BRUE between October 1, 2015, and September 30, 2018. A multivariable regression  model was used to evaluate the association of AAP risk factors and event characteristics with risk for event recurrence, revisits, and serious diagnoses explaining the BRUE. RESULTS: Of 2036 patients presenting with a BRUE, 87% had at least 1 AAP higher-risk factor. Revisits occurred in 6.9% of ED and 10.7% of hospital discharges. A serious diagnosis was made in 4.0% (82) of cases; 45% (37) of these diagnoses were identified after the index visit. The most common serious diagnoses included seizures (1.1% [23]) and airway abnormalities (0.64% [13]). Risk is increased for a serious underlying diagnosis for patients discharged from the ED with a history of a similar event, an event duration >1 minute, an abnormal medical history, and an altered responsiveness (P < .05). AAP risk criteria for all outcomes had a negative predictive value of 90% and a positive predictive value of 23%. CONCLUSIONS: AAP BRUE risk criteria are used to accurately identify patients at low risk for event recurrence, readmission, and a serious underlying diagnosis; however, their use results in the inaccurate identification of many patients as higher risk. This is likely because many AAP risk factors, such as age, are not associated with these outcomes.	0
33490854	A Novel Homozygous Missense Mutation in the YARS Gene: Expanding the Phenotype of YARS Multisystem Disease.	Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) are crucial enzymes for protein translation. Mutations in genes encoding ARSs are associated with human disease. Tyrosyl-tRNA  synthetase is encoded by YARS which is ubiquitously expressed and implicated in an autosomal dominant form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth and autosomal recessive YARS-related multisystem disease. We report on a former 34-week gestational age male who presented at 2 months of age with failure to thrive (FTT) and cholestatic hepatitis. He was subsequently diagnosed with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia with a negative congenital hyperinsulinism gene panel and F-DOPA positron-emission tomography (PET) scan that did not demonstrate a focal lesion.  Autopsy findings were notable for overall normal pancreatic islet size and morphology. Trio whole exome sequencing identified a novel homozygous variant of  uncertain significance in YARS (c.611A > C, p.Tyr204Cys) with each parent a carrier for the YARS variant. Euglycemia was maintained with diazoxide (max dose, 18 mg/kg/day), and enteral dextrose via gastrostomy tube (G-Tube). During his prolonged hospitalization, the patient developed progressive liver disease, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, acute renal failure, recurrent infections, ichthyosis, hematologic concerns, hypotonia, and global developmental delay. Such multisystem features have been previously reported in association with pathogenic YARS mutations. Although hypoglycemia has been associated with pathogenic YARS mutations, this report provides more conclusive data that a YARS variant can cause hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. This case expands the allelic and clinical heterogeneity of YARS-related disease. In addition, YARS-related disease should be considered in the differential of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia associated with multisystem disease.	0
33878042	Lipidome association with vascular disease and inflammation in HIV+ Ugandan children.	OBJECTIVE: HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART) have both been linked to dyslipidemia and increased cardiovascular disease (CVD). The relationships among the lipidome, immune activation, and subclinical vascular disease in children with perinatally acquired HIV (PHIV) have not been investigated. METHODS: Serum lipid composition, including 13 lipid classes constituting 850 different lipid species were measured by direct infusion-tandem mass spectrometry in samples from 20 ART-treated PHIV and 20 age-matched and sex-matched HIV- Ugandan children. All participants were between 10 and 18 years of age with no other known active infections. PHIVs had HIV-1 RNA level 50 copies/ml or less. In addition, common carotid artery intima--media thickness (IMT), as well as plasma  marker of systemic inflammation (hsCRP, IL6, sTNFRa I), monocyte activation (soluble CD14 and CD163), and T-cell activation (expression of CD38 and HLA-DR on CD4+ and CD8+) were evaluated. RESULTS: Median age (Q1, Q3) of study participants was 13 years (11, 15), 37% were boys, 75% were on an NNRTI-based ART regimen. The concentrations of cholesterol ester, LCER, phosphatidylcholines, and sphingomyelin lipid classes were significantly increased in serum of PHIV compared with HIV (P≤0.04). Biomarkers associated with CVD risk including hsCRP, sCD163, and T-cell activation were directly correlated with lipid species in PHIV (P ≤ 0.04). Contents of free fatty acids including palmitic (16 : 0), stearic (18 : 0), and arachidic acid (20 : 0) were positively correlated with IMT in PHIV. CONCLUSION: Serum lipidome is altered in young virally suppressed PHIV on ART. A  direct association between inflammation and lipid species known to be associated  with CVD was observed.	0
34215158	The association between breast cancer capacity and resources with incidence and mortality in Arizona's low populous counties.	INTRODUCTION: While cancer deaths have decreased nationally, declines have been much slower in rural areas than in urban areas. Previous studies on rural cancer  service capacity are limited to specific points along the cancer care continuum (eg screening, diagnosis or treatment) and require updating to capture the current rural health landscape since implementation of the 2010 Affordable Care Act in the USA. The association between current rural cancer service capacity across the cancer care continuum and cancer incidence and death is unclear. This  cross-sectional study explored the association between breast cancer service capacity and incidence and mortality in Arizona's low populous counties. METHODS: To measure county-level cancer capacity, clinical organizations operating within low populous areas of Arizona were surveyed to assess on-site breast cancer services provided (screening, diagnosis and treatment) and number of healthcare providers were pulled from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services National Provider Identifier database. The number of clinical sites and  healthcare providers were converted to county-level per capita rates. Rural-Urban Continuum codes were used to designate rural or urban county status. Age-adjusted county-level breast cancer incidence and death rates from 2010 to 2016 were obtained from the Arizona Department of Health Services, Arizona Cancer Registry. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the results. Multivariate regression was used to evaluate the association between cancer service capacity and incidence and mortality in 13 out of Arizona's 15 counties. RESULTS: Rural counties had more per capita clinical sites (20.4) than urban counties (8.9) (p=0.02). Urban counties had more per capita pathologists (1.0) than rural counties (0) (p&le;0.01). In addition to zero pathologists, rural counties had zero medical oncologists. Rural county status was associated with a  decrease in breast cancer incidence (&beta;=-20.1, 95% confidence interval: -37.2-3.1). CONCLUSION: While Arizona's sparsely populated rural counties may have more physical infrastructure per capita, these services are dispersed over vast geographic areas. They lack specialists providing cancer services. Non-physician  clinical providers may be more prevalent in rural areas and represent opportunities for improving access to cancer preventive services and care. Compared to urban counties, rural county status was associated with lower detected breast cancer incidence rates although there were no statistically significant differences in breast cancer mortality. Other factors may contribute  to rural-urban differences in breast cancer incidence. Future research should explore these factors and the association between cancer capacity and local resources because the use of county-level data represents a challenge in Arizona, where counties average over 19 425 km2 (7500 square miles).	0
33274542	Tumor Response and Symptom Palliation from RAINBOW, a Phase III Trial of Ramucirumab Plus Paclitaxel in Previously Treated Advanced Gastric Cancer.	BACKGROUND: In the intent-to-treat (ITT) population of the RAINBOW study, objective response rate (ORR) was 28% and 16% in the ramucirumab and control arms, respectively. To further characterize tumor response, we present details on timing and extent of tumor shrinkage, as well as associations with symptom palliation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumor response was assessed with RECIST v1.1, and quality  of life (QoL) was assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) v3.0. Prespecified and post hoc analyses were conducted in the ITT population, patients with measurable disease, or responders, and included best overall response (BOR), ORR, disease control rate (DCR), duration of response, time to response (TtR), change in tumor size, and associations of QoL with tumor shrinkage and BOR. RESULTS: In both treatment arms, median TtR was 1.5 months. Responses were more durable in the ramucirumab versus control arm (median 4.4 vs. 2.8 months). In patients with measurable disease (78% of ITT), ORR was 36% versus 20%; DCR was 81% versus 61% in the ramucirumab versus control arms. Waterfall plots demonstrated more tumor shrinkage in the ramucirumab versus control arm. Regardless of treatment, tumor response and stable disease were associated with improved or stable QoL, with more tumor shrinkage associated with greater symptom palliation. CONCLUSION: Treatment with ramucirumab plus paclitaxel yielded the highest ORR reported to date for patients with previously treated advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Additional details demonstrate robustness of tumor response results. The extent of tumor shrinkage is directly associated with symptom palliation and should be considered when evaluating patient needs and treatment selection. Clinical trial identification number. NCT01170663. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Ramucirumab plus paclitaxel is a recognized standard of care as it improves survival for patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have been previously treated with recommended first-line therapy. These additional data on tumor response demonstrate a positive association between tumor shrinkage and symptom palliation in a patient population that is often symptomatic. These observations included patients with nonmeasurable disease, a group of patients often underrepresented in clinical trials. This knowledge can inform treatment decisions, which align individual patient characteristics and needs with demonstrated benefits.	0
33294026	Steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) lineages and sexes show variable patterns of association of adult migration timing and age-at-maturity traits with two genomic regions.	As life history diversity plays a critical role in supporting the resilience of exploited populations, understanding the genetic basis of those life history variations is important for conservation management. However, effective application requires a robust understanding of the strength and universality of genetic associations. Here, we examine genetic variation of single nucleotide polymorphisms in genomic regions previously associated with migration phenology and age-at-maturity in steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) from the Columbia River. We found chromosome 28 markers (GREB1L, ROCK1 genes) explained significant variance in migration timing in both coastal and inland steelhead. However, strength of association was much greater in coastal than inland steelhead (R 2 0.51 vs. 0.08), suggesting that genomic background and challenging inland migration pathways may act to moderate effects of this region. Further, we found  that chromosome 25 candidate markers (SIX6 gene) were significantly associated with age and size at first return migration for inland steelhead, and this pattern was mediated by sex in a predictable pattern (males R 2 = 0.139-0.170; females R 2 = 0.096-0.111). While this encourages using these candidate regions in predicting life history characteristics, we suggest that stock-specific associations and haplotype frequencies will be useful in guiding implementation of genetic assays to inform management.	0
34305907	Dual-Organ Transcriptomic Analysis of Rainbow Trout Infected With Ichthyophthirius multifiliis Through Co-Expression and Machine Learning.	Ichthyophthirius multifiliis is a major pathogen that causes a high mortality rate in trout farms. However, systemic responses to the pathogen and its interactions with multiple organs during the course of infection have not been well described. In this study, dual-organ transcriptomic responses in the liver and head kidney and hemato-serological indexes were profiled under I. multifiliis infection and recovery to investigate systemic immuno-physiological characteristics. Several strategies for massive transcriptomic interpretation, such as differentially expressed genes (DEGs), Poisson linear discriminant (PLDA), and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) models were used to investigate the featured genes/pathways while minimizing the disadvantages of  individual methods. During the course of infection, 6,097 and 2,931 DEGs were identified in the head kidney and liver, respectively. Markers of protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, oxidative phosphorylation, and the proteasome were highly expressed. Likewise, simultaneous ferroptosis and cellular reconstruction was observed, which is strongly linked to multiple organ dysfunction. In contrast, pathways relevant to cellular replication were up-regulated in only the head kidney, while endocytosis- and phagosome-related pathways were notably expressed in the liver. Moreover, interestingly, most immune-relevant pathways (e.g., leukocyte trans-endothelial migration, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis) were highly activated in the liver, but the same pathways in the head kidney were down-regulated. These conflicting results from different organs suggest that interpretation of co-expression among organs is crucial for profiling of systemic responses during infection. The dual-organ transcriptomics approaches presented in this study will greatly contribute to our understanding of multi-organ interactions under I. multifiliis infection from a broader perspective.	0
34211256	Poor Sleep Hygiene is Associated with Decreased Discrimination and Inattention on Continuous Performance Task in Doctor of Physical Therapy Students: A Cross-sectional Study.	INTRODUCTION: Reduced sleep quality impairs learning, memory formation, attention, and executive function ability. Poor sleep quality or sleep hygiene has been shown to impair academic performance of undergraduate and medical students. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between sleep  quality, sleep hygiene, and cognitive performance in Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) students. METHODS: Fifty DPT students at the University of Kansas Medical Center completed  the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Sleep Hygiene Index (SHI). Cognitive performance was assessed using the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) which is a test of sustained attention and the Trail-Making Task (TMT) to assess  executive functioning. An actigraph was worn for one week to objectively characterize sleep outcomes. Spearman's correlations were performed to assess the association between self-report sleep quality, sleep hygiene, and outcomes on the cognitive tasks. Post-hoc Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted to examine group differences between sleep outcomes and cognitive performance for demographic variable categories. RESULTS: Twenty-three students (46%) reported poor sleep quality, and 27 participants (54%) had objectively-reported poor sleep quality. There was a significant positive correlation between SHI and Detectability (rs= 0.297, p= 0.036) and Omissions (rs=.343, p=0.015). There were group differences between sex and number of pets on the CPT outcomes, and there was a significant group difference between the number of drinks/week categories on the SHI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: About half of the participants were identified as having poor sleep quality. Poorer sleep hygiene was associated with poorer discrimination and inattention, which could potentially impact the students' academic and clinical performance as well as their health and wellbeing. Also, certain demographic variables may modulate the results.	0
34398926	Uptake of oral fluid-based HIV self-testing among men who have sex with men and transgender women in Thailand.	BACKGROUND: Suboptimal uptake of HIV testing remains a primary bottleneck to HIV  prevention and treatment for men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) in Thailand. The World Health Organization has recommended HIV self-testing (HIVST) as an additional strategic HIV service. However, HIVST has not been fully endorsed and implemented in many countries in Southeast Asia. The  aim of this study was to assess the uptake of oral fluid-based HIVST in MSM and TGW populations in Thailand. METHODS: During 2017 and 2018, we conducted a cross-sectional study using convenience sampling to enroll 2,524 participants from three major urban areas. Participants were recruited during outreach and online activities and were offered unassisted or assisted HIVST, or referral to HIV testing services. A descriptive analysis was performed for summarizing data. RESULTS: A total of 2,502 participants (1,422 MSM and 1,082 TGW) were included in the analysis with about one-third (36.1%) of them being first-time testers. Among all participants enrolled in the study, a total of 2,486 participants (99.3%) selected HIVST versus referral to HIV testing services. Of those who selected HIVST, 2,095 (84.3%) opted for assisted HIVST while the rest opted for unassisted HIVST: 1,148 of 1,411 MSM (81.4%) and 947 of 1,075 TGW (88.1%) selected assisted  HIVST. While no serious adverse events were reported during the study, we found that among 179 participants who needed a confirmatory test and were referred to HIV testing services, 108 (60.3.4%) accessed these later services. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a high uptake of oral fluid-based HIVST among MSM and TGW populations in Thailand and that HIVST could be scaled up through the national epidemic control program. However, a better understanding of HIV testing-seeking behavior and innovative follow-up solutions are needed to improve and monitor linkages to services for people who undertake HIVST.	0
33471302	Scoliosis with Chiari I malformation without associated syringomyelia.	PURPOSE: Many patients with presumed idiopathic scoliosis are found to have Chiari I malformation (CM-I) on MRI. The objective of this study is to report on  scoliosis progression in CM-I with no syringomyelia. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients with scoliosis and CM-I was conducted from 1997 to 2015. Patients with syringomyelia and/or non-idiopathic scoliosis were excluded. Clinical and radiographic characteristics were recorded at presentation and latest follow-up. CM-I was defined as the cerebellar tonsil extending 5 mm or more below the foramen magnum on MRI. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (72% female) with a mean age of 11 years (range 1-16) at scoliosis diagnosis were included. The average initial curve was 30.3° ± SD 16.3. The mean initial Chiari size was 9.6 mm SD ± 4.0. Fifteen (46.9%) experienced Chiari-related symptoms, and three (9%) patients underwent Posterior Fossa Decompression (PFD) to treat these symptoms. 10 (31%) patients went on to fusion, progressing on average 13.6° (95% CI 1.6-25.6°). No association was detected between decompression and either curve progression or fusion (p = 0.46, 0.60). For those who did not undergo fusion, curve magnitude progressed on average 1.0° (95% CI - 4.0 to 5.9°). There was no association between age, Chiari size, presence of symptoms, initial curve shape, or bracing treatment and fusion. CONCLUSION: Patients with CM-I and scoliosis may not require surgical treatment,  including PFD and fusion. Scoliosis curvature stabilized in the non-surgical population at an average progression of 1.0°. These results suggest that CM-I with no syringomyelia has minimal effect on scoliosis progression.	0
35432278	Association of Gut Microbiota With Metabolism in Rainbow Trout Under Acute Heat Stress.	Global warming is one of the most common environmental challenges faced by cold-water fish farming. Heat stress seriously affects the feeding, growth, immunity, and disease resistance of fish. These changes are closely related to the destruction of intestinal barrier function, the change of intestinal microbiota, and metabolic dysfunction. However, the causal relationship between the phenotypic effects of heat stress as well as intestinal and metabolic functions of fish is unknown. In the current study, the optimal growth temperature (16°C) of rainbow trout was used as the control group, while the fish treated at 22.5°C, 23.5°C, and 24.5°C for 24 h, respectively, were the treatment  groups. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis showed that with the increase in temperature, the relative abundance and diversity of intestinal microbiota decreased significantly, while the number of Mycoplasma, Firmicutes, and Tenericutes increased significantly. Non-targeted metabolomics analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis and correlation analysis showed that the changes of metabolites related to amino acids, vitamins, and short-chain fatty acids in serum of rainbow trout under acute heat stress were strongly correlated with the decrease of relative abundance of various intestinal microbiota, especially Morganella, Enterobacter, Lactobacillus, Lawsonia, and Cloacibacterium. In addition, we also found that acute heat stress seriously affected the intestinal structure and barrier function, and also caused the pathological damage of epithelial cells. These results indicate that the gut microbiome of acute heat-stressed rainbow trout could mediate metabolite transfer through the gut barrier by affecting its integrity. Significant changes in gut morphology, permeability, antioxidant capacity, and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were observed. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the changes of intestinal microbiota under heat stress to help understand the regulatory mechanism of heat stress and protect the intestinal health of rainbow trout from  the negative effects of rising water temperature.	0
35087734	Clostridioides difficile Infection Is Associated with Adverse Outcomes among Hospitalized Pediatric Patients with Acute Pancreatitis.	PURPOSE: Studies in adults have shown an increasing incidence of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in patients hospitalized with acute pancreatitis (AP).  There is lack of epidemiological data on CDI and its impact on hospitalized pediatric patients with AP. METHODS: We analyzed the National Inpatient Sample and Kids' Inpatient Database between the years 2003 and 2016 and included all patients (age <21 years) with a  primary diagnosis of AP using specific International Classification of Diseases codes. We compared clinical outcomes between children with CDI and those without  CDI. Our primary outcome was severe AP and secondary outcomes included length of  stay and hospital charges. RESULTS: A total of 123,240 hospitalizations related to AP were analyzed and CDI  was noted in 0.6% of the hospital. The prevalence rate of CDI doubled from 0.4% (2003) to 0.8% (2016), p=0.03. AP patients with CDI had increased comorbidities,  and also underwent more invasive surgical procedures, p<0.05. AP patients with CDI had a higher in-hospital mortality rate and increased prevalence of severe AP, p<0.001. Multivariate regression models showed that CDI was associated with 2.4 times (confidence interval [CI]: 1.91 to 3.01, p<0.001) increased odds of severe AP. CDI patients had 7.24 (CI: 6.81 to 7.67, p<0.001) additional hospital  days while incurring $59,032 (CI: 54,050 to 64,014, p<0.001) additional hospitalization charges. CONCLUSION: CDI in pediatric patients with AP is associated with adverse clinical outcomes and increased healthcare resource utilization. Further studies are needed to elucidate this association to prevent the development of CDI and to improve outcomes.	0
34273913	Functional characterization of novel variants in SMPD1 in Indian patients with acid sphingomyelinase deficiency.	Pathogenic variations in SMPD1 lead to acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), that is, Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) type A and B (NPA, NPB), which is a recessive lysosomal storage disease. The knowledge of variant spectrum in Indian patients is crucial for early and accurate NPD diagnosis and genetic counseling of families. In this study, we recruited 40 unrelated pediatric patients manifesting symptoms of ASMD and subnormal ASM enzyme activity. Variations in SMPD1 were studied using Sanger sequencing for all exons, followed by interpretation of variants based on American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics & Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) criteria. We identified 18 previously unreported variants and 21 known variants, including missense, nonsense, deletions, duplications, and splice site variations with disease-causing potential. Eight missense variants were functionally characterized using in silico molecular dynamic simulation and in vitro transient transfection in HEK293T cells, followed by ASM enzyme assay, immunoblot, and immunofluorescence studies. All the variants showed reduced ASM activity in transfected cells confirming their disease-causing potential. The study provides data for efficient prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling of families with NPD type A and B.	0
33811050	Cross-sectional study evaluating the association between integrated care and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in Dutch primary care.	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between integrated care and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in a primary care practice population. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey study. SETTING: Primary care practice population. PARTICIPANTS: A sample (n=5562) of patients in two general practitioner practices in the Netherlands. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The Rainbow Model of Integrated Care Measurement Tool patient version and EQ-5D was used to assess integrated service delivery and HRQOL. The association between integrated care and HRQOL groups was analysed using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall, 933 respondents with a mean age of 62 participated (20% response rate) in this study. The multivariate analysis revealed that positive organisational coordination experiences were linked to better HRQOL (OR=1.87, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.95), and less anxiety and depression problems (OR=0.36, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.63). Unemployment was associated with a poor HRQOL (OR=0.15, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.28). Ageing was associated with more mobility (OR=1.06, 95% CI 1.04 to  1.09), self-care (OR=1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.11), usual activity (OR=1.03, 95% CI  1.01 to 1.05) and pain problems (OR=1.02, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.04). Being married improved the overall HRQOL (OR=1.60, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.26) and decreased anxiety and depression (OR=0.47, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.72). Finally, females had a poor overall HRQOL (OR=1.67, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.93) and more pain and discomfort problems (OR=1.47, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.95). CONCLUSION: This study shows for the first time that organisational coordination  activities are positively associated with HROQL of adult patients in a primary care context, adding to the evidence of an association between integrated care and HRQOL. Also, unemployment, ageing and being female are accumulating risk factors that should be considered when designing integrated primary care programmes. Further research is needed to explore how various integration types relate to HRQOL for people in local communities.	0
35268179	High Polymorphism in the Dmrt2a Gene Is Incompletely Sex-Linked in Spotted Scat,  Scatophagus argus.	Unlike mammals and birds, many fishes have young sex chromosomes, providing excellent models to study sex chromosome differentiation at early stages. Previous studies showed that spotted scat possesses an XX-XY sex determination system. The X has a complete Dmrt3 copy (termed normal) and a truncated copy of Dmrt1 (called Dmrt1b), while the Y has the opposite (normal Dmrt1, which is male-specific, and a truncated Dmrt3 called Dmrt3△-Y). Dmrt1 is the candidate sex determination gene, while the differentiation of other sex-linked genes remains unknown. The spotted scat has proven to be a good model to study the evolution of sex chromosomes in vertebrates. Herein, we sequenced a neighbor gene of this family, Dmrt2, positioned farther from Dmrt1 and closer to Dmrt3 in the spotted scat, and analyzed its sequence variation and expression profiles. The physical locations of the three genes span across an estimated size of &gt;40 kb. The open reading frames of Dmrt2a and its paralog Dmrt2b are 1578 bp and 1311 bp, encoding peptides of 525 and 436 amino acid residues, respectively. Dmrt2a is positioned close to Dmrt3 but farther from Dmrt1 on the same chromosome, while Dmrt2b is not. Sequence analysis revealed several mutations; insertions, and deletions (indels) on Dmrt2a non-coding regions and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  on the Dmrt2a transcript. These indels and SNPs are sex-linked and showed high male heterogeneity but do not affect gene translation. The markers designed to span the mutation sites tested on four different populations showed varied concordance with the genetic sexes. Dmrt2a is transcribed solely in the gonads and gills, while Dmrt2b exists in the gonads, hypothalamus, gills, heart, and spleen. The Dmrt2a and Dmrt2b transcripts are profoundly expressed in the male gonads. Analyses of the transcriptome data from five other fish species (Hainan medaka (Oryzias curvinotus), silver sillago (Sillago sihama), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), Hong Kong catfish (Clarias fuscus), and spot-fin porcupine fish (Diodon hystrix)) revealed testes-biased expression of Dmrt1 in all, similar to spotted scat. Additionally, the expression of Dmrt2a is higher in the testes than the ovaries in spotted scat and Hainan medaka. The Dmrt2a transcript was not altered in the coding regions as found in Dmrt1 and Dmrt3 in spotted scat. This could be due to the functional importance of Dmrt2a in development. Another possibility is that because Dmrt2a is positioned farther from Dmrt1 and the chromosome is still young, meaning it is only a matter of time before it differentiates. This study undeniably will aid in understanding the functional divergence of the sex-linked genes in fish.	0
32539165	Moving Beyond p < 0.05 in Ecotoxicology: A Guide for Practitioners.	"Statistical inferences play a critical role in ecotoxicology. Historically, null  hypothesis significance testing (NHST) has been the dominant method for inference in ecotoxicology. As a brief and informal definition of NHST, researchers compare (or ""test"") an experimental treatment or observation against a hypothesis of no relationship (the ""null hypothesis"") using the collected data to see if the observed values are statistically ""significant"" given predefined error rates. The resulting probability of observing a value equal to or greater than the observed  value assuming the null hypothesis is true is the p value. Criticisms of NHST have existed for almost a century and have recently grown to the point where statisticians, including the American Statistical Association (ASA), have felt the need to clarify the role of NHST and p values beyond their current common use. These limitations also exist in ecotoxicology. For example, a review of the  2010 Environmental Toxicology & Chemistry (ET&C) volume that found many authors did not correctly report p values. We repeated this review looking at the 2019 volume of ET&C. Incorrect reporting of p values still occurred almost a decade later. Problems with NHST and p values highlight the need for statistical inferences besides NHST, something long known in ecotoxicology and the broader scientific and statistical communities. Furthermore, concerns such as these led the executive director of the ASA to recommend against use of ""statistical significance"" in 2019. In light of these criticisms, ecotoxicologists require alternative methods. We describe some alternative methods including confidence intervals, regression analysis, dose-response curves, Bayes factors, survival analysis, and model selection. Lastly, we provide insights for what ecotoxicology might look like in a post-p value world. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;39:1657-1669.  Published 2020.

33791570	Multiple Degrees of Freedom in the Fish Skull and Their Relation to Hydraulic Transport of Prey in Channel Catfish.	Fish perform many complex manipulation behaviors without hands or flexible muscular tongues, instead relying on more than 20 movable skeletal elements in their highly kinetic skulls. How fish use their skulls to accomplish these behaviors, however, remains unclear. Most previous mechanical models have represented the fish skull using one or more planar four-bar linkages, which have just a single degree of freedom (DoF). In contrast, truncated-cone hydrodynamic models have assumed up to five DoFs. In this study, we introduce and validate a 3D mechanical linkage model of a fish skull that incorporates the pectoral girdle and mandibular and hyoid arches. We validate this model using an in vivo motion dataset of suction feeding in channel catfish and then use this model to quantify the DoFs in the fish skull, to categorize the motion patterns of the cranial linkage during feeding, and to evaluate the association between these patterns and food motion. We find that the channel catfish skull functions as a 17-link, five-loop parallel mechanism. Despite having 19 potential DoFs, we find that seven DoFs are sufficient to describe most of the motion of the cranial linkage,  consistent with the fish skull functioning as a multi-DoF, manipulation system. Channel catfish use this linkage to generate three different motion patterns (rostrocaudal wave, caudorostral wave, and compressive wave), each with its own associated food velocity profile. These results suggest that biomechanical manipulation systems must have a minimum number of DoFs to effectively control objects, whether in water or air.	0
34650438	Genistein Inhibits the Pathogenesis of Aeromonas hydrophila by Disrupting Quorum  Sensing Mediated Biofilm Formation and Aerolysin Production.	Aeromonas hydrophila is an opportunistic pathogen that is responsible for a variety of infectious diseases both in human and animals, particularly aquatic animals. Moreover, the pathogen has become a foodborne pathogen by transmitting from seafood to human. The abuse of antibiotics in aquaculture results in the emergence of antibiotic resistance and treatment failure. Therefore, novel approaches are urgently needed for managing resistant A. hydrophila associated infections. Aerolysin, an essential virulence factor of pathogenic A. hydrophila  strain, has been identified as target developing novel drugs against pathogenesis of A. hydrophila. In the present study, genistein, without anti-A. hydrophila activity, was identified that could decrease the production of aerolysin and biofilm formation at a dose-dependent manner. Transcription of aerolysin encoding gene aerA and quorum sensing related genes ahyI and ahyR was significantly down-regulated when co-cultured with genistein. Cell viability studies demonstrated that genistein could significantly improve aerolysin mediated A549 cell injury. Furthermore, genistein could provide a remarkable protection to channel catfish infected with A. hydrophila. These findings indicate that targeting quorum sensing and virulence can be a useful approach developing drugs  against A. hydrophila infections in aquaculture. Moreover, genistein can be chosen as a promising candidate in developing drugs against A. hydrophila.	0
32771347	The coordinated outcome of STIM1-Orai1 and superoxide signalling is crucial for headkidney macrophage apoptosis and clearance of Mycobacterium fortuitum.	The mechanisms underlying M. fortuitum-induced pathogenesis remains elusive. Using headkidney macrophages (HKM) from Clarias gariepinus, we report that TLR-2-mediated internalization of M. fortuitum is imperative to the induction of  pathogenic effects. Inhibiting TLR-2 signalling alleviated HKM apoptosis, thereby favouring bacterial survival. Additionally, TLR-2-mediated cytosolic calcium (Ca2+)c elevation was instrumental for eliciting ER-stress in infected HKM. ER-stress triggered the activation of membrane-proximal calcium entry channels comprising stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and calcium-release activated calcium channel 1 (Orai1). RNAi studies suggested STIM1-Orai1 signalling initiate calpain-mediated cleavage of nitric oxide synthase interacting protein, prompting the release of pro-apoptotic nitric oxide. Inhibiting STIM1-Orai1 signalling attenuated superoxide production (O2•-) and vice versa. We conclude, TLR-2-induced ER-stress triggers STIM1/Orai1 expression and that the reciprocal association between STIM1-Orai1 signalling and oxidative stress is critical for sustaining (Ca2+)c level, thereby prolonging ER-stress and maintenance of pro-oxidant rich environment to induce HKM apoptosis and bacterial clearance.	0
34636005	Hepatic nodular alterations in wild fish from a hyper-eutrophic freshwater system with cyanobacterial blooms: a species and seasonal comparison.	This paper reports on the seasonal and species comparison of hepatic nodular alterations in two indicator fish species from the hyper-eutrophic Roodeplaat Dam in South Africa. This freshwater system is characterized by seasonal cyanobacterial algal blooms which release bio-toxins, including hepato-toxins, which can have negative effects on the health of the resident fish population. A  total of 115 Clarias gariepinus (Burchell) and 98 Oreochromis mossambicus (Peters) were collected seasonally across six different surveys over a period of  3 years. Nodular alterations in livers were assessed both macroscopically and microscopically. We found a species difference with a 48% prevalence of nodular alterations in C. gariepinus and no macroscopically visible alterations in O. mossambicus. Affected fish also showed an increase in the ratio of liver mass to  body mass, i.e., the hepatosomatic index. The microscopic characteristics of the  nodules were primarily associated with pre-neoplastic, focal areas of cellular alterations; most prevalent were focal areas of steatosis. However, we could not  establish a seasonal pattern regarding the occurrence of these alterations and therefore no association between the occurrence of the liver pathology and the cyanobacterial blooms. Our results therefore suggest that the occurrence of nodular alterations is not an acute, seasonal response, but rather a chronic, and possibly, and more interestingly, a species-specific, pathological response.	0
33537518	Genetic Variability Comparison of Wild and Cultured Far Eastern Catfish (Silurus  asotus) of Korea using Microsatellite Marker.	The Far Eastern catfish (Silurus asotus) is an important commercial freshwater fish in Korea. Investigation of the genetic diversity of wild and cultured domestic catfish groups is essential for the restoration of fishery resources and for increasing local revenue. However, there are relatively few genetic diversity studies on wild and cultured catfish in Korea. In the present study, we analyzed  the genetic diversity and association of wild and cultured catfish using five microsatellite markers. We determined that the number of alleles per locus (NA )  ranged from 9 to 25, wherein the Jeonbuk catfish demonstrated the highest mean number of alleles per locus and the cultured catfish exhibited the lowest. The average expected heterozygosity (He) of the wild catfish samples was 0.907, and that of the cultured catfish showed was 0.875. The genetic distances (GD value) among populations of all catfish ranged from 0.138 to 0.242. Jeonnam and Jeonbuk  wild catfish were located closest to each other, and the cultured group was separated from the other groups. In conclusion, the present study confirmed that  the genetic diversity of wild and cultured catfish was maintained at a high level. In the case of the wild group, it is effective in maintaining diversity due to the continuous fry release by the local fish research institute. However,  the genetic diversity of cultured catfish declined. Low diversity is associated with slow growth and weakened immunity, and therefore continuous monitoring is necessary.	0
33285164	Immunogenicity study of OmpU subunit vaccine against Vibrio mimicus in yellow catfish, Pelteobagrus fulvidraco.	The outer membrane protein U (OmpU) is a conserved outer membrane protein in a variety of pathogenic Vibrio species and has been considered as a vital protective antigen for vaccine development. Vibrio mimicus (V. mimicus) is the pathogen causing ascites disease in aquatic animals. In this study, the prokaryotically expressed and purified His-tagged OmpU of V. mimicus (His-OmpU) was used as a subunit vaccine. The formalin inactivated V. mimicus, purified His  tag (His-tag), and PBS were used as controls. The vaccinated yellow catfish were  challenged with V. mimicus at 28 days post-vaccination, and the results showed that the His-OmpU and inactivated V. mimicus groups exhibited much higher survival rates than the His-tag and PBS groups. To fully understand the underlying mechanism, we detected the expression levels of several immune-related genes in the spleen of fish at 28 days post-vaccination and 24 h post-challenge.  The results showed that most of the detected immune-related genes were significantly upregulated in His-OmpU and inactivated V. mimicus groups. In addition, we performed the serum bactericidal activity assay, and the results showed that the serum from His-OmpU and inactivated V. mimicus groups exhibited much stronger bactericidal activity against V. mimicus than those of His-tag and  PBS groups. Finally, the serum agglutination antibody was detected, and the antibody could be detected in His-OmpU and inactivated V. mimicus groups with the antibody titers increasing along with the time post-vaccination, but not in His-tag or PBS group. Our data reveal that the recombinant OmpU elicits potent protective immune response and is an effective vaccine candidate against V. mimicus in yellow catfish.	0
33552125	Comparative Transcriptome Analysis During the Seven Developmental Stages of Channel Catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and Tra Catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) Provides Novel Insights for Terrestrial Adaptation.	Tra catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus), also known as striped catfish, is a facultative air-breather that uses its swim bladder as an air-breathing organ (ABO). A related species in the same order (Siluriformes), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), does not possess an ABO and thus cannot breathe in the air. Tra and channel catfish serve as great comparative models for investigating  possible genetic underpinnings of aquatic to land transitions, as well as for understanding genes that are crucial for the development of the swim bladder and  the function of air-breathing in tra catfish. In this study, hypoxia challenge and microtomy experiments collectively revealed critical time points for the development of the air-breathing function and swim bladder in tra catfish. Seven  developmental stages in tra catfish were selected for RNA-seq analysis based on their transition to a stage that could live at 0 ppm oxygen. More than 587 million sequencing clean reads were generated, and a total of 21,448 unique genes were detected. A comparative genomic analysis between channel catfish and tra catfish revealed 76 genes that were present in tra catfish, but absent from channel catfish. In order to further narrow down the list of these candidate genes, gene expression analysis was performed for these tra catfish-specific genes. Fourteen genes were inferred to be important for air-breathing. Of these,  HRG, GRP, and CX3CL1 were identified to be the most likely genes related to air-breathing ability in tra catfish. This study provides a foundational data resource for functional genomic studies in air-breathing function in tra catfish  and sheds light on the adaptation of aquatic organisms to the terrestrial environment.	0
35291838	Identification of sex chromosome and sex-determining gene of southern catfish (Silurus meridionalis) based on XX, XY and YY genome sequencing.	Teleosts are important models to study sex chromosomes and sex-determining (SD) genes because they present a variety of sex determination systems. Here, we used  Nanopore and Hi-C technologies to generate a high-contiguity chromosome-level genome assembly of a YY southern catfish (Silurus meridionalis). The assembly is  750.0 Mb long, with contig N50 of 15.96 Mb and scaffold N50 of 27.22 Mb. We also  sequenced and assembled an XY male genome with a size of 727.2 Mb and contig N50  of 13.69 Mb. We identified a candidate SD gene through comparisons to our previous assembly of an XX individual. By resequencing male and female pools, we  characterized a 2.38 Mb sex-determining region (SDR) on Chr24. Analysis of read coverage and comparison of the X and Y chromosome sequences showed a Y specific insertion (approx. 500 kb) in the SDR which contained a male-specific duplicate of amhr2 (named amhr2y). amhr2y and amhr2 shared high-nucleotide identity (81.0%) in the coding region but extremely low identity in the promotor and intron regions. The exclusive expression in the male gonadal primordium and loss-of-function inducing male to female sex reversal confirmed the role of amhr2y in male sex determination. Our study provides a new example of amhr2 as the SD gene in fish and sheds light on the convergent evolution of the duplication of AMH/AMHR2 pathway members underlying the evolution of sex determination in different fish lineages.	0
33680422	Management Practices, Farmers' Knowledge of Diseased Fish, and Their Occurrence in Fish Farms in Nyeri County, Kenya.	In this study, fish farmers' management practices, occurrence, and knowledge of fish diseases in Nyeri County, Kenya, were evaluated. Fish farming management practices for small-scale farmers in Kenya have numerous challenges which have led to disease occurrence and reduced production. Moreover, the impact and association of these challenges to farmers' knowledge of fish diseases and their  burden has not been fully studied. A semistructured questionnaire was used to capture farmers' biodata, fish species farmed, and farmers' management practices  such as handling of nets, pond fertilization, and disposal of fish waste. Farmers' knowledge of fish diseases was based on their ability to identify independent and dependent variable indicators. Independent variables included clinical signs, decreased feeding, bulging eyes, floating on water, abdominal swelling, bulging eyes, abnormal skin color, reduced growth, and abnormal swimming with fish death as were the dependent variable. A total of 208 farmers were interviewed and included those of tilapia (134), mixed tilapia and catfish (40), catfish (22), rainbow trout, and five dams under cooperative management. Tilapia was the most kept fish species (66.8%) followed by polyculture of tilapia and catfish (20%) and rainbow trout (2%). Most respondents were male (78.5%) over 51 years of age (50%). Fifty percent of the respondents had secondary school education. There was a significant association between deaths and sharing of nets in Kieni East subcounty (p=0.0049, chi-square), while on-farm fish waste disposing appeared to cause higher deaths compared to burning of the waste although not statistically significant (p=0.13). Few respondents observed decreased feed uptake (<20%) and poor growth. Fifty-seven percent of farmers reported mortalities. Fish poor growth, floating in water, and management practices in subcounties had significant effect on fish deaths. The farmers had knowledge of signs of diseased fish, but there was paucity of knowing the specific causes of disease. Farmers need to be empowered on best aquaculture husbandry to avoid disease transmission and specific fish disease signs to enhance proper reporting of disease for subsequent mitigation measures.	0
33366454	The first complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the korean endemic catfish Silurus microdorsalis (Actinopteri, Siluriformes, Siluridae).	The Silurus microdorsalis is known as Korean endemic slender catfish. Despite its value as a biological resource, there is no complete mitochondrial genome sequence. The complete mitochondrial genome consisted of 16,524 bp including 22 transfer RNA (tRNAs), 2 ribosomal RNA (rRNAs), 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), and A + T rich region. The overall base composition of S. microdorsalis was A + T: 56.1%, C + G: 43.9%, apparently with slight AT bias. Phylogenetic relationship showed that S. microdorsalis was closely related to Silurus glanis.	0
33275944	Phylogenetic reconstruction of early diverging tapeworms (Cestoda: Caryophyllidea) reveals ancient radiations in vertebrate hosts and biogeographic  regions.	Tapeworms of the order Caryophyllidea are the earliest diverging 'true' tapeworms (Eucestoda) and parasitise cypriniform and siluriform fishes almost exclusively.  They are typified by a monozoic (non-proglottised) body plan, which is a characteristic shared with early diverging 'cestodarians' Gyrocotylidea and Amphilinidea. Here we present the most comprehensive multi-gene molecular phylogeny of this group, to date. Specimens of 63 species from 32 genera (~50% and ~75% of known species and genus diversity, respectively) were gathered during an intense and targeted 15-year collecting effort. Phylogenetic reconstructions provide high nodal support for three major lineages, which only partly correspond to currently recognised families. The three well-supported clades were as follows: Clade A was in an unsupported position at the base of the tree and was almost exclusively comprised of parasites of catfishes (Siluriformes) from the Afrotropical and Indomalayan regions, including the type genus of the Lytocestidae (Lytocestus). Clade B formed the sister group to the remaining taxa  (Clade C) and was composed of species that parasitise cyprinids and loaches (Cypriniformes: Cyprinoidei and Cobitoidei) from the Palaearctic Region. This clade included the type genus of the Caryophyllaeidae (Caryophyllaeus). Clade C comprised Nearctic species from suckers and minnows (Cypriniformes: Catostomidae  and Cyprinoidei), which were previously accommodated in two families, i.e. Capingentidae and Caryophyllaeidae. This clade included the type genus of the Capingentidae (Capingens). In addition to Clades A-C, Balanotaenia bancrofti from the monotypic Balanotaeniidae, which parasitises plotosid catfishes in Australia, and Lytocestoides tanganyikae, which parasitises African cichlids, formed a poorly supported clade at the base of the tree. Whereas morphological characteristics traditionally used to differentiate caryophyllidean families do not characterise molecular lineages, host association and biogeographical distribution play a key role in the circumscription of the three well-supported clades revealed by molecular data. Thus, the taxonomic rearrangement proposed herein was guided by the molecular clades. The names of all four extant families  were preserved and family affinity was determined by topological clustering with  the type genera of the families. The family diagnoses of the Lytocestidae, Caryophyllaeidae and Capingentidae are amended. Biogeographic patterns are indicative of separate Gondwanan and Laurasian radiations having taken place. Regarding the Gondwanan radiation in the Siluriformes, the topology in Clade A indicates an Asian origin with a subsequent African colonisation. Concerning Laurasia, separate radiations appear to have taken place in the Cypriniformes in  the temperate zones of North America and Eurasia. Complete absence of caryophyllideans in the Neotropical Region, where numerous catfishes occur, may be due to the Gondwanan radiation having taken place after the continental separation of Africa and South America.	0
33829356	Cloning, characterization, and transcriptional activity of β-actin promoter of African catfish (Clarias gariepinus).	"Selection of suitable promoters is crucial for the efficient expression of exogenous genes in transgenic animals. Although one of the most effective promoters, the β-actin promoter, has been widely studied in fish species, it still remains unknown in the economical important African catfish (Clarias gariepinus). In this study, the β-actin promoter of African catfish (cgβ-actinP)  was cloned and characterized. In addition, recombinant plasmid pcgβ-actinP-EGFP with enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene as the reporter gene was constructed to verify the transcriptional activity. We obtained a cgβ-actinP fragment length of 1405 bp, consisting 104 bp of the 5' proximal promoter, 96 bp  of the first exon, and 1205 bp of the first intron. Similar to those of other fish species, cgβ-actinP contains three key transcription regulatory elements (CAAT box, CArG motif, and TATA box). GFP-specific fluorescent signals were detected in chicken embryonic fibroblasts cells (DF-1 cells) transfected with pcgβ-actinP-EGFP, which was approximately 1.11 times of the positive control. In  addition, GFP was effectively expressed in zebrafish larvae microinjected with linearized cgβ-actinP-EGFP, with expression rate reaching approximately 49.84%. Our data indicate that cgβ-actinP could be a potential candidate promoter in the  practice of constructing ""all fish"" transgenic fish."	0
35166964	Allelically and Differentially Expressed Genes After Infection of Edwardsiella ictaluri in Channel Catfish as Determined by Bulk Segregant RNA-Seq.	Identification of genetic markers associated with resistance against enteric septicemia of catfish (ESC) is of great interest for genetic enhancement programs of catfish. In the present study, bulk segregant RNA-Seq analysis was applied to  determine differentially expressed genes and alleles after ESC infection. Here we report three genomic regions on LG1, LG12, and LG26, containing significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These genomic regions aligned well with quantitative trait loci (QTL) previously identified. Within the QTL regions, eleven genes were found to be differentially regulated between phenotypic bulks.  Importantly, the QTL on linkage group 1 (LG1) were found to be expressed in the liver, whereas the QTL on LG12 and LG26 were expressed in the intestine, suggesting multiple mechanisms of ESC resistance. It is apparent that apolipoproteins may be important for ESC resistance as the QTL on LG1 included the 14-kDa apolipoprotein genes that are both allelically expressed and differentially expressed between the resistant and susceptible bulks. Traf2 and NCK-interacting protein kinase (TNIK) were found in the QTL on LG12, and it was downregulated in resistant fish, suggesting the importance of NCK downregulation  in ESC resistance, as previously reported. In addition, we observed divergent gene expression patterns between the liver and intestine after infection. Immune/inflammatory-related processes were overrepresented from liver DEGs, while those DEGs identified from intestine were enriched for proteolysis and wounding processes. Taken together, the BSR-Seq analysis presented here advanced the knowledge of ESC resistance, providing information of not only positions of QTL but also genes and their differential expression between resistant and susceptible fish, making it one step closer to the identification of the causal genes for ESC resistance.	0
32649095	Treatment of an Abscess of the Leg in a Febrile Child After Incidental Trauma from the Barb of a Freshwater Fish: A Case Report.	CASE: A 9-year-old boy suffered incidental trauma to the anterolateral leg from the barb of a freshwater fish. Within a few days of injury, the patient developed a fever and a deep abscess despite empiric antibiotic therapy. The underlying pathogen was Edwardsiella tarda. This study is the first report of such an abscess in a child, and similar reported cases have in adults have been associated with high rates of mortality. CONCLUSION: Penetrating soft-tissue trauma in association with an aquatic environment requires prompt evaluation. Empiric antibiotic regimens effective against terrestrial cellulitis may lack adequate gram-negative coverage for aquatically related injuries.	0
34607243	Effects of moderate exercise on hepatic amino acid and fatty acid composition, liver transcriptome, and intestinal microbiota in channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus).	Previous research on swimming exercise in fish has focused on muscle building and quality of flesh. However, the effects of hepatic amino acid and fatty acid composition, liver gene expression profile, and intestinal microbiota are poorly  understood. In this study, channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) were subjected to a 4-week swimming exercise, and liver transcriptome and intestinal microbiota  analyses were performed to broaden our understanding of fish under exercise. When compared to non-exercised channel catfish (N-EXF), exercised channel catfish (EXF) had improved arachidonic acid (C20:4n6; ARA), docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n3; DHA), aspartic acid (Asp) and glycine (Gly). The liver transcriptome analysis revealed 2912 differentially expressed genes and numerous enriched signaling pathways including those involved in nutrient synthesis, such as biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and amino acids; glucose metabolism, such as glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, insulin signaling, and AMPK signaling pathways; and oxygen transport, such as HIF-1, PI3K-Akt, and MAPK signaling pathways. In addition, bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing data revealed that long-term exercise increased bacterial diversity and richness, and changed the intestinal microbial composition in channel catfish. In summary, this study provides insights into hepatic metabolic pathways, candidate genes, and intestinal microbiota underlying the long-term exercised channel catfish.	0
33028208	A high-density SNP-based genetic map and several economic traits-related loci in  Pelteobagrus vachelli.	BACKGROUND: A high-density genetic linkage map is essential for QTL fine mapping, comparative genome analysis, identification of candidate genes and marker-assisted selection in aquaculture species. Pelteobagrus vachelli is a very popular commercial species in Asia. However, some specific characters hindered achievement of the traditional selective breeding based on phenotypes, such as lack of large-scale genomic resource and short of markers tightly associated with growth, sex determination and hypoxia tolerance related traits. RESULTS: By making use of 5059 ddRAD markers in P. vachelli, a high-resolution genetic linkage map was successfully constructed. The map' length was 4047.01 cM  by using an interval of 0.11 cm, which is an average marker standard. Comparative genome mapping revealed that a high proportion (83.2%) of markers with a one-to-one correspondence were observed between P. vachelli and P. fulvidraco. Based on the genetic map, 8 significant genome-wide QTLs for 4 weight, 1 body proportion, 2 sex determination, and 1 hypoxia tolerance related traits were detected on 4 LGs. Some SNPs from these significant genome-wide QTLs were observably associated with these phenotypic traits in other individuals by Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR. In addition, two candidate genes for weight, Sipa1 and HSD11B2, were differentially expressed between fast-, medium- and slow-growing P. vachelli. Sema7a, associated with hypoxia tolerance, was induced  after hypoxia exposure and reoxygenation. CONCLUSIONS: We mapped a set of suggestive and significant QTLs as well as candidate genes for 12 growth, 1 sex determination and 1 hypoxia tolerance related traits based on a high-density genetic linkage map by making use of SNP markers for P. fulvidraco. Our results have offered a valuable method about the much more efficient production of all-male, fast growth and hypoxia tolerance P.  vachelli for the aquaculture industry.	0
33474020	The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Liobagrus mediadiposalis (Teleostei, Siluriformes, Amblycipitidae).	The south torrent catfish Liobagrus mediadiposalis (Teleostei, Siluriformes, Amblycipitidae) is an endemic species of Korea. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence consisted of 16,534 base pairs (bp) encoding 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and two non-coding regions. The overall base composition of L. mediadiposalis was G + C: 44.8%, A + T: 55.2%, apparently with a slight AT bias. Phylogenetic analysis showed that L. mediadiposalis was closely related to Liobagrus reinii.	0
35049086	Diversity, host specificity and biogeography in the Cladocorynidae (Hydrozoa, Capitata), with description of a new genus.	The hydrozoan family Cladocorynidae inhabits tropical to temperate waters and comprises the two genera Pteroclava and Cladocoryne. Pteroclava lives in association with some octocorals and hydrozoans, whereas Cladocoryne is more generalist in terms of substrate choice. This work provides a thorough morpho-molecular reassessment of the Cladocorynidae by presenting the first well-supported phylogeny of the family based on the analyses of three mitochondrial and four nuclear markers. Notably, the two nominal genera were confirmed to be monophyletic and both morphological and genetic data led to the formal description of a new genus exclusively associated with octocorals, Pseudozanclea gen. nov. Maggioni & Montano. Accordingly, the diagnosis of the family was updated. The ancestral state reconstruction of selected characters revealed that the symbiosis with octocorals likely appeared in the most recent common ancestor of Pteroclava and Pseudozanclea. Additionally, the presence of euryteles aggregation in the polyp stage and the exumbrellar nematocyst pouches with euryteles represent synapomorphies of all cladocorynid taxa and probably emerged in their most recent common ancestor. The analysis of several Pteroclava  krempfi colonies from Indo-Pacific and Caribbean localities associated with several host octocorals revealed a high intra-specific genetic variability. Single- and multi-locus species delimitations resulted in three to five species hypotheses, but the statistical analysis of morphometric data showed only limited distinction among the clades of P. krempfi. However, P. krempfi clades showed differences in both host specificity, mostly at the octocoral family level, and geographic distribution, with one clade found exclusively in the Caribbean Sea and the others found in the Indo-Pacific.	0
34802624	Potential Impacts of Body Image Perception in Female Equestrians.	Female body image (BI) has been investigated in many sports yet, in female-dominated equestrianism, there is a paucity of BI research. This study aimed to identify self-perceptions of BI, rider perceptions of judge and coach bias, relationships between BI and self-consciousness and effect of breast size.  A four-part, 27 question survey (GoogleForms) was completed by female equestrians (n = 493). The second smallest BI was considered ideal for equestrianism (χ2 = 352.751, P < .001) regardless of age, own BI or level of riding commitment. There was a perception judges favor riders with smaller frames (χ2 = 54.2111, P < .001) and an association between riders with a larger BI feeling self-conscious when riding (χ2 = 87.514, P < .001). More respondents perceived the ideal equestrian BI to be smaller than theirs (Median = -1.5, W = 7777.00, P < .001) and an association between those dissatisfied with their BI and self-consciousness when riding was seen (χ2 = 83.649, P < .001). Perception of the ideal equestrian frame is smaller than many riders' own BI, and a larger BI perception negatively impacts self-confidence, potentially hindering performance  and participation. Female riders with a larger frame feel they are perceived negatively by judges and further study is indicated to investigate the extent of  this potential bias on subjective judging in equestrian disciplines.	0
34894442	In vitro motions of the medial and lateral proximal sesamoid bones under mid-stance load conditions are consistent with racehorse fracture configurations.	Proximal sesamoid bone (PSB) fractures in racehorses are likely fatigue fractures that occur due to repetitive loads and stress remodeling. The loading circumstances that may induce damage in the PSBs are not well understood. The goal of this study was to determine in three-dimensions, PSB motions relative to  the opposing metacarpal condyle during simulated mid-stance loads. Seven equine cadaveric forelimbs were axially loaded in a material testing system to simulate  standing and mid-stance walk, trot, and gallop load conditions (1.8-10.5 kN). Joint angles were determined by tracking the positions of bone-fixed kinematic markers. Internal-external rotation, abduction-adduction, and flexion-extension of each PSB relative to the third metacarpal condyle were compared between loads  and between PSBs using an ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer post hoc tests for pairwise comparisons. The medial PSB rotated externally and the lateral PSB apex abducted  during limb loading. Medial PSB external rotation was significantly greater at the gallop load condition than at the walk or trot load conditions. The medial and lateral PSB motions observed in this study are consistent with location of fatigue damage and fracture configurations frequently seen in medial and lateral  PSBs from Thoroughbred racehorses. Specifically, medial PSB external rotation is  consistent with the development of an abaxial subchondral medial PSB lesion that  is reported in association with medial PSB transverse fracture and lateral PSB abduction is consistent with axial longitudinal fracture of the lateral PSB.	0
35257378	Professional stereotypes among specialties and fields of work within the veterinary community.	BACKGROUND: Medical specialties hold varying degrees of prestige, stemming from the existence of stereotypes among them. These have been shown to lead to prejudice against specific specialists, which not only influences career choices  but also affects the perception of equality among specialties. METHOD: The aim of the research was to determine the presence of stereotypes in the UK veterinary community. Using an online questionnaire, participants were asked to provide an adjective that best characterises 15 specialties, in addition to their perceptions on prestige and gender association. Word cloud analysis coupled with sentiment analysis in Python using the language processing software  Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) was used to assess sentiments with respect to the adjectives. RESULTS: There were 665 questionnaire respondents, and there was evidence of their construction of specialty-specific stereotypes. Some specialties were perceived more negatively than others, including equine general practitioners, surgeons, pathologists, dermatologists and public health veterinarians/epidemiologists. Gender bias was identified within this study, most prominently within production animal and behavioural medicine veterinarians. The  most prestigious specialties were neurology, surgery and cardiology. CONCLUSION: Specialty-specific stereotypes exist within the veterinary community. Acknowledging their existence is a first step to recognising the influence they have on career choices.	0
34578268	Prevalence of Nasal Shedding of Equid Gammaherpesviruses in Healthy Swiss Horses.	Equid Gamma herpesvirus (eGHV) infections have been reported worldwide and may be correlated with clinical signs, e.g., affecting the respiratory tract in young horses. eGHV are shed by healthy horses as well as horses with respiratory tract  disease. The prevalence in healthy Swiss horses is unknown to date but this data  would provide valuable information for causal diagnosis in clinical cases and formulation of biosecurity recommendations. Nasal swabs from 68 healthy horses from 12 Swiss stables and 2 stables near the Swiss border region in Germany were  analyzed by panherpes nested PCR. Positive samples were sequenced. A multivariable model was used to determine if sex, age, breed, canton, or stable had a significant effect on the shedding status of each detected eGHV. Overall, the eGHV prevalence was 59% (n = 68); the prevalence for equid herpesvirus-2 (EHV-2), equid herpesvirus-5 (EHV-5) and asinine herpesvirus-5 (AHV-5) was 38%, 12% and 9%, respectively. Co-infections with multiple eGHVs were observed in 25%  of the positive samples. The odds of shedding EHV-2 decreased with age (p = 0.01) whereas the odds of shedding AHV-5 increased with age (p = 0.04). Breed, sex, canton, or stable had no significant association with eGHV shedding. As EHV-2 shedding was common in healthy horses a positive PCR result must be interpreted with caution regarding the formulation of biosecurity recommendations and causal  diagnosis. As EHV-5 and AHV-5 shedding was less common than EHV-2, a positive test result is more likely to be of clinical relevance. Shedding of multiple eGHV complicates the interpretation of positive test results in a horse.	0
35136578	Risk factors, hematological and biochemical profile associated with colic in Delman horses in Gresik, Indonesia.	Background: Horses are herd animals that have been domesticated in the last century. In several countries, an overview of risk factors and clinical evaluation in horses with colic has not been well-described. This study aimed to  evaluate risk factors and hematological profiles in horses associated with colic  in Gresik, East Java, Indonesia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed during April - October 2019. A total of 115 horses were diagnosed based on physical examination, clinical symptoms, and rectal examination. A questionnaire  was asked to the horse-owners to analyze the risk factors while the clinical examination was performed and blood samples were collected for pre-treatment and  14 days post-treatment. Hematological profile was evaluated from a whole blood sample. Serum cortisol, plasma epinephrine, and norepinephrine concentrations were also evaluated after separating the aliquots.  Results: Of the 115 horses, 96 were diagnosed with colic. The horses with colic showed a significant association between cases with gender (p<0.021), breed (p<0.000), wheat bran feeding (p<0.015), concentrate feeding (p<0.003), anthelmintics administration (p<0.000), gastrointestinal parasites (p<0.000), dental diseases (p<0.024), previous exposure to colic (p<0.000), body condition score (p<0.000), and access  to water per day (p<0.000). Based on whole blood and serum evaluation, there were ameliorated significantly on the hematological profile (p<0.01), serum cortisol (p<0.05), and plasma epinephrine (p<0.01) at 14 days post-treatment. Conclusion:  This study has identified factors associated with colic in Delman horses. The study provides crucial information to investigate cases of colic and to contribute the development of healthcare strategies during treatment and clinical evaluation.	0
34945242	The Association between Bisphenol A, Steroid Hormones, and Selected MicroRNAs Levels in Seminal Plasma of Men with Infertility.	Bisphenol A (BPA), the most common endocrine-disrupting chemical, has been associated with male reproductive dysfunctions. Recently, it has been shown that  BPA may also affect miRNAs expression. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the association of BPA levels with steroid hormone concentration and circulating miRNAs levels to investigate the potential direct effect of BPA on homeostasis in the testis environment. The level of BPA in the seminal plasma of azoospermic men was significantly higher compared to the healthy control. The concentrations of estradiol (E2) and androstenedione (A) were significantly decreased in the seminal plasma of azoospermic men compared to the normospermic men. The levels of miR-let-7a, miR-let-7b, and miR-let-7c were significantly up-regulated, and the level of miR-518f was significantly down-regulated in the seminal plasma of the azoospermic men compared to the healthy control. The level of BPA correlated negatively with sperm concentration and normal semen morphology. A significant positive correlation was found between BPA levels and miR-let-7a and miR-let-7c levels, whereas BPA negatively correlated with miR-518f levels. Our results suggest that BPA may negatively affect sperm quality. Moreover, BPA correlated with the miR-let-7a, miR-let-7c, and miR-518f levels in seminal plasma, which suggests that BPA may act directly in seminal plasma, affecting the testicular environment.	0
34944194	Association of Equine Herpesvirus 5 with Mild Respiratory Disease in a Survey of  EHV1, -2, -4 and -5 in 407 Australian Horses.	Equine herpesviruses (EHVs) are common respiratory pathogens in horses; whilst the alphaherpesviruses are better understood, the clinical importance of the gammaherpesviruses remains undetermined. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of, and any association between, equine respiratory herpesviruses EHV1, -2, -4 and -5 infection in horses with and without clinical signs of respiratory disease. Nasal swabs were collected from 407 horses in Victoria and included clinically normal horses that had been screened for regulatory purposes. Samples were collected from horses during Australia's equine influenza outbreak in 2007; however, horses in Victoria required testing for proof of freedom from EIV. All horses tested in Victoria were negative for EIV, hence archived swabs were available to screen for other pathogens such as EHVs. Quantitative PCR techniques were used to detect EHVs. Of the 407 horses sampled, 249 (61%) were clinically normal, 120 (29%) presented with clinical signs consistent with mild respiratory disease and 38 (9%) horses had an unknown clinical history. Of the three horses detected shedding EHV1, and the five shedding EHV4, only one was noted to have clinical signs referable to respiratory disease. The proportion of  EHV5-infected horses in the diseased group (85/120, 70.8%) was significantly greater than those not showing signs of disease (137/249, 55%). The odds of EHV5-positive horses demonstrating clinical signs of respiratory disease were twice that of EHV5-negative horses (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.16). No quantitative difference between mean loads of EHV shedding between diseased and non-diseased horses was detected. The clinical significance of respiratory gammaherpesvirus infections in horses remains to be determined; however, this survey adds to the mounting body of evidence associating EHV5 with equine respiratory disease.	0
35264835	Relationship between Osteoporosis, Multiple Fractures, and Egg Intake in Healthy  Elderly.	Context: The role of dietary patterns in the prevention of osteoporosis has been  investigated in many studies, but few have examined the association between consumption of specific food and whole-body (WB) bone mineral density (BMD). Recent evidence suggests that whole eggs contain bioactive compounds that could have beneficial effects on BMD. BMD is also expressed as the T-score, which is used for the clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis and to evaluate the effectiveness of drugs. Aims: We conducted a study to assess the association between eggs consumption and bone density in a population of the elderly. Settings and Design: This cross-sectional study included 176 individuals of both  genders and aged ≥65 years. Subjects and Methods: Egg intake was ascertained by a combination of dietary intake assessment, and a dual X-ray absorptiometry scan was performed to measure  WB T-score. Results: In our study, among all the food groups and nondietary factors evaluated, we find a positive association between the WB T-score and egg consumption (B = 0.02; P = 0.02), gender (B = 0.85; P < 0.001), and body mass index (B = 0.04; P = 0.03). Multiple fractures were associated with the daily intake of eggs (B = ‒0.26; P = 0.02) and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (B  = 0.09; P = 0.03). Conclusions: This study provides novel evidence of a positive link between whole  egg consumption and bone health. If results observed in this study will be confirmed through future randomized controlled trials, whole eggs may represent a viable strategy to prevent osteoporosis and reduce the risk of fractures in the elderly.	0
35011793	The Prevalence of Atopy in Biologically Treated Spondyloarthropathies: A Retrospective Study of 200 Patients.	(1) Background: Recent data shed light on the association between atopic disorders (ADs) (atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis) and spondyloarthropathies (SpAs), underpinning the critical role of T helper (Th)1-Th17/Th2-T regulatory cells disbalance. We evaluated the prevalence of AD in axial SpAs (axSpAs) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and explored the potential association between atopic status, disease-related parameters, and biological therapy. (2) Methods: A monocentric, retrospective study was conducted that enrolled 200 patients taking biologics. Demographics, disease, and drug-related variables, along with a screening questionnaire focused on Ads, were systematically collected. (3) Results: Overall, 51 patients (25.5%) had atopy-namely, 24.4% of axSpA and 28% of PsA, with a higher frequency of rhinitis  (43%) vs. atopic dermatitis (37.2%) or asthma (21.5%). We failed to demonstrate any statistically significant difference in demographics, SpA-related parameters  excepting concomitant inflammatory bowel disease, and biologic drug exposure in patients with and without atopy (p > 0.05). However, significantly more non-atopic patients need only one TNF inhibitor (54%) vs. atopic patients (28%) (p < 0.05) to control active SpA. (4) Conclusions: We successfully demonstrated that AD is associated with one out of four SpA. Irrespective of the SpA subtype,  atopic patients require more frequent switching among biologics, as significantly more non-atopic patients remain on their first anti-TNF.	0
35023992	Arthroscopic guided repair of a slab fracture of the fourth carpal bone in an 8-month-old thoroughbred horse.	An 8-month-old thoroughbred colt presented with sudden onset right forelimb lameness. A radiographic series of the right carpus was performed, and it revealed a slab fracture of the fourth carpal bone and fracture of the proximal part of the third metacarpal bone. Arthroscopically guided repair of the slab fracture of the fourth carpal bone with a 3.5 mm cortex screw and lag screw fixation of the fracture of the proximal part of the third metacarpal bone were performed. The horse started to race at 32 months old and started in 65 races over three years without any trouble associated with the right carpus.	0
35146012	The Gingiva of Horses With Pituitary Pars Intermedia Dysfunction: A Macroscopic Anatomical Evaluation.	Pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) is a common neurodegenerative disease mainly in horses older than 15 years. The domestic equine population is following the same demographic change as that seen in humans; it is aging and veterinarians are asked to attend to geriatric horses more frequently. Common problems seen regularly in older equines are dental disorders and especially periodontal disease. As a systemic and endocrine disease, associated with delayed wound healing and impaired immune function, PPID should be considered before major dental treatment in aged equines is started. Possible negative effects of PPID on epithelial tissues could also affect the periodontium. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify gross changes in the gingiva associated with PPID. Fourteen horses with clinical signs of PPID and adenoma in the pituitary pars intermedia and 13 controls showing neither clinical signs nor PPID-associated histological changes in the pituitary gland were included. PPID-affected horses (26.9 ± 0.73 years) were significantly older than controls (20.0 ± 1.24 years). In the PPID-affected group, significantly more often an irregular and bulky appearance of the gingival texture was observed, as well as an irregular shape of the gingival margin. Furthermore, the sulcus gingivalis of  cheek teeth frequently was deeper than 1 mm. These findings indicate a possible association between age, soft tissue alterations, and PPID and suggest a potential predisposition of PPID-affected horses for periodontal diseases.	0
34679946	Genomic Regions Associated with the Position and Number of Hair Whorls in Horses.	The position and number of hair whorls have been associated with the behavior, temperament, and laterality of horses. The easy observation of whorls assists in  the prediction of reactivity, and thus permits the development of better measures of handling, training, mounting, and riding horses. However, little is known about the genetics involved in the formation of hair whorls. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform a genome-wide association analysis to identify chromosome regions and candidate genes associated with hair whorl traits. Data from 342 Quarter Horses genotyped for approximately 53,000 SNPs were used in an association study using a single-step procedure. The following traits were analyzed: vertical position of hair whorl on the head, number of whorls on the head, and number of whorls on the left and right sides of the neck. The traits had between one and three genomic windows associated. Each of them explained at least 4% of the additive variance. The windows accounted for 20-80% of additive variance for each trait analyzed. Many of the prospected genes are related to hair follicle growth. Some of these genes exert a pleiotropic effect on neurological and behavioral traits. This is the first indication of biological and physiological activity that might explain the association of hair whorls and  temperament.	0
34889527	Moderate-intensity training in hypoxia improves exercise performance and glycolytic capacity of skeletal muscle in horses.	We investigated whether moderate-intensity training of horses in moderate hypoxia for 4 weeks elicits greater adaptations in exercise performance, aerobic capacity, and glycolytic/oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscle compared to normoxic training. In a randomized crossover study design, seven untrained Thoroughbred horses (5.9 ± 1.1 years, 508 ± 9 kg) completed 4 weeks (3 sessions/week) of two training protocols consisting of 3-min cantering at 70%  of maximal oxygen consumption ( V ˙ O 2 max ) in hypoxia (HYP; FI O2  = 14.7%) and normoxia (NOR; FI O2  = 21.0%) with a 4-month washout period. Normoxic incremental exercise tests (IET) were conducted before and after training. Biopsy samples were obtained from the middle gluteal muscle before IET and monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) protein expression and glycolytic/mitochondrial enzyme activities were analyzed. Data were analyzed using mixed models (p < 0.05). Running speed was 7.9 ± 0.2 m/s in both groups and arterial oxygen saturation during training in NOR and HYP were 92.9 ± 0.9% and 75.7 ± 3.9%, respectively. Run time in HYP (+9.7%) and V ˙ O 2 max in both groups (NOR, +6.4%; HYP, +4.3%) at IET increased after 4 weeks of training. However, cardiac output,  arterial-mixed venous O2 difference, and hemoglobin concentration at exhaustion were unchanged in both conditions. While MCT1 protein and citrate synthase activity did not increase in both conditions after training, MCT4 protein (+13%), and phosphofructokinase activity (+42%) increased only in HYP. In conclusion, 4 weeks of moderate-intensity hypoxic training improves exercise performance and  glycolytic capacity of skeletal muscle in horses.	0
35197083	Concordance between the schedule for the evaluation of individual quality of life-direct weighting (SEIQoL-DW) and the EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D) measures of quality  of life outcomes in adults with X-linked hypophosphatemia.	BACKGROUND: Accurate measurement of any constructs in clinical studies is of critical importance, especially if the adoption of an intervention relies on detecting a significant treatment effect where one exists. Under Neutral theory,  the amount of relevant and irrelevant indicators selected to operationalise the construct contribute equally to the accuracy of the observation. The Neutral or accurate observation is achieved by observing all relevant indicators only. Generic QoL instruments such as EQ-5D are increasingly being accepted as imprecise, especially in rare diseases, based on the relevance of their indicators. QoL is a construct that embodies a patient's subjectivity, individuality, and local circumstances at measurement. SEIQoL-DW is an instrument designed to respect these characteristics of QoL through eliciting indicators or  cues directly from the subject along with the proportion of the overall QoL they  contribute. EQ-5D and SEIQoL can therefore be considered as being at opposing ends of accuracy in QoL measurement. XLH is a hereditary, progressive, rare disease characterised by phosphate wasting, affecting both children and adults and impacting their QoL. The purpose of this study was to observe if any change in QoL of adult XLH patients were detectable using EQ-5D, SEIQoL eliciting new cues at each visit, and SEIQoL administering baseline cues overall visits (thereby silencing its time-dependency) versus baseline over 12 months. In addition, any association between the three sets of observations was explored. RESULTS: All quality of life scores were observed to decrease from baseline by 13.36%, 7.32% and 2.7% based on SEIQoLvisit_cues, SEIQoLbaseline_cues, and EQ-5D  assessments, respectively. The decrease in the quality of life scores was only statistically significant (p = 0.037) for SEIQoLvisit_cues. Beyond the baseline visit, the only highly positive and statistically significant pairwise association was between SEIQoLvisit_cues and SEIQoLbaseline_cues at M6 (ρ = 0.782, P value < 0.05) and M9 (ρ = 0.879, P value < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: EQ-5D and SEIQoLbaseline_cues failed to detect the same statistically significant decrease in QoL observed by SEIQoLvisit_cues. Both sets of SEIQoL observations were more closely associated with each other than with EQ-5D. Observing constructs such as QoL in rare diseases benefit from a Neutrality in indicator selection and respecting variation in dominance of various indicators over time.	0
35456409	Genome-Wide Detection of Copy Number Variants in Chinese Indigenous Horse Breeds  and Verification of CNV-Overlapped Genes Related to Heat Adaptation of the Jinjiang Horse.	In the present study, genome-wide CNVs were detected in a total of 301 samples from 10 Chinese indigenous horse breeds using the Illumina Equine SNP70 Bead Array, and the candidate genes related to adaptability to high temperature and humidity in Jinjiang horses were identified and validated. We determined a total  of 577 CNVs ranging in size from 1.06 Kb to 2023.07 Kb on the 31 pairs of autosomes. By aggregating the overlapping CNVs for each breed, a total of 495 CNVRs were detected in the 10 Chinese horse breeds. As many as 211 breed-specific CNVRs were determined, of which 64 were found in the Jinjiang horse population. By removing repetitive CNV regions between breeds, a total of 239 CNVRs were identified in the Chinese indigenous horse breeds including 102 losses, 133 gains and 4 of both events (losses and gains in the same region), in which 131 CNVRs were novel and only detected in the present study compared with previous studies. The total detected CNVR length was 41.74 Mb, accounting for 1.83% of the total length of equine autosomal chromosomes. The coverage of CNVRs on each chromosome  varied from 0.47% to 15.68%, with the highest coverage on ECA 12, but the highest number of CNVRs was detected on ECA1 and ECA24. A total of 229 genes overlapping  with CNVRs were detected in the Jinjiang horse population, which is an indigenous horse breed unique to the southeastern coast of China exhibiting adaptability to  high temperature and humidity. The functional annotation of these genes showed significant relation to cellular heat acclimation and immunity. The expression levels of the candidate genes were validated by heat shock treatment of various durations on fibroblasts of horses. The results show that the expression levels of HSPA1A were significantly increased among the different heat shock durations.  The expression level of NFKBIA and SOCS4 declined from the beginning of heat shock to 2 h after heat shock and then showed a gradual increase until it reached the highest value at 6 h and 10 h of heat shock, respectively. Breed-specific CNVRs of Chinese indigenous horse breeds were revealed in the present study, and  the results facilitate mapping CNVs on the whole genome and also provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of adaptation to high temperature and humidity in the Jinjiang horse.	0
35252415	Fine-Scale Analysis of Runs of Homozygosity Islands Affecting Fertility in Mares.	"The loss of genetic variability in livestock populations bred under strict selection processes is a growing concern, as it may lead to increased inbreeding  values and lower fertility, as a consequence of the ""inbreeding depression"" effect. This is particularly important in horses, where inbreeding levels tend to rise as individuals become more and more closely related. In this study, we evaluated the effect of increased inbreeding levels on mare fertility by combining an SNP-based genomic approach using runs of homozygosity and the estimation of genetic breeding values for reproductive traits in a large population of Pura Raza Española mares. Our results showed a negative correlation between whole-genome homozygosity and fertility estimated breeding values (EBVs)  at the genome level (ρ = -0.144). However, the analysis at chromosome level revealed a wide variability, with some chromosomes showing higher correlations than others. Interestingly, the correlation was stronger (-0.241) when we repeated the analysis in a reduced dataset including the 10% most and least fertile individuals, where the latter showed an increase in average inbreeding values (FROH) of around 30%. We also found 41 genomic regions (ROHi, runs of homozygosity islands) where homozygosity increased 100-fold, 13 of which were significantly associated with fertility after cross-validation. These regions encompassed 17 candidate genes previously related to oocyte and embryo development in several species. Overall, we demonstrated the relationship between increased homozygosis at the genomic level and fertility in mares. Our findings may help to deal with the occurrence of inbreeding depression, as well as further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying fertility in mares."	0
34839288	Low Concentration of Fecal Valeric Acid at 1 Year of Age Is Linked with Eczema and Food Allergy at 13 Years of Age: Findings from a Swedish Birth Cohort.	BACKGROUND: Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are abundant bacterial metabolites in the gut, with immunomodulatory properties. Hence, they may influence allergy development. Previous studies have linked fecal SCFA pattern during infancy with  allergy. However, the association of SCFAs to allergic outcomes in adolescence is not well established. Here, we examined how the fecal SCFA pattern at 1 year of age related to allergy at 13 years of age. METHODS: Levels of 8 SCFAs in fecal samples collected at 1 year of age from 110 children were quantified using gas chromatography. The same individuals were evaluated at 13 years of age for allergic symptoms, allergy diagnosis and allergy medication by questionnaire, and for sensitization using skin prick test against  egg, milk, fish, wheat and soy, cat, dog, horse, birch, and timothy grass. RESULTS: The concentration of fecal valeric acid at 1 year of age was inversely associated with eczema at 13 years of age (OR 0.6, 95% CI: 0.4-1.0, p = 0.049) and showed a trend for inverse association with food allergy at 13 years of age (OR 0.6, 95% CI: 0.4-1.0, p = 0.057). In a sub-group analysis of children with eczema at 1 year of age, a higher concentration of fecal valeric acid was linked  with reduced risk of their eczema remaining at 13 years of age (OR 0.2, 95% CI: 0.0-1.5), although this latter analysis did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.12). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings lend further support to the notion of early childhood as a critical period when allergy may be programmed via the gut microbiota. Higher levels of fecal valeric acid may be characteristic of a protective gut microbiota and/or actively contribute to protection from eczema and food allergy.	0
35229298	Incidence of carpal fractures and risk factors for recurrent fractures after arthroscopic removal of carpal chip fracture fragments in Thoroughbred racehorses.	BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the recent incidence of carpal fractures and  the risk factors for recurrent ipsilateral fractures after arthroscopic removal of clinically active unilateral carpal chip fracture fragments in Thoroughbred racehorses. METHODS: The findings for horses managed under the Japan Racing Association that  developed carpal bone fractures between 2014 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The proportion of cases that developed a recurrent carpal fracture in the originally affected joint was calculated, and the risk factors for recurrent  fractures were analysed. RESULTS: In total, 2858 carpal fractures were recorded in the study period (incidence, 0.8%). Of the 554 horses that resumed racing after the treatment of the unilateral major carpal chip fracture, 144 had a recurrent fracture (26.0%).  Chip fractures of the third carpal bone (odds ratio [OR]: 3.7) or a combination of the distal end of the radius and intermediate carpal bone (OR: 3.0) were associated with a significantly higher risk of recurrent fractures than the distal aspect of the radial carpal bone. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of carpal fractures remained similar to that reported  in Japan in the 1990s. The rate of recurrent ipsilateral fractures differed among lesion sites.	0
35335029	Equids' Core Vaccines Guidelines in North America: Considerations and Prospective.	Vaccination against infectious diseases is a cornerstone of veterinary medicine in the prevention of disease transmission, illness severity, and often death in animals. In North American equine medicine, equine vaccines protecting against tetanus, rabies, Eastern and Western equine encephalomyelitis, and West Nile are  core vaccines as these have been classified as having a heightened risk of mortality, infectiousness, and endemic status. Some guidelines differ from the label of vaccines, to improve the protection of patients or to decrease the unnecessary administration to reduce potential side effects. In North America, resources for the equine practitioners are available on the American Association  of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) website. Conversely, in small companion animals, peer review materials are regularly published in open access journals to guide the vaccination of dogs and cats. The aims of this review are to present how the  vaccine guidelines have been established for small companion animals and horses in North America, to review the equine literature to solidify or contrast the current AAEP guidelines of core vaccines, and to suggest future research directions in the equine vaccine field considering small companion animal strategies and the current available resources in equine literature.	0
35409830	Reliability of a Qualitative Instrument to Assess High-Risk Mechanisms during a 90° Change of Direction in Female Football Players.	Sidestep cuts between 60° and 180° and one-leg landings have been identified as the main mechanisms of ACL injuries in several sports. This study sought to determine intra- and inter-rater reliability of a qualitative tool to assess high-risk movements in a 90° change of direction when the test is applied in a real framework of sport practice. Female footballers from two teams (n = 38) participated in this study and were asked to perform 90° cutting trials to each side, which were simultaneously filmed from a frontal and a sagittal view. A total of 61 cases were selected for 2D qualitative observational analysis by three raters. Poor reliability was found among each pair of raters as well as moderate reliability when the Cutting Movement Assessment Score (CMAS) was given  by the same rater at different moments, but with too high a minimum detectable change. On the other hand, raters presented a significant, as well as moderate-to-good intra-rater reliability for most items of the CMAS tool. There was, however, non-significant reliability between observers in rating most check-points of the tool. For these reasons, more objective guidelines and clearer definitions for each criterion within the CMAS, as well as a longer, standardised training period for novel observers, would be highly recommended to  improve the reliability of this tool in an applied context with female footballers.	0
34973367	Outside the Classroom: An Evaluation of Equine Internships.	Equine internships provide real experiences for students but are lightly researched. This study explored student perceptions of equine internships. The hypothesis was, participants would report that equine internships were valuable and relate value with compensation, skill acquisition, networking, and job offers. An online survey examined respondents' perceived value of their internship. Of 228 respondents, 186 met the inclusion criteria. Data were examined using frequency counts, correlations, and chi-square measures of association. Breeding internships (29%) were most common, with western training and performance (18%) second highest. Fifty-three percent had an internship requirement for their undergraduate degree; this did not affect internship value. Internship value tended to be higher when housing (X2(4, N = 180) =9.2; P = .075) or compensation (X2(4, N = 180) =8.5; P = .057) were included and highest with both included X2(12, N = 180) = 25.5; P = .013). Most (90%) believed their internship added to their classroom experience; 71% felt academically prepared. Respondents gained equine-related skills (81%), soft skills (83%), customer relations (63%), business management (51%), and administrative skills (33%). Of respondents, 67% use skills gained during their internship in their current job,  and 83% were able to network within the equine industry. Half of internships resulted in a job offer from that company or in their area of interest. Overall,  91% of the respondents felt their internship was valuable, and 87% would recommend their internship to others. Perceived internship value positively correlated with networking (R = 0.75; P < .0001), gaining equine skills (R = 0.49; P < .0001), and job offers (R = 0.24; P < .002). These results suggest that equine internships are positive experiences and valuable for students.	0
34549280	Ethnic differences in risk of severe Covid-19: To what extent are they driven by  exposure?	BACKGROUND: This study quantifies the risk of Covid-19 among ethnic groups of healthcare staff during the first pandemic wave in England. METHODS: We analysed data on 959 356 employees employed by 191 National Health Service trusts during 1 January 2019 to 31 July 2020, comparing rates of Covid-19 sickness absence in different ethnic groups. RESULTS: In comparison with White ethnic groups, the risk of short-duration Covid-19 sickness absence was modestly elevated in South Asian but not Black groups. However, all Black and ethnic minority groups were at higher risk of prolonged Covid-19 sickness absence. Odds ratios (ORs) relative to White ethnicity were more than doubled in South Asian groups (Indian OR 2.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.36-2.63; Pakistani OR 2.38, 2.15-2.64; Bangladeshi OR  2.38, 1.98-2.86), while that for Black African ethnicity was 1.82 (1.71-1.93). In nursing/midwifery staff, the association of ethnicity with prolonged Covid-19 sickness absence was strong; the odds of South Asian nurses/midwives having a prolonged episode of Covid-19 sickness absence were increased 3-fold (OR 3.05, 2.82-3.30). CONCLUSIONS: Residual differences in risk of short term Covid-19 sickness absences among ethnic groups may reflect differences in non-occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Our results indicate ethnic differences in vulnerability to Covid-19, which may be only partly explained by medical comorbidities.	0
35164972	World association for the advancement of veterinary parasitology (WAAVP): Third edition of guideline for evaluating the efficacy of equine anthelmintics.	This guideline have been developed to assist in the design, execution, and interpretation of studies to assess the efficacy of anthelmintic drugs against internal parasites of equines, including nematodes, cestodes, and larval instars  of Gasterophilus spp. The design and execution of critical and controlled studies are outlined, and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Unique considerations for specific target parasites are included. Information is also provided on selection of animals, procedures for randomization, housing, feeding, dosage titration, dosage confirmation and field studies, record keeping and necropsy procedures. Finally, this document includes guidance for group size determination and statistical analysis of study results. This guideline should assist investigators in the evaluation of anthelmintic drugs in horses by using comparable and standardized procedures in studies with appropriate numbers of animals.	0
35023990	Design and storage stability of reference materials for microfluidic quantitative PCR-based equine gene doping tests.	One method of gene doping in horseracing is administering of exogenous genetic materials, known as transgenes. Several polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods have been developed for detecting transgenes with high sensitivity and specificity. However, novel designs for reference materials (RMs) and/or positive template controls (PTCs) are necessary for simultaneous analysis of multiple transgene targets. In this study, we designed and developed a novel RM for simultaneously detecting multiple targets via microfluidic quantitative PCR (MFQPCR). Twelve equine genes were selected as targets in this study. A sequence  region including primers and probes for quantitative PCR was designed, and a 10 bp sequence was inserted to allow the RM to be distinguished from the original transgene sequences. The sequences of individual detection sites were then connected for 12 genes and cloned into a single plasmid vector. We performed fragment size analysis to distinguish between the PCR products of the original transgene sequence and those of the RM, enabling identification of RM contamination. PTCs diluted to 10,000, 1,000, 100, and 10 copies/µl with horse genomic DNA from RM were stably stored at 4°C for 1 year. As digital PCR enabled  absolute quantification, the designed substances can serve as an RM. These findings indicate that the RM design and storage conditions were suitable for gene doping tests using MFQPCR.	0
34732605	High prevalence of Mycoplasma equirhinis in Thoroughbred horses with respiratory  symptoms in autumn 2018.	Mycoplasma species are often isolated from horses with respiratory symptoms; however, the pathogenicity of Mycoplasma is still unclear. In autumn of 2018, we  encountered an increase in cases with respiratory symptoms, mainly coughing, in a group of Thoroughbred racehorses in Japan. We examined tracheal wash samples obtained from 40 of those cases. Bacteria and viruses that commonly cause respiratory symptoms were investigated, and anaerobes were detected in only 5 cases and Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (S. zooepidemicus) was detected in only 1 case of 40 cases with loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay. S.  zooepidemicus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were isolated at a bacterial count of  higher than 1.0 × 104 CFU/ml from 5 and 2 cases of 28 cases cultured, respectively. None of the viruses investigated was detected in 40 cases. Mycoplasma equirhinis (M. equirhinis) was isolated from 40.0% (16/40) of the cases, which was higher than previously reported isolation rates. The rate of M.  equirhinis isolation in the cases from 2018 was significantly higher than the isolation rates in the other horses: clinical cases with respiratory symptoms in  2019-2020 (13.6%, 3/22) and healthy horses (13.5%, 5/37) in Japan. In this study, the isolation rate of M. equirhinis from horse group with cough symptoms in 2018  was high and no other common etiological agents were detected. The pathogenesis of M. equirhinis is still unclear, however, M. equirhinis might have been associated with respiratory symptoms in the Thoroughbred horse cases in 2018.	0
35379180	The gut bacterial microbiome of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) from lakes across an altitudinal gradient.	BACKGROUND: Microorganisms inhabiting the gut play a significant role in supporting fundamental physiological processes of the host, which contributes to  their survival in varied environments. Several studies have shown that altitude affects the composition and diversity of intestinal microbial communities in terrestrial animals. However, little is known about the impact of altitude on the gut microbiota of aquatic animals. The current study examined the variations in the gut microbiota of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) from four lakes along  an altitudinal gradient in Ethiopia by using 16S rDNA Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing. RESULTS: The results indicated that low-altitude samples typically displayed greater alpha diversity. The results of principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) showed significant differences across samples from different lakes. Firmicutes was the most abundant phylum in the Lake Awassa and Lake Chamo samples whereas Fusobacteriota was the dominant phylum in samples from Lake Hashengie and Lake Tana. The ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidota in the high-altitude sample (Lake Hashengie, altitude 2440 m) was much higher than the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidota in the low altitude population (Lake Chamo, altitude 1235 m). We found that the relative abundances of Actinobacteriota, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, and Firmicutes were negatively correlated with altitude, while Fusobacteriota showed a positive association with altitude. Despite variability in the abundance of the gut microbiota across the lakes, some shared bacterial communities were detected. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this study showed the indirect influence of altitude on  gut microbiota. Altitude has the potential to modulate the gut microbiota composition and diversity of Nile tilapia. Future work will be needed to elucidate the functional significance of gut microbiota variations based on the geographical environment. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our study determined the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota in Nile tilapia collected from lakes across an altitude gradient. Our findings greatly extend the baseline knowledge of fish gut microbiota in Ethiopian lakes that plays an important role in this species sustainable aquaculture activities and conservation.	0
34949471	Fractional Flow Reserve in End-Stage Liver Disease.	Fractional flow reserve (FFR) determines the functional significance of epicardial stenoses assuming negligible venous pressure (Pv) and microvascular resistance. However, these assumptions may be invalid in end-stage liver disease  (ESLD) because of fluctuating Pv and vasodilation. Accordingly, all patients with ESLD who underwent right-sided cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography with FFR as part of their orthotopic liver transplantation evaluation between 2013 and 2018 were included in the present study. Resting mean distal coronary pressure (Pd)/mean aortic pressure (Pa), FFR, and Pv were measured. FFR accounting for Pv (FFR - Pv) was defined as (Pd - Pv)/(Pa - Pv). The hyperemic effect of adenosine was defined as resting Pd/Pa - FFR. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 1 year. In 42 patients with ESLD, 49 stenoses were interrogated by FFR (90% were <70% diameter stenosis). Overall, the median model  for ESLD score was 16.5 (10.8 to 25.5), FFR was 0.87 (0.81 to 0.94), Pv was 8 mm  Hg (4 to 14), FFR-Pv was 0.86 (0.80 to 0.94), and hyperemic effect of adenosine was 0.06 (0.02 to 0.08). FFR-Pv led to the reclassification of 1 stenosis as functionally significant. There was no significant correlation between the median model for ESLD score and the hyperemic effect of adenosine (R = 0.10). At 1 year, 13 patients had died (92% noncardiac in etiology), and patients with FFR ≤0.80 had significantly higher all-cause mortality (73% vs 17%, p = 0.001. In conclusion, in patients with ESLD who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation  evaluation, Pv has minimal impact on FFR, and the hyperemic effect of adenosine is preserved. Furthermore, even in patients with the predominantly angiographically-intermediate disease, FFR ≤0.80 was an independent predictor of  all-cause mortality.	0
35012724	Evaluation of risk factors affecting strongylid egg shedding on Hungarian horse farms.	In Hungary, equine parasite control is mostly based on traditional approaches involving rotational anthelmintic treatment at regular intervals. Almost no farms utilize fecal egg counts (FECs) on a regular basis to guide deworming treatments. This approach is certainly not sustainable and is the major factor responsible for the current high levels of anthelmintic resistance. The aims of this study were to statistically analyze risk factors associated with strongylid egg count magnitude and prevalence. Fecal samples and horse data (age, pasture history, stocking density, anthelmintic history) were collected from 216 horses on 13 farms in Pest county, Hungary, during the spring of 2020. FECs were determined by Mini-FLOTAC. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association of  factors with pre-deworming strongylid egg counts. The data were highly overdispersed with approximately 22% (95% Confidence Interval: 17-28%) of the equids shedding 80% of the total strongylid egg output. Strongylid FECs were significantly associated with the age of equids and anthelmintic class used prior to the study. Equids younger than 5 years of age had significantly higher FECs compared to equids in the 5-17-year age range (p = 0.003) and compared to equids  aged >17 years (p < 0.001). Equids treated regularly with benzimidazoles had significantly higher FECs than equids with no history of benzimidazole use (p = 0.02). We found that FECs of horses kept at extremely high stocking density  (>30 horses/ha) were significantly higher than those kept at low (1-2 horses/ha;  p < 0.001) or medium (3-10 horses/ha, p < 0.001) stocking densities. The results  demonstrate the value of FEC monitoring and indicate that the efficacy of benzimidazoles should be investigated in Hungary. Moreover our findings demonstrate that reducing stocking density should be considered in cases of high  strongylid FECs.	0
35158551	Part II of Finnish Agility Dog Survey: Agility-Related Injuries and Risk Factors  for Injury in Competition-Level Agility Dogs.	Dog agility is associated with a risk for sport-related injuries, but few risk factors for injury are known. A retrospective online questionnaire was used to collect data on 864 Finnish competition-level agility dogs-including 119 dogs (14%) with agility-related injury during 2019. Data included injury details, health background, experience in agility, and sport and management routines prior to the injury. Risk factors for injury were evaluated with multivariate logistic  regression. The rate of competition-related injuries was 1.44 injuries/1000 competition runs. The front limb was injured in 61% of dogs. In 65% of dogs, the  injury presented as lameness. The main risk factors for agility-related injury during 2019 were multiple previous agility-related injuries (OR 11.36; 95% CI 6.10-21.13), older age when starting course-like training (OR 2.04 per one year increase; 95% CI 1.36-3.05), high training frequency, diagnosis of lumbosacral transitional vertebra, and physiotherapy every two to three months compared with  never. The most important protective factors were moderate competition frequency  and A-frame performance technique. These associations do not confirm causality. We identified new risk factors for injury in agility. This information can be used to improve the welfare of agility dogs.	0
34557248	Prevalence, Intensity and Risks Involved in Helminth Infections in Domestic Mountain Pony and Balkan Donkey in Nature Park Stara Planina, Serbia.	BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, intensity and risk factors (age and gender) promoting the intestinal helminthic infections of the Domestic mountain ponies and Balkan donkeys in Serbia. METHODS: Prevalence, intensity and risk factors influencing helminth infection in horses (n=39) and donkeys (n=18) at the site of Nature Park Stara Planina, were studied from May to Sep 2015. The presence of one or several gastrointestinal helminth species was confirmed by faecal flotation in 97.43% of horses and 88.88% of donkeys included in the monitoring. The identified helminth species were Trichostrongylus axei, Strongylus edentatus, S. vulgaris, Parascaris equorum, Dictyocaulus arnfieldi and Anoplocephala magna in 84.61%, 46.15%, 5.13%, 58.97%,  94.87% and 38.46% of horses, respectively. The significant association of infection with P. equorum and sex of horses was established. (χ2=13.33, P<0.01). RESULTS: The prevalence of parasitic helminths identified in donkeys was the following: D. arnfieldi, T. axei, Pa. equorum, S. vulgaris, A. margna and Strongyloides westeri in 55.55%, 38.89%, 27.78%, 22.22% and 22.22% of donkeys, respectively. Moreover, the mean faecal egg count was higher in donkeys (369.9 EPG - egg per gram) than in horses (250.2 EPG). The association between the age and the mean EPG was significant (P<0.05) in both equine species. CONCLUSION: The results of the investigation provided basic information that can  be helpful for planning strategic control of nematode infection in equine population in Nature Reserves in Serbia.	0
34691328	Change in Invasively Measured Mean Pulmonary Artery Pressure After Transcatheter  Mitral Valve Repair Is Associated With Heart Failure Readmission.	BACKGROUND: Pre-existing pulmonary hypertension is associated with poor outcomes  after transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVr) for mitral regurgitation (MR). However, the impact of an immediate change in mean pulmonary artery pressure (ΔmPAP) following TMVr on outcomes is unknown. METHODS: Patients who underwent TMVr from December 2015 to February 18, 2020 at our institution for symptomatic 3-4+ MR and who had invasive hemodynamics measured immediately pre- and post-TMVR were included. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to examine the association of ΔmPAP (post-TMVr  - pre-TMVr mPAP) with the primary endpoint of heart failure (HF) readmission at 1 year. Secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality and the composite endpoint of HF readmission or all-cause mortality at 1 year. RESULTS: Among 55 patients, 55% were men, mean age was 72 ± 14.2 years, and mean  ΔmPAP was -1.4 ± 8.2 mm Hg. Overall, HF readmission occurred in 14 (25%), death in 10 (18%), and the composite endpoint in 20 (36%) patients. In multivariable analyses, higher ΔmPAP was significantly associated with HF readmission (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00 - 1.21; P = 0.04). ΔmPAP was not associated with death (HR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.96 - 1.14; P = 0.33), though  there was a numerical but statistically non-significant trend towards the composite endpoint (HR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.00 - 1.13; P = 0.06) driven by HF readmission. CONCLUSION: Higher ΔmPAP immediately following TMVr was associated with increased HF readmission at 1 year. Larger prospective studies are needed to validate these data and further explore the utility of ΔmPAP as a novel hemodynamic parameter to predict post-TMVR outcomes.	0
35333753	Good prognosis for survival to hospital discharge in a group of horses with uterine prolapse treated at a veterinary medical teaching hospital.	OBJECTIVE: To describe uterine prolapse, predispositions, and outcomes in mares treated between 1988 and 2019. ANIMALS: 24 mares with uterine prolapse. PROCEDURES: Clinical records were retrospectively reviewed, and follow-up information was gathered. The Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher exact test were used to analyze results for history and outcome variables for potential association with mare survival to hospital discharge. The χ2 test was used to compare breed distribution. RESULTS: Age was known in 23 mares (median, 11.1 years). For 15 mares with exact  known parity, the median parity was 3 births (range, 1 to 13 births). For 22 mares, the maiden status was known (7 [32%] maiden; 15 [68%] multiparous). Breed  distribution differed significantly between mares with uterine prolapse and all mares treated at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital. Arabians were overrepresented in the uterine prolapse group (7/24 [29%]), compared with all mares treated (4,174/44,474 [9%]). Uterine prolapse occurred within 2 hours after parturition for 10 of 11 mares with known foaling times, after dystocia for 7 mares, and after abortion for 4 mares. Seventeen of 23 (74%) mares survived to hospital discharge. Acute hemorrhage was the most frequent cause of death. There  were no correlations between mare survival to hospital discharge and mare parity  or age, foal sex, retained fetal membranes, sepsis, or maiden status. Colts were  overrepresented in foals with a known sex (12/17). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results indicated a breed predisposition to uterine prolapse, with Arabian mares overrepresented among affected mares. No characteristics correlated with mare survival to hospital discharge.	0
34642100	Demographic, preoperative and anaesthesia-related risk factors for unsatisfactory recovery quality in horses undergoing emergency abdominal surgery.	OBJECTIVE: To determine demographic, preoperative and anaesthesia-related variables that may be associated with unsatisfactory recovery quality in horses undergoing emergency abdominal surgery (colic) in an equine teaching hospital. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: A total of 313 horses. METHODS: The anaesthetic records of horses admitted for surgical treatment of colic between 2005 and 2018 were examined. Overall quality of recovery was assessed as dangerous, poor, fair, good or excellent. The following categories were constructed as a dichotomic variable: unsatisfactory recovery (poor and dangerous recoveries) and satisfactory recovery (excellent, good and fair recoveries). Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to evaluate the association between all studied variables and recovery. RESULTS: All recoveries were unassisted. Unsatisfactory recovery quality totalled 17.2% (3.5% and 13.7% were dangerous and poor recoveries, respectively), whereas  satisfactory recoveries totalled 82.8% (26.2%, 40.9% and 15.7% were fair, good and excellent recoveries, respectively). Univariable analysis showed that unsatisfactory recoveries were associated with high preoperative packed cell volume, pain behaviour, poor premedication and induction quality, high intraoperative mean heart rate, low mean arterial blood pressure, dobutamine dose ≥1.5 μg kg-1 minute-1, non-administration of romifidine, long anaesthesia time and prolonged time to stand. The multivariable model showed that factors strongly associated with unsatisfactory recovery quality were dobutamine dose ≥1.5 μg kg-1 minute-1 [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 6.60; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.91-14.96], poor premedication quality (AOR=4.60; 95% CI, 1.73-12.23) and a time to stand > 70 minutes (AOR=2.59; 95% CI, 1.13-5.91). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our study shows that high dobutamine requirements, poor premedication quality and a prolonged time to stand are risk factors for unsatisfactory recovery quality in horses undergoing anaesthesia for  colic surgery. Addressing these factors may enable clinicians to improve the quality of recovery phase.	0
35290946	Reliability of steatocrit as an indicator of intestinal health in young birds - Relationships with morphology and growth rate of canary Serinus canaria nestlings.	Intestinal health and capacity to efficiently absorb nutrients from diet, including fat, has been recently suggested as a promising physiological health indicator in wild birds, due to its association with gut parasitism and feather coloration. However, little information is available about the sources of variation of non-absorbed fat in birds' faeces, measured by the acid steatocrit technique, and particularly in nestling birds. We assessed steatocrit in captive  nestling canaries Serinus canaria and evaluated if it was affected by breed and its relationship with growth (linear growth rate, LGR) and body mass. We also assessed the presence of coccidia infections. Steatocrit differed significantly between day 9 and 14 of the nestling period, being lower when nestlings were 14 days old. Age must be taken into account when assessing steatocrit in young birds; this variation may be due to a development of the digestive system with age or the amount of fat provided later in the nestling period being more adequate to the nestlings' needs. Steatocrit was higher in nestling canaries from yellow lipochromic than red lipochromic breeds. No coccidia infections were detected. Steatocrit did not affect LGR, but steatocrit measured at day 9 was positively related with body mass at day 14. The positive relationship between steatocrit and body mass in canary nestlings suggests that nestlings in breeding  facilities may be fed a larger amount of fat than that they can absorb. This physiological assessment of intestinal health may be a better general health indicator in wild adult birds exposed to a higher level and diversity of parasites.	0
35049835	Part I of Finnish Agility Dog Survey: Training and Management of Competition-Level Agility Dogs.	Knowledge regarding training, competition, and management routines of agility dogs is lacking. Through a retrospective online questionnaire, Finnish owners and handlers of 745 competition-level agility dogs provided information on training routines and management of these dogs during one year free of agility-related injuries. Competition routines were collected from the national competition results database. Most dogs trained agility 1-2 times a week, with a median active training time of 18 min a week. Dogs competed in a median of 2.1 runs per  month at a speed of 4.3 m/s. Common field surfaces were different types of artificial turfs and dirt surface. Warm-up and cool-down were established routines, and 62% of dogs received regular musculoskeletal care. Moreover, 77% of dogs underwent conditioning exercises, but their frequency was often low. Additionally, dogs were walked for a median of 1.5 h daily. Pearson's chi-squared and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to evaluate the association between a dog's competition level and training and competition variables. A dog's competition level was associated with competition (p < 0.001) and training frequency (p < 0.001); dogs at higher levels compete more but train less than dogs at lower levels. This study provides information on training, competition, and management  routines of competing agility dogs.	0
35013475	Training associated alterations in equine respiratory immunity using a multiomics comparative approach.	Neutrophilic airway inflammation is highly prevalent in racehorses in training, with the term mild to moderate equine asthma (MMEA) being applied to the majority of such cases. Our proposed study is largely derived from the strong association  between MMEA in racehorses and their entry into a race training program. The objectives of this study are to characterise the effect of training on the local  pulmonary immune system by defining the gene and protein expression of tracheal wash (TW) derived samples from Thoroughbred racehorses prior to and following commencement of race training. Multiomics analysis detected 2138 differentially expressed genes and 260 proteins during the training period. Gene and protein sets were enriched for biological processes related to acute phase response, oxidative stress, haemopoietic processes, as well as to immune response and inflammation. This study demonstrated TW samples to represent a rich source of airway cells, protein and RNA to study airway immunity in the horse and highlighted the benefits of a multiomics methodological approach to studying the  dynamics of equine airway immunity. Findings likely reflect the known associations between race-training and both airway inflammation and bleeding, offering further insight into the potential mechanisms which underpin training associated airway inflammation.	0
35023989	Effect of prostaglandin F2α administration on uterine polymorphonuclear neutrophil counts in Japanese heavy draft horses.	The objective of this study was to examine the effect of prostaglandin F2α (dinoprost) and oxytocin administration on uterine polymorphonuclear neutrophil counts in the Japanese heavy draft mare. To compare polymorphonuclear neutrophil  (PMN) counts in the endometrium, a total of 162 samples were collected from 54 estruses of 47 mares (before ovulation, day 0, and day 2) using a double-guarded  cytology brush. Dinoprost (PG; 5 mg) was administered intramuscularly (i.m.) only once, on day 0, whereas oxytocin (OT; 20 U i.m.) was administered three times at  12-hr intervals starting on day 0. The plasma progesterone concentrations from days 0 to 14 were not different between the non-treatment (CON), PG treatment, and OT treatment groups. The PMN counts increased in all the groups from before administration to day 0 (CON, 0.90 to 3.55; PG, 1.20 to 8.45; and OT, 0.70 to 1.70; P=0.0014, 0.0046, and 0.0073, respectively). There was a significant decrease in PMNs from day 0 to day 2 only in the PG group (P=0.0073). The pregnancy rate was not different among the CON (12/18), PG (14/18), and OT (10/18) groups. The results of this study indicate that dinoprost can reduce uterine polymorphonuclear neutrophil counts.	0
35218903	A Genome-Wide Scan for Signatures of Selection in Kurdish Horse Breed.	The genetic diversity and genomic regions being under putative natural selection  in Kurdish horse population were studied. The samples from 72 horses were genotyped by using GGP Equine 70K SNP arrays. The Ne Slope (NeS) analyses revealed that a sharp decline in Ne has probably occurred around four generations ago, and high frequency of ROH with 2-4 Mbp in length suggested that the inbreeding has probably occurred around 20 generations ago. The effective population size (Ne) was 104 horses up to three generations ago and the average inbreeding (FROH) was 0.047(± 0.045). Using de-correlated composite of multiple selection signals (DCMS) and runs of homozygosity (ROH) analyses the genomic regions being under putative selection were detected. By using DCMS, a total of 148 significant SNP (FDR < 0.05) were identified, 40% of which were located on ECA9, where the greatest peak was observed. This genomic region harbors several known QTL which are associated with withers height (body size). Also, significant genomic regions (FDR < 0.05), harboring QTL associated with insect bite hypersensitivity (IBH), hair density and coat texture, alternate gaits, guttural  pouch tympany and temperament were identified. By using outputs of ROH analyses,  two hotspot regions (i.e., 30% of individuals was considered as threshold), were  identified on ECA7 (50.11-54.36 Mbp) and ECA11 (26.10-29.07 Mbp) harboring QTL associated with withers height, alternate gait and IBH. In summary, the genomic regions being under putative natural selection which harbors known QTL associated with body size and IBH, among others, were introduced. Nevertheless, additional functional and comparative studies are necessary to corroborate their effect on the observed genetic and phenotypic diversity of the Kurdish horses.	0
34645387	Genome-wide scans for signatures of selection in Mangalarga Marchador horses using high-throughput SNP genotyping.	BACKGROUND: The detection of signatures of selection in genomic regions provides  insights into the evolutionary process, enabling discoveries regarding complex phenotypic traits. In this research, we focused on identifying genomic regions affected by different selection pressures, mainly highlighting the recent positive selection, as well as understanding the candidate genes and functional pathways associated with the signatures of selection in the Mangalarga Marchador  genome. Besides, we seek to direct the discussion about genes and traits of importance in this breed, especially traits related to the type and quality of gait, temperament, conformation, and locomotor system. RESULTS: Three different methods were used to search for signals of selection: Tajima's D (TD), the integrated haplotype score (iHS), and runs of homozygosity (ROH). The samples were composed of males (n = 62) and females (n = 130) that were initially chosen considering well-defined phenotypes for gait: picada (n = 86) and batida (n = 106). All horses were genotyped using a 670 k Axiom® Equine Genotyping Array​ (Axiom MNEC670). In total, 27, 104 (chosen), and 38 candidate genes were observed within the signatures of selection identified in TD, iHS, and ROH analyses, respectively. The genes are acting in essential biological processes. The enrichment analysis highlighted the following functions: anterior/posterior pattern for the set of genes (GLI3, HOXC9, HOXC6, HOXC5, HOXC4, HOXC13, HOXC11, and HOXC10); limb morphogenesis, skeletal system, proximal/distal pattern formation, JUN kinase activity (CCL19 and MAP3K6); and muscle stretch response (MAPK14). Other candidate genes were associated with energy metabolism, bronchodilator response, NADH regeneration, reproduction, keratinization, and the immunological system. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed evidence of signatures of selection in the MM  breed that encompass genes acting on athletic performance, limb development, and  energy to muscle activity, with the particular involvement of the HOX family genes. The genome of MM is marked by recent positive selection. However, Tajima's D and iHS results point also to the presence of balancing selection in specific regions of the genome.	0
34840454	Fertility restoration of racing mare with persistent corpus luteum.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Persistent corpus luteum (PCL) causes anestrus in mares. This study aimed to determine the effect of intrauterine prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) treatment on PCL of racing mares to restore fertility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve racing mares suspected with PCL were diagnosed using transrectal palpation and confirmed by serum progesterone (P4) concentration measurement. PGF2α was infused intrauterine, followed by serum collection at 24, 48, and 72 h after. Estrous symptoms were monitored, and mating was conducted on day 3 of estrus with an earlier injection of 8.4 μg gonadotropin-releasing hormone twice a day. Transrectal palpation was performed on days 21-30 to observe the corpus luteum. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed rectally on 40-45 days post-mating and confirmed using Doppler ultrasound scanning. RESULTS: Eleven of the 12 mares had PCL. There was a dramatic reduction in the P4 concentration following PGF2α treatment of mares with PCL. All mares exhibited estrus 2.6±0.55 days post-treatment with a P4 concentration of 0.12±0.12 ng/mL. Rectal palpation and P4 concentration on 21-30 days after estrous onset showed that all mares were ovulating. The evaluation of P4 concentration on days 40-45 post-mating showed that all mares were still in the luteal phase. However, the pregnancy rate was only 54.5% based on rectal palpation and Doppler ultrasound scanning. CONCLUSION: Treatment of PCL in racing mares with an intrauterine infusion of PGF2α restored the estrous cycle and induced ovulation and pregnancy.	0
34944240	Association between Cardiac Auscultation and Echocardiographic Findings in Warmblood Horses.	Heart murmurs are detected frequently when auscultating horses and certain murmurs can usually be linked to specific valvular regurgitations. Limited information exists about the accuracy of these broad rules in warmblood horses and the influence of grade of the regurgitation and dimensional changes on murmur intensity. This study aims to clarify the accuracy of cardiac auscultation in warmblood horses and the influence of the grade of regurgitation and dimensional  changes on the loudness of the murmur. In this retrospective study, 822 warmblood horses presented for cardiac examination in a large equine referral center in northern Germany underwent a thorough cardiac auscultation. In total, 653 of these revealed one or more heart murmurs. Most common auscultatory findings were  left-sided systolic murmurs (68%) or left-sided diastolic murmurs (15%). On 635 of these horses, an echocardiographic examination was performed, revealing regurgitations of the mitral valve as the most common valvular regurgitation (77%) followed by regurgitations of the aortic valve (23%). Thirty-one percent of horses that underwent echocardiographic examination displayed dimensional changes of one or more compartments of the heart, with the left atrium being most affected (21%), followed by the left ventricle (13%). The main goal of this study was to link certain auscultatory findings with results of the echocardiographic examinations, trying to determine whether auscultation and echocardiography agreed on the valve affected, as well as to find out if loudness of the murmur coincided with grade of regurgitation and presence of dimensional changes. Agreement between auscultation and cardiac ultrasound was substantial (Kappa 0.74) if one or more murmurs and regurgitations were present and almost perfect (Kappa 0.94) if only one murmur and one regurgitation were found. Auscultation was particularly well suited for detection of left-sided systolic and diastolic murmurs, with 87% of left-sided systolic murmurs being caused by a mitral valve regurgitation and 81% of left-sided diastolic murmurs originating from an aortic  valve regurgitation. We found a fair agreement between the grade of regurgitation and the respective murmur. Association was particularly good between mild regurgitations and low-grade murmurs, while differentiation between moderate to severe regurgitation based upon the loudness of the murmur was less reliable. Dimensional changes were usually linked to more severe regurgitations and higher-grade murmurs. However, a direct correlation between murmur intensity and  the presence or severity of dimensional changes, independent of the grade of valvular regurgitation, could not be established in this cohort of horses.	0
35304026	Improving pathways to eliminate underrepresentation in the pediatric surgery workforce: A call to action.	Despite progress, diversity and minority representation within the pediatric surgery workforce still does not match the expansive backgrounds of the patients  we treat. The problem stems from underrepresentation of minority populations at every step along the pediatric surgery training pathway. Strategies aimed at improving diversity and representation in medical school, general surgery residencies, and ultimately pediatric surgery fellowship are necessary to assemble a more diverse pool of pediatric surgeons. The aim of this paper is to review the current demographic make-up of medical and surgical specialties, highlight the value of diversity, and provide evidence-based strategies for increasing minority representation throughout the pediatric surgery pathway. Future patients will be better served with a more representative pediatric surgery workforce.	0
34991633	New approach for genomic characterisation of equine sarcoid-derived BPV-1/-2 using nanopore-based sequencing.	BACKGROUND: Bovine papillomavirus (BPV) types 1 and 2 play a central role in the  etiology of the most common neoplasm in horses, the equine sarcoid. The unknown mechanism behind the unique variety in clinical presentation on the one hand and  the host dependent clinical outcome of BPV-1 infection on the other hand indicate the involvement of additional factors. Earlier studies have reported the potential functional significance of intratypic sequence variants, along with the existence of sarcoid-sourced BPV variants. Therefore, intratypic sequence variation seems to be an important emerging viral factor. This study aimed to give a broad insight in sarcoid-sourced BPV variation and explore its potential association with disease presentation. METHODS: In order to do this, a nanopore sequencing approach was successfully optimized for screening a wide spectrum of clinical samples. Specimens of each tumour were initially screened for BPV-1/-2 by quantitative real-time PCR. A custom-designed primer set was used on BPV-positive samples to amplify the complete viral genome in two multiplex PCR reactions, resulting in a set of overlapping amplicons. For phylogenetic analysis, separate alignments were made of all available complete genome sequences for BPV-1/-2. The resulting alignments were used to infer Bayesian phylogenetic trees. RESULTS: We found substantial genetic variation among sarcoid-derived BPV-1, although this variation could not be linked to disease severity. Several of the BPV-1 genomes had multiple major deletions. Remarkably, the majority of them cluster within the region coding for late viral genes. Together with the extensiveness (up to 603 nucleotides) of the described deletions, this suggests an altered function of L1/L2 in disease pathogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: By generating a significant amount of complete-length BPV genomes, we succeeded to introduce next-generation sequencing into veterinary research focusing on the equine sarcoid, thus facilitating the first report of both nanopore-based sequencing of complete sarcoid-sourced BPV-1/-2 and the simultaneous nanopore sequencing of multiple complete genomes originating from a  single clinical sample.	0
35327102	Mitochondrial DNA Variation Contributes to the Aptitude for Dressage and Show Jumping Ability in the Holstein Horse Breed.	Maternal lineages are considered an important factor in breeding. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is maternally inherited and plays an important role in energy metabolism. It has already been associated with energy consumption and performances, e.g., stamina in humans and racehorses. For now, corresponding studies are lacking for sport performance of warmblood breeds. MtDNA sequences were available for 271 Holstein mares from 75 maternal lineages. As all mares within a lineage showed identical haplotypes regarding the non-synonymous variants, we expanded our data set by also including non-sequenced mares and assigning them to the lineage-specific haplotype. This sample consisting of 6334  to 16,447 mares was used to perform mitochondrial association analyses using breeding values (EBVs) estimated on behalf of the Fédération Équestre Nationale (FN) and on behalf of the Holstein Breeding Association (HOL). The association analyses revealed 20 mitochondrial SNPs (mtSNPs) significantly associated with FN-EBVs and partly overlapping 20 mtSNPs associated with HOL-EBVs. The results indicated that mtDNA contributes to performance differences between maternal lineages. Certain mitochondrial haplogroups were associated with special talents  for dressage or show jumping. The findings encourage to set up innovative genetic evaluation models that also consider information on maternal lineages.	0
34954292	Influences of the Seasons of the Year and Physiographic Regions on the Levels of  Calcium, Copper and Zinc in the Hoof Capsule of Foals Pre- and Postweaning Raised in Native Pasture.	This study evaluated the levels of calcium (Ca), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) in the hoof of Criollo foals, pre- and postweaning, correlating them with the concentrations of these inorganic chemical compounds in soil and pasture in the different seasons of the year. We used 41 preweaning foals and 28 postweaning foals. Seventeen forage samples were collected in four seasons, later 10 soil samples per property in five distinct physiographic regions (Santa Maria, Dilermando de Aguiar, Jaguarão, Arroio Grande and Pelotas). There was variability in Ca, Cu and Zn concentrations in the hoof foal between distinct physiographic regions (P < .05), and between seasons. There was no association of preweaning and postweaning Ca levels with forage in the different physiographic regions. The concentrations of Cu and Zn showed positive association (R = 0.69, 0.43; P < .05) with the native pastures in the different physiographic regions in preweaning. In postweaning, only Cu was positively associated (R = 0.74; P < .05). Different season and physiographic regions influence the levels of Ca, Cu and Zn in the hoof capsule and native pasture during the pre- and postweaning stages.	0
34666339	Non-KREEP origin for Chang'e-5 basalts in the Procellarum KREEP Terrane.	Mare volcanics on the Moon are the key record of thermo-chemical evolution throughout most of lunar history1-3. Young mare basalts-mainly distributed in a region rich in potassium, rare-earth elements and phosphorus (KREEP) in Oceanus Procellarum, called the Procellarum KREEP Terrane (PKT)4-were thought to be formed from KREEP-rich sources at depth5-7. However, this hypothesis has not been tested with young basalts from the PKT. Here we present a petrological and geochemical study of the basalt clasts from the PKT returned by the Chang'e-5 mission8. These two-billion-year-old basalts are the youngest lunar samples reported so far9. Bulk rock compositions have moderate titanium and high iron contents  with KREEP-like rare-earth-element and high thorium concentrations. However, strontium-neodymium isotopes indicate that these basalts were derived from a non-KREEP mantle source. To produce the high abundances of rare-earth elements and thorium, low-degree partial melting and extensive fractional crystallization are required. Our results indicate that the KREEP association may not be a prerequisite for young mare volcanism. Absolving the need to invoke heat-producing elements in their source implies a more sustained cooling history  of the lunar interior to generate the Moon's youngest melts.	0
35215208	Tumor Cell Plasticity in Equine Papillomavirus-Positive Versus-Negative Squamous  Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck.	Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) is a common malignant tumor  in humans and animals. In humans, papillomavirus (PV)-induced HNSCCs have a better prognosis than papillomavirus-unrelated HNSCCs. The ability of tumor cells to switch from epithelial to mesenchymal, endothelial, or therapy-resistant stem-cell-like phenotypes promotes disease progression and metastasis. In equine  HNSCC, PV-association and tumor cell phenotype switching are poorly understood. We screened 49 equine HNSCCs for equine PV (EcPV) type 2, 3 and 5 infection. Subsequently, PV-positive versus -negative lesions were analyzed for expression of selected epithelial (keratins, β-catenin), mesenchymal (vimentin), endothelial (COX-2), and stem-cell markers (CD271, CD44) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF; keratins/vimentin, CD44/CD271 double-staining) to address tumor cell plasticity in relation to PV infection. Only EcPV2 PCR scored positive for 11/49 equine HNSCCs. IHC and IF from 11 EcPV2-positive and 11 EcPV2-negative  tumors revealed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition events, with vimentin-positive cells ranging between <10 and >50%. CD44- and CD271-staining disclosed the intralesional presence of infiltrative tumor cell fronts and double-positive tumor cell subsets independently of the PV infection status. Our  findings are indicative of (partial) epithelial-mesenchymal transition events giving rise to hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal and stem-cell-like tumor cell phenotypes in equine HNSCCs and suggest CD44 and CD271 as potential malignancy markers that merit to be further explored in the horse.	0
34640904	Cardiac Diagnostic Feature and Demographic Identification (CDF-DI): An IoT Enabled Healthcare Framework Using Machine Learning.	The incidence of cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular burden (the number of deaths) are continuously rising worldwide. Heart disease leads to heart failure (HF) in affected patients. Therefore any additional aid to current medical support systems is crucial for the clinician to forecast the survival status for  these patients. The collaborative use of machine learning and IoT devices has become very important in today's intelligent healthcare systems. This paper presents a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) secured IoT enabled framework entitled Cardiac Diagnostic Feature and Demographic Identification (CDF-DI) systems with significant Models that recognize several Cardiac disease features related to HF. To achieve this goal, we used statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze the Cardiac secondary dataset. The Elevated Serum Creatinine (SC) levels  and Serum Sodium (SS) could cause renal problems and are well established in HF patients. The Mann Whitney U test found that SC and SS levels affected the survival status of patients (p < 0.05). Anemia, diabetes, and BP features had no  significant impact on the SS and SC level in the patient (p > 0.05). The Cox regression model also found a significant association of age group with the survival status using follow-up months. Furthermore, the present study also proposed important features of Cardiac disease that identified the patient's survival status, age group, and gender. The most prominent algorithm was the Random Forest (RF) suggesting five key features to determine the survival status  of the patient with an accuracy of 96%: Follow-up months, SC, Ejection Fraction (EF), Creatinine Phosphokinase (CPK), and platelets. Additionally, the RF selected five prominent features (smoking habits, CPK, platelets, follow-up month, and SC) in recognition of gender with an accuracy of 94%. Moreover, the five vital features such as CPK, SC, follow-up month, platelets, and EF were found to be significant predictors for the patient's age group with an accuracy of 96%. The Kaplan Meier plot revealed that mortality was high in the extremely old age group (χ2 (1) = 8.565). The recommended features have possible effects on clinical practice and would be supportive aid to the existing medical support system to identify the possibility of the survival status of the heart patient. The doctor should primarily concentrate on the follow-up month, SC, EF, CPK, and  platelet count for the patient's survival in the situation.	0
35203232	A Descriptive Study of the Clinical Presentation, Management, and Outcome of Horses with Acute Soft Tissue Trauma of the Tarsus and the Association with Synovial Involvement.	The tarsus is one of the most common areas of traumatic injury with associated synovial involvement (SI) in horses. The aim of this retrospective study was to describe the clinical presentation, diagnostic procedures, management (emphasizing the type, duration, and route of antimicrobial administration), and  outcome of cases with acute soft tissue trauma to the tarsal region. The presenting clinical features, the results of diagnostic modalities, and the initial response to therapy were assessed for their usefulness to predict SI. Medical records of 72 cases were included and SI was diagnosed in 34 cases (47.2%). Increased synovial effusion, lameness on admission (OR = 4.1; 95%CI 1.0-16.4), persistent lameness (OR = 5.7; 95%CI 1.8-17.9), increased blood SAA values (≥200 mg/L) from initial to second measurement (OR = 4.3; 95%CI 1.2-15.5), and wound location on the plantar/plantarolateral/plantaromedial compared to the  lateral aspect of the tarsus (OR = 7.0; 95%CI 1.6-30.9) were associated with SI.  Radiographs, ultrasonography, and the use of pressure testing when a wound was present proved to be useful in correctly diagnosing SI. The median duration of systemic antimicrobial administration was 8 (IQR: 5 to 9) days and most horses received local antimicrobial therapy. This study highlights several relevant clinical features and their association with SI and emphasizes the usefulness of  local antimicrobial therapy in these cases.	0
35209904	Prevalence and WGS-based characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus in the nasal mucosa and pastern of horses with equine pastern dermatitis.	BACKGROUND: Many contributing factors are involved in the development of equine pastern dermatitis (EPD). Among the most frequently suspected is Staphylococcus aureus, known for its pathogenic potential in skin and soft tissue infections. We therefore investigated the association between S. aureus carriage and EPD. RESULTS: One hundred five EPD-affected horses and 95 unaffected controls were examined for the presence of methicillin-resistant and -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA and MSSA) on the pastern skin and in the nostrils. S. aureus isolates were cultivated from swab samples on selective MSSA and MRSA chromogenic agar and identified using MALDI-TOF MS. Isolates were analysed by Illumina whole genome sequencing for genetic relatedness (cgMLST, spa typing), and for the presence of antimicrobial resistance and virulence determinants. A markedly higher proportion of samples from EPD-affected horses proved positive for S. aureus, both from the pastern (59.0 % vs. 6.3 % in unaffected horses; P<0.001), and from the nose (59.0 % vs. 8.4 %; P<0.001). Isolates belonged to 20  sequence types (ST) with lineages ST15-t084 (spa) (18 %), ST1-t127 (13 %), and ST1-t1508 (12 %) being predominant. Eight S. aureus were MRSA ST398-t011 and ST6239-t1456, and contained the staphylococcal cassette chromosome SCCmecIVa. Antimicrobial resistance genes were almost equally frequent in pastern and in nasal samples, whereas some virulence factors such as the beta-hemolysin, ESAT-6  secretion system, and some enterotoxins were more abundant in isolates from pastern samples, possibly enhancing their pathogenic potential. CONCLUSIONS: The markedly higher prevalence of S. aureus containing specific virulence factors in affected skin suggests their contribution in the development and course of EPD.	0
35240017	Genome-wide association study for frozen-thawed sperm motility in stallions across various horse breeds.	OBJECTIVE: The semen quality of stallions including sperm motility is an important target of selection as it has a high level of individual variability. However, effects of the molecular architecture of the genome on the mechanisms of sperm formation and their preservation after thawing have been poorly investigated. Here, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for the sperm motility of cryopreserved semen in stallions of various breeds. METHODS: Semen samples were collected from the stallions of 23 horse breeds. The  following semen characteristics were examined: progressive motility (PM), progressive motility after freezing (FPM), and the difference between PM and FPM. The respective DNA samples from these stallions were genotyped using Axiom™ Equine Genotyping Array. RESULTS: We performed a GWAS search for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and potential genes related to motility properties of frozen-thawed semen in the stallions of various breeds. As a result of the GWAS analysis, two SNP markers, rs1141327473 and rs1149048772, were identified that were associated with preservation of the frozen-thawed stallion sperm motility, the relevant putative  candidate genes being NME8, OR2AP1 and OR6C4. Potential implications of effects of these genes on sperm motility are herein discussed. CONCLUSION: The GWAS results enabled us to localize novel SNPs and candidate genes for sperm motility in stallions. Implications of the study for horse breeding and genetics are a better understanding of genomic regions and candidate genes underlying stallion sperm quality, and improvement in horse reproduction and breeding techniques. The identified markers and genes for sperm cryotolerance and the respective genomic regions are promising candidates for further studying  the biological processes in the formation and function of the stallion reproductive system.	0
34660140	Massive Lumbar Disc Herniation Causing Cauda Equina Syndrome That Presents As Bladder and Bowel Dysfunction in the Absence of Lower Extremity Weakness.	The purpose of this report is to examine the features of cauda equina syndrome (CES) presenting as bladder and bowel dysfunction in the absence of lower extremity weakness. Between July 2015 and July 2016, we experienced four cases of massive LDH causing CES that presented as bladder and bowel dysfunction in the absence of lower extremity weakness. Herein, we describe the clinical features of these four patients (two males and two females) who were followed for a minimum of two years postoperatively. The mean age at the time of surgery was 46.8 years  (range, 37-71 years). The disc herniation lesion was at the L4/5 level in one patient, and the L5/S1 level in three. The mean interval between the onset of CES and complete surgical decompression was 10.5 days (range, 1-18 days). Postoperative outcomes were better than poor in three of four cases, while one case had residual sphincter dysfunction. LDH causing CES is considered an indication for immediate surgical decompression; however, diagnosis of CES is likely to be delayed in atypical cases of CES that present as bladder and bowel dysfunction in the absence of lower extremity weakness. Diagnosis of CES tended to be delayed in cases without lower extremity weakness. Clinicians should recognize even sensory impairment alone of the dominant area supplied by S2-4 is  an important diagnostic sign of CES in the early stage.	0
34488849	Bactericidal activity of avian complement: a contribution to understand avian-host tropism of Lyme borreliae.	Complement has been considered as an important factor impacting the host-pathogen association of spirochetes belonging to the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, and may play a role in the spirochete's ecology. Birds are known to be important hosts for ticks and in the maintenance of borreliae. Recent field surveys and laboratory transmission studies indicated that certain avian species  act as reservoir hosts for different Borrelia species. Nevertheless, our current  understanding of the molecular mechanisms determining host tropism of Borrelia is still in its fledgling stage. Concerning the role of complement in avian-host tropism, only a few bird species and Borrelia species have been analysed so far.  Here, we performed in vitro serum bactericidal assays with serum samples collected from four bird species including the European robin Erithacus rubecula, the great tit Parus major, the Eurasian blackbird Turdus merula, and the racing pigeon Columba livia, as well as four Borrelia species (B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. valaisiana, and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto). From July to September 2019, juvenile wild birds were caught using mist nets in Portugal. Racing pigeons were  sampled in a loft in October 2019. Independent of the bird species analysed, all  Borrelia species displayed an intermediate serum-resistant or serum-resistant phenotype except for B. afzelii challenged with serum from blackbirds. This genospecies was efficiently killed by avian complement, suggesting that blackbirds served as dead-end hosts for B. afzelii. In summary, these findings suggest that complement contributes in the avian-spirochete-tick infection cycle  and in Borrelia-host tropism.	0
35336394	Incremental Ant-Miner Classifier for Online Big Data Analytics.	Internet of Things (IoT) environments produce large amounts of data that are challenging to analyze. The most challenging aspect is reducing the quantity of consumed resources and time required to retrain a machine learning model as new data records arrive. Therefore, for big data analytics in IoT environments where  datasets are highly dynamic, evolving over time, it is highly advised to adopt an online (also called incremental) machine learning model that can analyze incoming data instantaneously, rather than an offline model (also called static), that should be retrained on the entire dataset as new records arrive. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce the Incremental Ant-Miner (IAM), a machine learning algorithm for online prediction based on one of the most well-established machine learning algorithms, Ant-Miner. IAM classifier tackles the challenge of reducing the time and space overheads associated with the classic offline classifiers, when used for online prediction. IAM can be exploited in managing dynamic environments to ensure timely and space-efficient prediction, achieving high accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure scores. To  show its effectiveness, the proposed IAM was run on six different datasets from different domains, namely horse colic, credit cards, flags, ionosphere, and two breast cancer datasets. The performance of the proposed model was compared to ten state-of-the-art classifiers: naive Bayes, logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, support vector machine, K*, adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), bagging, Projective Adaptive Resonance Theory (PART), decision tree (C4.5), and random forest. The experimental results illustrate the superiority of IAM as it outperformed all the benchmarks in nearly all performance measures. Additionally, IAM only needs to be rerun on the new data increment rather than the entire big dataset on the arrival of new data records, which makes IAM better in time- and resource-saving. These results demonstrate the strong potential and efficiency of the IAM classifier for big data analytics in various areas.	0
35066423	Buffering capacity is determinant for restoring early α-synuclein aggregation.	For disordered proteins, including α-synuclein (Syn), the aggregation of which is implicated in Parkinson's disease, it is known that at mild acidic and at the pI  solution conditions the use of either strong or weak electrolytes minimized Syn aggregation. The mechanism is driven by electrostatic forces but remains, however, poorly understood. To address this issue, we used two biological buffers as weak electrolytes, at a low concentration (10 mM) and monitored the aggregation of Syn solutions from pH 7 to pH 2, by means of light scattering techniques. When the citrate buffer was used, in which there is buffering capacity in the pH range studied, the maximum of Syn aggregation was very close to the isoelectric point (pI = 4.7). When using tris-HCl, in which there is almost no buffering capacity in the pH range studied, it was for the first time observed a slow transition of the pI (of ca. 1 h) from 4.7 to 4-3, for a 33.5 μM  protein concentration, as an example. We also observed in the protein solutions (in tris-HCl) the very early formation of large Syn aggregates. When there is buffering capacity, such as pH 7, these early large Syn aggregates dissociate, followed by association/aggregation. When there is no buffering capacity, such as pH 3, the referred early large Syn aggregates only dissociate. Overall, early large Syn aggregates dissociation can cause entropy in the protein solutions and  Syn aggregation is only restored by the altered electrostatic forces due to the existing buffering capacity. Finally, by using an innovative strategy based in the ANS dye fluorescence intensity variation, we determined of the occurrence of  the liquid-liquid phase separation process at pH 7 Syn solutions.	0
35066184	Implantable defibrillator-detected heart failure status predicts atrial fibrillation occurrence.	BACKGROUND: In heart failure (HF) patients, atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a worse prognosis. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) diagnostics allow continuous monitoring of AF and are equipped with algorithms for HF monitoring. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the association between the values of the multisensor HF  HeartLogic index and the incidence of AF, and assessed the performance of the index in detecting follow-up periods of significantly increased AF risk. METHODS: The HeartLogic feature was activated in 568 ICD patients. Median follow-up was 25 months [25th-75th percentile (15-35)]. The HeartLogic algorithm  calculates a daily HF index and identifies periods of IN-alert state on the basis of a configurable threshold. The endpoints were daily AF burden ≥5 minutes, ≥6 hours, and ≥23 hours. RESULTS: The HeartLogic index crossed the threshold value 1200 times. AF burden ≥5 minutes/day was documented in 183 patients (32%), ≥6 hours/day in 118 patients (21%), and ≥23 hours/day in 89 patients (16%). The weekly time of IN-alert state  was independently associated with AF burden ≥5 minutes/day (hazard ratio [HR] 1.95; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22-3.13; P = .005), ≥6 hours/day (HR 2.66; 95% CI 1.60-4.44; P <.001), and ≥23 hours/day (HR 3.32; 95% CI 1.83-6.02; P <.001), after correction for baseline confounders. Comparison of the episode rates in the IN-alert state with those in the OUT-of-alert state yielded HR ranging from 1.57 to 3.11 for AF burden from ≥5 minutes to ≥23 hours. CONCLUSIONS: The HeartLogic alert state was independently associated with AF occurrence. The intervals of time defined by the algorithm as periods of increased risk of HF allow risk stratification of AF according to various thresholds of daily burden.	0
34607679	Bile Acids, Direct Bilirubin and Gamma-glutamyltransferase as Prognostic Indicators for Horses with Liver Disease in the Eastern United States: 82 Cases (1997-2019).	Serum biochemistry results and presence of fibrosis on liver biopsies are frequently used as prognostic indicators in horses with liver dysfunction. The objective of this retrospective multicenter study was to determine if the magnitude of abnormal liver specific biochemical tests such as bile acids (BA), direct bilirubin and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), or the presence of fibrosis reported on liver biopsies was associated with prognosis in horses with liver dysfunction. Eighty-two horses older than one year, examined at four referral hospitals in the eastern United States, with BA values greater than 30 µmol/L and having 6-months or more follow-up were included in the study. The association of  the maximal BA, GGT and direct bilirubin values of each horse with survival was determined by logistic regression analysis. The presence or absence of fibrosis (non-quantitated) on a liver biopsy was compared between survivors and non-survivors by chi square test. The degree of increase in BA concentration and  GGT activity was not related to outcome (OR 0.9999, 95% CI 0.9923 - 1.007, P = 0.97, and OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.9997 - 1.001, P = 0.31 respectively). Direct bilirubin concentration was positively associated with non-survival (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.34-3.19, P = 0.0023). The presence of fibrosis was not associated with outcome (P = 0.37). These findings suggest that the magnitude of GGT and BA values or the mere presence of fibrosis on liver histopathology should not be used as prognostic indicators. In this study, direct bilirubin values were a better predictor of outcome.	0
34607691	The Combination of hCG and GnRH Analog to Hasten Ovulation in Mares Does not Change Luteal Function and Pregnancy Outcome in Embryo Recipient Mares.	Equine practitioners often prescribe the combined use of hCG and GnRH to hasten ovulation due to presumed synergistic effects. Therefore, this study aimed to test whether the combination of hCG and deslorelin acetate to hasten ovulation in mares would show any effect in inducing ovulation more efficiently than when either drug is used by itself, and to verify whether this association would affect progesterone concentrations; corpus luteum (CL) diameter and blood flow; and pregnancy outcome in recipient mares after embryo transfer (ET). Seventeen mares had the ovulation hastened (≥35 mm follicle) as follow: Control, 1 mL of 0.9% NaCl solution; GnRH, 1 mg of deslorelin acetate; hCG, 1,500 IU of hCG; hCG+GnRH, 1mg of deslorelin acetate and 1,500 IU of hCG. CL diameter and blood flow, and serum progesterone concentrations were assessed between the day of ovulation induction and sixteen days after ovulation. In addition, data of 194 ET were retrospectively analyzed. Pregnancy rates at five days after ET and pregnancy loss up to 60 days of recipient mares with natural ovulation (Control,  n=37), or with ovulation hastened with hCG (n=25), or deslorelin acetate (n=46),  or the combination of these hormones (n=86), as described above, were assessed. The control group had a higher progesterone concentration on the day of ovulation than the GnRH group (P < .05). However, there were no differences in CL diameter  and blood flow at any time point, as well as in progesterone concentration over time (P > .05). Pregnancy rates and pregnancy loss didn't differ between recipient mares treated or not with hormones. In conclusion, the combination of hCG and deslorelin acetate to hasten ovulation was not able to change luteal development, progesterone concentration, or pregnancy outcome in recipient mares  after ET.	0
34883360	The Dynamic Equine Embryo from Postfixation (Day 17) to the End of the Embryo Stage (Day 40).	After the cessation of equine embryo mobility (fixation) on mean Day 16, the embryonic vesicle is rotated or oriented so that the pole with the embryo proper  is opposite to the mesometrial attachment. Orientation involves massage of the vesicle by contractions of the turgid uterine horn and greater thickening of the  vesicle at the pole with the embryo proper. Thickening of the dorsal endometrium  (encroachment) especially on each side of the mesometrial attachment accounts for a guitar-pick shape of the vesicle when viewed in cross section of the uterine horn. On Days 21-40, the allantoic sac expands, and the relative size of the yolk sac diminishes highlighted by carrying of the embryo proper to the dorsal aspect  of the embryonic vesicle. There, the blood vessels from the embryonic vesicle meet at the mesometrial attachment to become the beginning of the umbilical cord. At the end of the embryo stage and beginning of the fetal stage (Day 40), the umbilical cord lengthens in association with the descent of the fetus to the bottom of the allantoic sac. After unilateral fixation of twins, a natural embryo reduction process frequently (∼85%) eliminates one of the embryos. The twins are  massaged by the uterine contractions, and a critical proportion of the thicker wall of the doomed embryonic vesicle is forced into the thinner wall of the survivor. Natural embryo reduction does not occur for bilateral twins and reduction requires intervention from the theriogenologist.	0
35203157	Associations between Exercise-Induced Pulmonary Hemorrhage (EIPH) and Fitness Parameters Measured by Incremental Treadmill Test in Standardbred Racehorses.	Exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH) is a condition affecting up to 95% of racehorses, diagnosed by detecting blood in the trachea after exercise and/or  the presence of hemosiderophages in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALf). Although EIPH is commonly associated with poor performance, scientific evidence is scarce. The athletic capacity of racehorses can be quantified through some parameters obtained during an incremental treadmill test; in particular, the speed at a heart rate of 200 bpm (V200), and the speed (VLa4) and the heart rate  (HRLa4) at which the blood lactate concentration reaches 4 mmol/L are considered  good fitness indicators. The present retrospective study aims to evaluate whether EIPH could influence fitness parameters in poorly performing Standardbreds. For this purpose, data from 81 patients regarding their V200, VLa4, HRLa4, peak lactate, maximum speed, minimum pH, and maximum hematocrit were reviewed; EIPH scores were assigned based on tracheobronchoscopy and BALf cytology. The association between the fitness parameters and EIPH was evaluated through Spearman's correlation analysis. No relationship between EIPH and V200, VLa4, and HRLa4 was observed. Interestingly, EIPH-positive horses showed higher hematocrit  values (p = 0.0072, r = 0.47), suggesting the possible influence of the hemoconcentration on the increase of pulmonary capillary pressure as a part of the pathogenesis of EIPH.	0
34824385	Large-scale DNA demethylation occurs in proliferating ovarian granulosa cells during mouse follicular development.	During ovarian follicular development, granulosa cells proliferate and progressively differentiate to support oocyte maturation and ovulation. To determine the underlying links between proliferation and differentiation in granulosa cells, we determined changes in 1) the expression of genes regulating DNA methylation and 2) DNA methylation patterns, histone acetylation levels and genomic DNA structure. In response to equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG), granulosa cell proliferation increased, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) significantly decreased and Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) significantly increased in S-phase granulosa cells. Comprehensive MeDIP-seq analyses documented that eCG treatment decreased methylation of promoter regions in approximately 40% of the genes in granulosa cells. The expression of specific demethylated genes was significantly increased in association with specific histone modifications and changes in DNA structure. These epigenetic processes were suppressed by a cell cycle inhibitor. Based on these results, we propose that the timing of sequential epigenetic events is essential for progressive, stepwise changes in granulosa cell differentiation.	0
34853198	Comparison of seven nucleic acid amplification tests for detection of Taylorella  equigenitalis.	Taylorella equigenitalis causes contagious equine metritis. Here we compared seven nucleic acid amplification tests for T. equigenitalis to select a rapid and reliable diagnostic method. The 95% detection limits of each assay varied greatly: real-time PCR had the lowest detection limit (0.77 fg/reaction); those of some of the conventional PCRs (cPCRs) were >100 fg/reaction. In experimentally infected samples, real-time PCR and semi-nested PCR showed the highest positive numbers (33 out of 42 samples), but two of the cPCRs detected only 2 and 7 positive results. Our results indicate that the use of sensitive molecular assays is important for the efficient detection of T. equigenitalis in clinical samples.	0
34722200	Electrochemotherapy for the treatment of cutaneous solid tumors in equids: A retrospective study.	Background: Electrochemotherapy (ECT) promotes the increased uptake of antitumor  agents through the administration of permeabilizing electric pulses, thus enhancing chemotherapy effectiveness. Aim: Our study aimed to describe the tolerability and efficacy of ECT alone or in association with surgery to manage solid neoplasms in equids. Methods: Medical records of equids with a diagnosis of malignant tumors treated with ECT alone or in combination with surgery were retrospectively evaluated. Each equid received local treatment within the tumors or the tumors' bed with cisplatin at the dose of 0.5 mg/cm2. Trains of permeabilizing biphasic electric pulses were then applied under spinal or general anesthesia. Results: Sixteen equids were enrolled in this study. There were nine melanoma cases, four fibrosarcoma, and three squamous cell carcinoma. Of those 16 equids,  7 received ECT for treatment of intraoperative local disease, while in 9 cases, ECT was the only treatment modality. The seven equids treated with the combination of ECT and surgery still have no evidence of disease at different times ranging from 9 to 60 months. The remaining nine had the following responses: two complete remissions, five partial responses, one stable disease, and one progressive disease. The treatment was well-tolerated, and local side effects were minimal. No systemic effects were documented. Conclusion: This retrospective study suggests that ECT may be beneficial for equids with solid neoplasms and could be a useful addition to the current therapeutic options considering its low cost, limited toxicity, and ease of administration.	0
34894412	Phenylbutazone pharmacokinetics in southern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum simum) after oral administration.	Southern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum simum) frequently develop painful  conditions, such as traumatic injuries or osteoarthritis, necessitating the administration of pain-relieving medications. One of the preferred treatments is  the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug phenylbutazone because of the availability of oral formulations and the familiarity of its use in horses. For the main study, a single oral dose of phenylbutazone at 2 mg/kg was administered  to healthy adult rhinoceros (n = 33) housed at six North American zoological institutions. Each rhinoceros had up to four blood samples collected under voluntary behavioural restraint at up to four predetermined time points (0, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24, 30 and 48 h). Drug analysis was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The population pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated with nonlinear mixed-effects modelling, and analysis showed a peak concentration (CMAX ) of 3.8 µg/ml at 1.8 h and an elimination half-life of  9 h. The concentrations achieved were similar to what has been reported for horses and were within the half maximal effective concentration for horses for at least 10 h. A multi-dose trial in five rhinoceros receiving 2 mg/kg orally once daily for five days found mild accumulation at a predicted factor of 1.2. This study represents the first pharmacokinetic data of phenylbutazone in any rhinoceros species.	0
35341910	Comparison of Heel Movement Between two Different Glue-on Type Shoes and Nailed Shoes in Thoroughbreds.	Gluing an aluminum shoe onto equine hooves has been known to restrict heel movement and might cause interference with shock absorption and blood flow to the hoof. To investigate the effects of new glue-on type shoes on heel movement, 2 experiments that compared forelimb heel movement between conventional nailed shoes and flexible polyurethane glue-on shoes or Hanton-type shoes, which had 2 side clips for adhesive, were conducted on separate days. A displacement sensor was fixed on the heel to measure the forelimb's mediolateral heel movement. Exercise consisted of walking at 1.7 m/s, trotting at 4 m/s, cantering at 8 and 12 m/s for 30 seconds on a treadmill without a slope. The average heel expansion, contraction, and total heel movement (sum of the absolute expansion and contraction values) of 10 consecutive strides between the nailed shoes and glue-on shoes were compared using the paired t-tests. No significant differences  in heel movement were observed between polyurethane glued shoes and nailed shoes  regardless of gait. During trotting, Hanton shoes promoted significantly smaller  heel expansion (14% decrease, P < 0.01) and larger heel contraction (11% increase, P = 0.03) compared to conventional nailed shoes, although no difference in total heel movement was observed. Furthermore, neither heel expansion nor contraction nor total movement in other gaits showed significant differences between Hanton shoes and conventional nailed shoes. The aforementioned results suggested that the new glue-on type shoes promoted similar heel movement compared to conventional nailed shoes.	0
34939209	First reported case of fragile foal syndrome type 1 in the Thoroughbred caused by PLOD1 c.2032G>A.	BACKGROUND: Warmblood Fragile Foal Syndrome Type 1 (WFFS) is an autosomal recessive disorder reported previously only in warmbloods and thought to be caused by a variant in the gene procollagen-lysine,2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 1 (PLOD1, c.2032G>A, p.Gly678Arg). Given the presentation of this Thoroughbred case, we hypothesised that a similar genetic mechanism caused this phenotype. OBJECTIVES: To describe the pathological and genetic findings on a foal presenting to a veterinary practice in the UK with skin lesions similar to other  Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes, including those documented for warmbloods with WFFS. STUDY DESIGN: A single case report describing a genetic investigation. METHODS: A Thoroughbred foal presenting as dystocia was euthanised for multiple skin lesions and developmental abnormalities. DNA extracted from the foal was tested for the PLOD1 variant (c.2032G>A, p.Gly678Arg) using the commercially available assay. To confirm causality and further interrogate potential novel causes of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, 1799 functional candidate genes, including PLOD1, were analysed using whole genome sequencing data generated from DNA extracted from the foal's muscle. These data were compared to 34 control samples  from at least 11 other breeds. Variants were prioritised for further evaluation based on predicted impact on protein function. RESULTS: Post-mortem evaluation concluded that this foal suffered from a condition of collagen dysplasia. The foal was homozygous for the c.2032G>A PLOD1  variant. Only two other missense variants identified from whole genome sequencing data were also computationally predicted to be deleterious to protein function, (NPHP3 c.1253T>C, p.Leu418Pro, EPDR1 c.154G>C, p.Glu52Gln). Neither of these genes have been linked to similar phenotypes, or Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome in humans or other species and thus further investigation of these variants as the cause of EDS was not warranted. MAIN LIMITATIONS: This study is a single case report in the Thoroughbred with no  additional cases from this breed yet identified to replicate this finding. CONCLUSIONS: Given the clinical presentation similar to WFFS, homozygosity for the PLOD1 variant, and absence of another more plausible causal variant from the  WGS experiment, we conclude that PLOD1 c.2032G>A is the likely cause of this foal's condition. This is the first documented evidence of fragile foal syndrome  caused by the PLOD1 variant in a breed outside of warmbloods, the Thoroughbred. We therefore recommend a change in the name of this disorder to fragile foal syndrome type 1 (FFS) and utilisation of genetic testing in Thoroughbreds to avoid producing affected foals.	0
35157032	Genome-wide association study and functional follow-up identifies 14q12 as a candidate risk locus for cervical cancer.	Cervical cancer is amongst the leading causes of cancer-related death in females  worldwide. Infection by Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is an established risk factor  for cancer development. However, genetic factors contributing to disease risk remain largely unknown. We report on a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 375 German cervical cancer patients and 866 healthy controls, followed by a replication study comprising 658 patients with invasive cervical cancer, 1361 with cervical dysplasia and 841 healthy controls. Functional validation was performed for the top GWAS variant on chromosome 14q12 (rs225902, close to PRKD1). After bioinformatic annotation and in silico predictions, we performed transcript analysis in a cervical tissue series of 317 samples, and demonstrate rs225902 as an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for FOXG1 and two tightly co-regulated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) at this genomic region, CTD-2251F13 (lnc-PRKD1-1) and CTD-2503I6 (lnc-FOXG1-6). We also show allele-specific effects of the 14q12 variants via luciferase assays. We propose a combined effect of genotype, HPV status and gene expression at this locus on cervical cancer progression. Taken together, this work uncovers a potential candidate locus with regulatory functions and contributes to the understanding of genetic susceptibility to cervical cancer.	0
35052325	Clinical Study on the Efficacy and Safety of Arginine Administered Orally in Association with Other Active Ingredients for the Prevention and Treatment of Sarcopenia in Patients with COVID-19-Related Pneumonia, Hospitalized in a Sub-Intensive Care Unit.	In order to evaluate the efficacy of oral supplementation with 3 g of arginine per day associated with creatine, L-carnitine, aspartic acid, magnesium, selenium and vitamins C and E (Argivit© Aesculapius Farmaceutici) in the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia in patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia, we conducted a parallel randomized study comparing it with standard therapy alone. Forty patients on standard therapy plus supplementation were compared with a control group of 40 patients, all hospitalized at the sub-intensive care unit of the Del  Mare Hospital in Naples, with a clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 pneumonia. Muscle strength was assessed with the handgrip test and muscle ultrasound. Arginine-supplemented patients had an average grip strength of 23.5 at the end of hospitalization compared with 22.5 in the untreated group with less reduction, showing statistical significance (p < 0.001). In the same way, the thickness of the vastus lateralis quadriceps femoris muscle measured at the end of hospitalization showed less reduction on ultrasound, with a higher average value in the group receiving treatment than in the group of patients without supplementation (p < 0.001). Upon discharge there was a 58.40% reduction in ventilation days in patients with arginine supplementation compared with the control group.	0
35134412	A 600 years sediment record of heavy metal pollution history in the Danube Delta.	Heavy metal pollution in the Danube Delta (in sediments, water and living organisms) has recently received increasing attention due to its impact on ecosystems health and water quality. However, long term records of heavy metal contamination are not available to date. In this study radiometric dating and geochemical analyses for major elements (Al, Fe, Ca and S) and metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Ni, Cr and Cd) were performed on the top 4 m of a 9-m sediment core retrieved from the alluvial plain of Sulina distributary channel aiming to reconstruct the  heavy metal geological background and contamination history and discuss the possible origins (natural vs. anthropogenic) of metals and the main factors driving their temporal variation. Chronological analysis revealed that the top 4  m of the core span the last ~600 years. Three distinct sediment units (U1: 400-200, U2: 200-140, U3: 140-15) were identified based on the downcore element concentration variation. The lower unit (400-200 cm, ~1450-1700 CE) shows an upward increase of Cu, Zn, Pb, Ni, Cr and Cd metal contents, which are strongly correlated with Al. Enrichment factor (EF) analysis indicates that metals detected in this unit are derived primarily from natural sources. In contrast, metals show elevated EF values within the middle (200-140 cm, ~1700-1770 CE) and  upper unit (140-15 cm, ~1770 CE to present). The highest degrees of enrichment of Cu, Zn and Cd occur in the peat layer of the middle unit (U2) which displays higher organic carbon and sulfur contents, indicating that diagenetic enrichment  of detected metals occurs under reducing condition. Overall, sediment contamination is moderate while the level increases with time. This study provides new insights into the metal contamination history of deltaic environments and yields baseline values for heavy metal contents in pristine sediments deposited prior to the onset of anthropogenic impact.	0

34521286	Flow cytometric analysis of equine bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells in horses with and without severe equine asthma.	Severe equine asthma (SEA) is a common, debilitating lower airway inflammatory disorder of older horses. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) survey inhaled particulates  from barn sources causing them to switch from an anti-inflammatory to a proinflammatory phenotype, resulting in neutrophil recruitment to the lung. This  proinflammatory switch may contribute to the development and prolongation of SEA. Validated antibodies to identify the cells involved in the pathogenesis of SEA are lacking. In this study, monoclonal antibodies against CD90, CD163, and CD206  were tested for reactivity with equine leukocytes by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry. A multi-color flow cytometric assay was developed to identify leukocytes in equine bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Four control and 4 SEA-susceptible horses had BALF collected before and after a 48-hour moldy hay challenge. Antibodies against CD90 uniquely labeled equine neutrophils, and antibodies against CD163 and CD206 identified equine macrophages. Postchallenge AM surface expression of CD163 increased in both groups of horses, but the increase was statistically significant in only the SEA-susceptible group (P = .02). The surface expression of CD206 on AMs increased significantly in the SEA-susceptible group (P = .03) but was unchanged in the control group (P = .5).  Increased expression of CD163 and CD206 during exacerbation of SEA suggested an association between AM phenotype and lung inflammation. However, functions of AMs in the pathogenesis of SEA remain to be elucidated.	0
34530514	Evaluation of recent changes in genetic variability in Thoroughbred horses based  on microsatellite markers parentage panel in Korea.	OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to investigate the recent changes such as allele frequencies and total probability of exclusion (PE) in Thoroughbred horses in Korea using short tandem repeat (STR) parentage panels between 2006 and 2016. METHODS: The genotype was provided for 5,988 horse samples with 15 microsatellite markers (AHT4, AHT5, ASB2, ASB17, ASB23, CA425, HMS1, HMS2, HMS3, HMS6, HMS7, HTG4, HTG10, LEX3 and VHL20). RESULTS: In our study, the observed number of alleles per locus ranged from 3 (HMS1) to 9 (ASB17) in 2006 and 4 (HMS1) to 9 (ASB2) in 2016, with a mean value of 6.28 and 6.40, respectively. Of the 15 markers, HMS2, HTG4, and CA425 loci had relatively low polymorphism information content (<0.5000) in the Thoroughbred population. Mean levels of genetic variation in 2006 and 2016 were observed heterozygosity (HO) = 0.708, and expected heterozygosity (HE) = 0.685, as well as and HO = 0.699 and HE = 0.682, respectively. The PE was calculated for each group based on the allele frequencies of 14 or 15 STRs. The 2006 survey analyzed that PE was 0.9998, but it increased to 0.9999 in 2016 after the HMS2 marker was added in 2011. The current STR panel is still a powerful tool for parentage verification that contributes to the maintenance of integrity in the Thoroughbred population. CONCLUSION: The current STR panel is still a powerful tool for parentage verification that contributes to the maintenance of integrity in the Thoroughbred horses. However, continuous monitoring genetic variability is necessary.	0
35451153	A genetic investigation of equine recurrent uveitis in the Icelandic horse breed.	Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) is an autoimmune disease defined by inflammation of the uveal tract of the eye. The cause of ERU is thought to be complex, involving both genetic and environmental factors. The purpose of this study was to investigate potential genetic risk factors for ERU in the Icelandic horse. Fifty-six Icelandic horses (11 affected with ERU and 45 controls) living in Denmark and the USA, eight years or older, were included in the study. A case-control GWAS was performed using the GGP Equine 80K array on the Illumina Infinium HD Beadchip using 40 horses. A mixed linear model analysis identified a  single SNP on ECA 11 (BIEC2_141650; NC_009154.3:g.3817009A>G) that reached genome-wide significance (p = 1.79 × 10-7 ). This variant was within an intron of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2), a gene previously implicated in  ERU. Sanger sequencing identified a single coding variant in this gene; however it was a synonymous mutation (NC_009154.3:g.3858193C>T) and was not perfectly concordant with ERU phenotype (p = 0.68). Further investigation of TIMP2 is warranted. Additional horses and markers are needed to identify other potential loci worthy of further investigation as contributors to ERU risk in Icelandic horses.	0
34884201	Clinical Impact of Hormone Replacement Therapy on Atrial Fibrillation in Postmenopausal Women: A Nationwide Cohort Study.	Individuals with atrial fibrillation (AF), especially women, have an increased risk of stroke and death. Although hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is widely used in postmenopausal women, the association between HRT use and AF risk is unclear. We aimed to investigate the association between various types of HRT and AF. This was a population-based retrospective cohort study from The Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (2004-2015). Participants were aged 45-60 years and were free from cardiovascular disease and  AF at baseline. Overall, 13,452 (64.03%) women had never received HRT, 5671 (26.99%) had received HRT, and 1885 (8.98%) were currently receiving HRT. In multivariable analysis, the relative hazards for AF were significantly higher among current users (p < 0.001) and lower among past users (p = 0.069). Current users-except those using estradiol-only HRT-had significantly elevated AF risk. Among past users, only estradiol plus progestin HRT users had a reduced AF risk after adjusting for covariates (p = 0.027). Ongoing HRT posed an increased risk of AF. The degree of risk varied based on the specific type of estrogen and progestins co-administration. These findings indicate that, with respect to AF risk, oral estradiol-containing HRT is superior to HRT containing oral conjugated equine estrogen or tibolone.	0
34939714	Radiofrequency ablation and related ultrasound-guided ablation technologies for treatment of benign and malignant thyroid disease: An international multidisciplinary consensus statement of the American Head and Neck Society Endocrine Surgery Section with the Asia Pacific Society of Thyroid Surgery, Associazione Medici Endocrinologi, British Association of Endocrine and Thyroid Surgeons, European Thyroid Association, Italian Society of Endocrine Surgery Units, Korean Society of Thyroid Radiology, Latin American Thyroid Society, and Thyroid Nodules Therapies Association.	BACKGROUND: The use of ultrasound-guided ablation procedures to treat both benign and malignant thyroid conditions is gaining increasing interest. This document has been developed as an international interdisciplinary evidence-based statement with a primary focus on radiofrequency ablation and is intended to serve as a manual for best practice application of ablation technologies. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted to guide statement development and generation of best practice recommendations. Modified Delphi method was applied to assess whether statements met consensus among the entire author panel. RESULTS: A review of the current state of ultrasound-guided ablation procedures for the treatment of benign and malignant thyroid conditions is presented. Eighteen best practice recommendations in topic areas of preprocedural evaluation, technique, postprocedural management, efficacy, potential complications, and implementation are provided. CONCLUSIONS: As ultrasound-guided ablation procedures are increasingly utilized in benign and malignant thyroid disease, evidence-based and thoughtful application of best practices is warranted.	0
34543774	Vulvar squamous cell carcinoma associated with Equus caballus papillomavirus type 2 infection in a Japanese mare.	Equus caballus papillomavirus type 2 (EcPV2) infection has been associated with genital squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) development in horses. However, very few reports on EcPV2-associated disease in Asia exist. Our study characterizes pathological and virological features of an EcPV2-associated vulvar SCC from a Japanese mare. Conventional PCR, in situ hybridization, reverse-transcriptase PCR and immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence and distribution of EcPV2 within  the lesion and suggested that p53 degradation may not be the mechanism by which this virus induces neoplastic transformation. The complete viral sequence in this Japanese case shows near perfect sequence homology with European reference strains of EcPV2, which may be useful when considering the target for future EcPV2 vaccine development. This report also serves to highlight the importance of EcPV2 in female (vulvar) neoplasia, which is less commonly recognized than EcPV2-induced male (penile or preputial) neoplasia. Finally, the SCC described in this mare was an unusual acantholytic variant that has not been reported previously in horses. It is the first report of EcPV2 identified from genital SCC in Asia and underscores the likely worldwide distribution of this virus and its consistent association with equine genital neoplasia.	0
35265400	A comparative study of life skills, lifestyle habits and academic performance in  health promoting and non-health promoting schools in the Autonomous Community of  Aragon, Spain.	Background: There is insufficient evidence about the impact of health promoting schools on the student's health and academic performance. The aim of this study was to compare the life skills, lifestyle habits and academic performance of 7th  and 8th grade students registered in health promoting and non-health promoting schools in the Autonomous Community of Aragon. Methods: An observational, descriptive, comparative study of the life skills, lifestyle habits and academic performance of 7th and 8th grade students registered in 43 randomly selected health promoting and non-health promoting schools was carried out. We used an adapted tool, which was validated through the expert panel technique, to evaluate the students' life skills (self-efficacy, social skills and affect balance), lifestyle habits (diet, sleep, physical exercise, use of screen and substance abuse) and academic performance. Results: The socioeconomic level of the mothers and fathers of the students who attended non-health promoting schools was significantly higher than that of the parents of the adolescents who attended health promoting schools (p < 0.001). The students who attended non-health promoting schools had better self-efficacy, led  a healthier life generally and achieved better academic results (p = 0.03). Conclusions: As opposed to previous studies, which found a positive association between health promoting schools and life skills, lifestyle habits and academic performance, our findings suggest that the impact of these health programs on the students' health and academic performance is limited. We recommend that the degree of implementation of health promotion programs in health promoting schools is systematically evaluated, and the health promoting school accreditation process and requirements reviewed, in order to ensure that the health of school children and adolescents is safeguarded and promoted in the short, medium and long term.	0
35417768	Effect of transvaginal aspiration of oocytes on blood and peritoneal fluid parameters in mares.	Transvaginal aspiration of oocytes (TVA) is a commonly used clinical procedure to obtain oocytes for in-vitro production of embryos in horses (IVP). The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of the TVA procedure on blood and peritoneal parameters, and to investigate the association of these findings with  variables such as use of antibiotics, number of ovarian punctures, and length of  the procedure. Physical examination was performed and blood and peritoneal fluid  were obtained from 14 mares before they underwent TVA and the same parameters were assessed 24 hours after the procedure. On examination, 13/14 mares remained  clinically healthy after the procedure. One mare developed low-grade fever, transient anorexia and mild colic that resolved within 12 hours post-TVA. The use of antibiotics, length of procedure and number of ovarian punctures did not have  an effect on the measured parameters. All the mares presented significant changes in the leukogram, but these mostly remained within normal reference range values. The peritoneal parameters were also consistently affected after TVA. A significant post-TVA increase in lactate, total protein, and peritoneal neutrophil count was observed in peritoneal fluid. Peritoneal lactate level was elevated above baseline physiological levels in more than 50% of the mares. Results from this study indicate that there is an expected degree of inflammation after TVA procedures and peritoneal fluid parameters could be successfully used to monitor inflammation in the early stages.	0
34956854	Molecular Identification of Equine Herpesvirus 1, 2, and 5 in Equids with Signs of Respiratory Disease in Central Ethiopia.	BACKGROUND: Equine herpesvirus (EHV) infections have major economic, health, and  welfare impacts on equids. This study was performed in three selected zones of central Ethiopia with the objectives of detecting EHV-1, -2, and -5 in horses and donkeys with suggestive signs of respiratory tract disease and to assess epidemiological risk factors associated with infections. METHODS: A total of 58 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from donkeys and horses showing clinical signs of respiratory disease. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect EHV-1, -2, and -5. Evaluation of the associated risk factors was conducted using a multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: Among the 58 equids tested, 36 (62%), 31 (53%), and 15 (25%) equids were positive for EHV-1, -2, and -5, respectively. Concurrent infections with EHV-1 and EHV-2 (31%), EHV-1 and EHV-5 (17%), EHV-2 and EHV-5 (15.5%), and EHV-1, -2, and -5 (13%) were recorded. EHV-1 was detected significantly in higher proportion in donkeys (76%; 95% CI: 1.066-2.251; P = 0.047) compared with horses (51.5%). In contrast, horses had fourteen times more likely to be positive for EHV-2 (OR: 13.66; 95% CI: 3.119-59.816; P = 0.001) compared to donkeys. Detection of EHV-1,  -2, and -5 was no significant association with age, sex, and body condition score. CONCLUSION: The present study revealed the molecular evidence of EHV-1, -2, and -5 infection in donkeys and horses with signs of respiratory disease. It also documented that donkeys and horses have varying levels of susceptibility to EHVs. This species-specific in susceptibility difference to EHVs infections should be further elucidated.	0
34792655	FrpA is the outer membrane piscibactin transporter in Vibrio anguillarum: structural elements in synthetic piscibactin analogues required for transport.	Piscibactin (Pcb) is a labile siderophore widespread among Vibrionaceae. Its production is a major virulence factor of some fish pathogens such as Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida and Vibrio anguillarum. Although FrpA was previously suggested as the putative outer membrane transporter (OMT) for ferri-piscibactin, its role in piscibactin uptake was never demonstrated. In this work, we generated mutants of V. anguillarum defective in FrpA and analyzed their ability to use piscibactin as iron source. The results showed that inactivation of frpA completely disables piscibactin utilization, and the original phenotype could be restored by gene complementation, confirming that FrpA is the OMT that mediates ferri-Pcb uptake. Additionally, the ability of several Pcb thiazole analogues, with different configurations at positions 9, 10, and 13, to be internalized through FrpA, was evaluated measuring their ability to promote growth under iron deficiency of several indicator strains. The results showed that while those analogues with a thiazole ring maintain almost the same activity as Pcb, the maintenance of the hydroxyl group present in natural piscibactin configuration at position C-13 is crucial for Fe3+ chelation and, in consequence, for the recognition of the ferri-siderophore by the cognate OMT. All these findings allowed us to propose a Pcb analogue as a good candidate to vectorize antimicrobial compounds, through the Trojan horse strategy, to develop novel compounds against bacterial fish diseases.	0
35350941	The Association Between Chronological Age and Maturity Status on Lower Body Clinical Measurements and Asymmetries in Elite Youth Tennis Players.	BACKGROUND: Tennis is one of the most popular sports among youths. At elite levels, a notable increase in injury incidence and a temporary decline in performance may occur when children progress through puberty. However, limited research has explored maturity-associated variations in clinical measurements suggested as predictors of injury and tennis performance in elite youth players.  Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to analyze the association between  chronological age and maturity status on several measures of neuromuscular capability and physical performance as well as bilateral (interlimb) asymmetries  in elite youth tennis players. HYPOTHESIS: Youth tennis players around peak height velocity (PHV) will show higher growth-related impairments or deficits in measures of neuromuscular capability and physical performance than their less (pre-PHV) and more (post-PHV) mature counterparts irrespective of sex. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4. METHODS: A total of 68 male (age, 13.7 ± 1.1 years; height, 162.4 ± 9.4 cm; body  mass, 51.4 ± 10.3 kg [Mean values ± SD]) and 60 female (age, 13.6 ± 1.1 years; height, 162.8 ± 7.2 cm; body mass, 52.7 ± 7.5 kg [Mean values ± SD]) elite youth  tennis players from 2 different age groups (under 13 [U13] and under 15 [U15]) and maturity status (pre-PHV, around PHV, and post-PHV), were tested during national training camps. Tests included the Y Balance Test, isometric hip abduction and adduction strength, hip ranges of motion (ROMs), and countermovement jump (CMJ) height. Bayesian analysis was used to establish any significant between-group differences. RESULTS: Only dynamic balance (in boys; Bayesian factor [BF10] = 88.2) and jump height (in both boys and girls; BF10 >100) were significatively associated with chronological age, whereby the U15 group showed lower Y Balance Test reach distances (-6%; standardized effect size δ = 0.62) but higher CMJ height scores (+18%; δ = 0.73) than the U13 group. Although boys jump higher (+11%; δ = 0.62) and were stronger in isometric hip adduction strength (+14%; δ = 0.92) than girls, the latter had greater hip internal ROM values (+15%; δ = 0.75). Furthermore, relevant maturity-associated effects (BF10 = 34.6) were solely observed for the CMJ test in boys, with the most mature players demonstrating higher jump height scores (+12%; δ = 0.93). Finally, a significant percentage (>25%) of tennis players, independent of sex, demonstrated bilateral asymmetries  in hip ROM, hip strength, and jump height values. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study show that in U13 and U15 male and female tennis players, there were neither positive nor negative maturity-associated variations in the clinical measurements analyzed (with the exception of jump height in male players). The high proportion of tennis players showing bilateral  asymmetries in dynamic balance, hip ROM, and strength and jump performance highlight the need of future studies to analyze these factors in relation to unilateral tennis-specific adaptations in the musculoskeletal and sensorimotor systems. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These results may help to better understand how different clinical measurements are associated with the process of growth and maturation in elite youth tennis players and may aid in the design of specific training interventions during these stages of development.	0
34780248	Genetics of Thoroughbred Racehorse Performance.	Thoroughbred horses have been selected for racing performance for more than 400 years. Despite continued selection, race times have not improved significantly during the past 60 years, raising the question of whether genetic variation for racing performance still exists. Studies using phenotypes such as race time, money earned, and handicapping, however, demonstrate that there is extensive variation within these traits and that they are heritable. Even so, these are poor measures of racing success since Thoroughbreds race at different ages and distances and on different types of tracks, and some may not race at all. With the advent of genomic tools, DNA variants are being identified that contribute to racing success. Aside from strong associations for myostatin variants with best racing distance, weak to modest associations with racing phenotypes are reported  for other genomic regions. These data suggest that diverse genetic strategies have contributed to producing a successful racehorse, and genetic variation contributing to athleticism remains important.	0
35280150	The Economic Cost of Burnout in Veterinary Medicine.	The purpose of this study is to estimate the economic cost of burnout in the veterinary profession and highlight the financial reasons why the industry should address the burnout crisis from an organizational perspective. Using data from 5,786 associate veterinarians in private practice, information was obtained using employment information related to compensation, work hours, hour preferences, and job turnover. Burnout was measured using the Professional Quality of Life Scale and used to calculate conditional probabilities on turnover and reduced working hours due to burnout. Lost revenue from each outcome (turnover and reduced working hours) was then used to calculate the economic costs to the veterinary services industry. The attributable cost of burnout of veterinarians to the US industry is between $1 and 2 billion annually in lost revenue, though there is a  large amount of uncertainty. The cost is dependent on whether veterinary technicians are included in the analysis. The highest economic cost per veterinarian is among food animal practitioners, while the lowest is among equine. This study demonstrates that there are significant economic costs due to  burnout among veterinarians and veterinary technicians. We suggest pursuing organizational interventions as these have shown the most impact in decreasing burnout and increasing satisfaction among human health physicians.	0
34715642	Pleistocene expansion, anthropogenic pressure and ocean currents: Disentangling the past and ongoing evolutionary history of Patella aspera Röding, 1798 in the archipelago of Madeira.	AIMS: Rising sea-level following the Last Glacial Maximum lead to fragmentation of coastal limpet populations between islands of the Archipelago of Madeira. This fragmentation is reinforced by recent heavy exploitation reducing effective population size on Madeira Island. We use the limpet P. aspera to understand how  the role of processes at different time scales (i.e. changes in the sea level and overexploitation) can influence the genetic composition of an extant species, relating these processes to reproductive phenology and seasonal shifts in ocean currents. LOCATION: Madeira Island, Porto Santo and Desertas (Archipelago of Madeira, NE Atlantic Ocean). TAXON: The limpet Patella aspera. METHODS: Twelve microsatellite genetic markers were used. A power analysis was used to evaluate the power of the microsatellite markers to detect a signal of population differentiation. Long-term past migrations were assessed using a Bayesian Markov Montecarlo approach in the software MIGRATE-n to estimate mutation-scaled migration rates (M = m/μ; m, probability of a lineage immigrating per generation; μ, mutation rate). Two scenarios were evaluated using an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) in the software DIYABC 2.1 (i) Scenario 1: considered a population scenario from a reduced Ne at time t3 to a higher Ne at time t2; and (ii) Scenario 2 considering a reduction of Ne from a time t3 to a time t2. RESULTS: Colonization of the archipelago by Portuguese settlers six centuries ago probably led to an important decrease in the genetic diversity of the species (Ne). Contemporary gene flow strongly support a pattern of high asymmetric connectivity explained by the reproductive phenology of the species and spatio-temporal seasonal changes in the ocean currents. Spatio-temporal reconstructions using Bayesian methods, including coalescent and Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approaches, suggest changes in the migration patterns  from highly symmetric to highly asymmetric connectivity with subtle population differentiation as consequence of post-glacial maximum sea level rise during the  Holocene. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that anthropogenic activity could have had  serious effects on the genetic diversity of heavily exploited littoral species since the end of the Pleistocene, probably accelerating in recent years.	0
35167731	Evaluation of the treatment of equine glandular gastric disease with either long-acting-injectable or oral omeprazole.	BACKGROUND: Equine glandular gastric disease (EGGD) is common in domesticated horses and can be challenging to treat. Oral omeprazole (ORLO) is used widely but the clinical response is frequently poor. OBJECTIVES: To compare rates of EGGD healing and improvement between ORLO and a long-acting injectable omeprazole preparation (LAIO). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study. METHODS: The case records and gastroscopy images of horses presenting to masked for peer review over a 12-month period were reviewed, with images blindly assessed by one of the authors. Treatment responses to 4 mg/kg LAIO administered  every 7 days for 2 and 4 weeks were compared with ORLO 4 mg/kg PO q24hrs for 4 weeks. Data were compared using a Mann-Whitney U test with post-hoc Dunn's test,  Chi-squared test and a Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Thirty-three horses that received LAIO and 12 that received ORLO were identified. Nine horses in the LAIO had received other treatments previously. The groups were comparable in signalment and EGGD lesion severity. Long-acting injectable omeprazole was found to be non-inferior to ORLO. LAIO was associated with better healing rates than ORLO at 4 weeks (LAIO-80%; ORLO-42%; p = 0.02), and reduction in lesion severity at 2 and 4 weeks in the LAIO group but not in the ORLO group at 4 weeks. Eighteen percent of horses in the LAIO group and 50% in the ORLO group did not heal at 4 weeks. There was no association between rate  of healing or improvement and resolution or improvement of clinical signs. Six localised and self-limiting injection site reactions were identified in 4 horses  treated with LAIO (6.7%). MAIN LIMITATIONS: Retrospective design, small numbers and the use of other treatments prior to use of LAIO. CONCLUSIONS: LAIO was found to be non-inferior to oral omeprazole for EGGD. Larger blinded randomised clinical trials are justified.	0
34893836	Analysis of Genetic Diversity in the American Standardbred Horse Utilizing Short  Tandem Repeats and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms.	American Standardbreds were developed as a harness racing horse breed. The United States Trotting Association closed the studbook in 1973 and implemented a book size cap in 2009. This study aimed to investigate genetic diversity in the American Standardbred after the studbook cap was introduced using short tandem repeats (STRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Sixteen STRs from all  horses foaled from 2010 to 2015 and their sires and dams (n=50,621) were utilized to examine allelic richness (Ar), expected heterozygosity (HE), observed heterozygosity (HO), unbiased heterozygosity (HU), inbreeding coefficient (FIS),  and fixation index (FST). These analyses found that trotting and pacing sires were less genetically diverse than dams (HE  pbonferroni=0.029 and 6.3x10 -5, respectively) and their offspring (Ar  pbonferroni=0.034 and 6.9x10 -6, respectively), and pacing offspring were significantly less diverse than their dams (HE  pbonferroni=2x10 -3). Inbreeding coefficients for trotters (FIS=-0.014) and pacers (FIS=-0.012) suggest that breeding practices have maintained diversity. Moderate levels of genetic differentiation (0.066<FST<0.11) were found between pacing and trotting groups. Additionally, ten of the most prolific trotting sires and their male offspring (n=84) were genotyped on the 670K Axiom Equine HD Array. HO values higher than HE (p<0.001), low inbreeding coefficients  (mean F=-0.064), and mean FROH=21% indicate relatively high levels of diversity in this cohort, further supporting the STR data. However, in contrast, HO values  were higher for trotting sires (0.41) than their offspring (0.36). This observation warrants further monitoring of diversity over time. These data provide an updated foundation of diversity indices for further, long-term analysis in the breed.	0
35035141	Identification and validation of reference genes for qRT-PCR based studies in horse gram (Macrotyloma uniflorum).	The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is the most sensitive and commonly used technique for gene expression studies in biological systems. However, the reliability of qRT-PCR results depends on the selection of  reference gene(s) for data normalization. Horse gram (Macrotyloma uniflorum) is an important legume crop on which several molecular studies have been reported. However, the stability of reference genes has not been evaluated. In the present  study, nine candidate reference genes were identified from horse gram RNA-seq data and evaluated in two horse gram genotypes, HPK4 and HPKM317 under six abiotic stresses viz. cold, drought, salinity, heat, abscisic acid and methyl viologen-induced oxidative stress. The results were evaluated using geNorm, Bestkeeper, Normfinder and delta-delta Ct methods and comprehensive ranking was assigned using RefFinder and RankAggreg software. The overall result showed that  TCTP was one of the most stable genes in all samples and in genotype HPK4, while  in HPKM317 profilin was most stably expressed. However, PSMA5 was identified as least stable in all the experimental conditions. Expression of target genes dehydrin and early response to dehydration 6 under drought stress was also validated using TCTP and profilin for data normalization, either alone or in combination, which confirmed their suitability for qRT-PCR data normalization. Thus, TCTP and profilin genes may be used for qRT-PCR data normalization for molecular and genomic studies in horse gram.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12298-021-01104-0.	0
35124154	Platelet Lysate Enhances Equine Skeletal Muscle Regeneration in A Bupivacaine-Induced Muscle Injury Model☆.	This study aimed to verify the effects of platelet lysate (PL) administration on  the repair of injured horse tissue. Skeletal muscle injuries were induced in 26 Thoroughbreds by bupivacaine administration. PL or saline was administered 1 day  (1D) after injury. Muscle samples from 22 horses injected with PL or saline were  obtained by needle biopsy at 2, 3, 4, or 7 days (2D, 3D, 4D, or 7D, respectively) after injury, and growth-factor concentrations and muscle regeneration-associated gene expression levels were determined. Intact samples were similarly collected before injury, and samples of injured muscle not treated with PL or saline (sham  samples) were also obtained at 1D, 2D, 3D, 4D, and 7D as references for comparison. Samples from the remaining 4 horses were obtained by surgical incision following euthanasia at 5 days (5D) and 7D after injury, followed by histological analysis. Although increased growth factor levels caused by PL administration were observed for up to 1-day post-administration (2D), gene expressions were enhanced for up to 6 days post-administration (7D). Moreover, the number of embryonic myosin heavy chain (MHC-e)-positive myofibrils at 5D was  higher in the PL-treated group than in the saline-treated group, whereas no significant between-group difference in the number of myofibrils was recorded at  7D. Thus, PL administration in muscle injury upregulated the expression of various genes associated with muscle regeneration and promoted morphological regeneration within 6 days of treatment, although growth factor levels from PL decreased at the injected site by approximately 2 days post-administration.	0
34556604	Toe white line separation associated with the notch (crena marginalis) on the distal phalanges in Thoroughbred yearling horses.	The shape of the white line of the hoof is closely related to the shape of the notch on the dorsal distal bearing border of the distal phalanx (P3). In this study, a radiographic survey of the P3 of both forelimbs of 163 Thoroughbred yearling horses was conducted. The correlation of the depth and width of the notch were analyzed with the toe white line separation grades (0 to 3). As a result, the toe white line separation grade increased, the depth and the width of the notch also increased significantly. Radiographic examination of the P3 of the forelimbs might be useful for deciding whether to implement hoof care to prevent  onset of toe white line separation.	0
34946933	Identification of W13 in the American Miniature Horse and Shetland Pony Populations.	Coat color is a trait of economic significance in horses. Variants in seven genes have been documented to cause white patterning in horses. Of the 34 variants that have been identified in KIT proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT), 27 have only been reported in a single individual or family and thus not all are routinely offered for genetic testing. Therefore, to enable proper use of marker-assisted selection, determining breed specificity for these alleles is warranted. Screening 19 unregistered all-white Shetland ponies for 16 white patterning markers identified 14 individuals whose phenotype could not be explained by testing results. In evaluating other known dominant white variants,  14 horses were heterozygous for W13. W13 was previously only reported in two quarter horses and a family of Australian miniature horses. Genotyping known white spotting variants in 30 owner-reported white animals (25 Miniature Horses and five Shetland ponies) identified two additional W13/N American Miniature Horses. The estimated allele frequency of W13 in the American Miniature Horse was 0.0063 (79 N/N, 1 W13/N) and the allele was not detected in a random sample (n =  59) of Shetland ponies. No homozygous W13 individuals were identified and W13/N ponies had a similar all-white coat with pink skin phenotype, regardless of the other white spotting variants present, demonstrating that W13 results in a Mendelian inherited dominant white phenotype and homozygosity is likely lethal. These findings document the presence of W13 in the American Miniature Horse and Shetland pony populations at a low frequency and illustrate the importance of testing for this variant in additional breeds.	0
35091745	Impaired intrauterine growth in the context of maternal hookworm infection during gestation.	Hookworm infection is associated with poor nutritional outcomes, anemia and impaired cognitive performance. We examined the association between maternal hookworm infection and birth outcomes in a cohort of women in Leyte, Philippines. We observed poor intrauterine growth characteristics associated with maternal hookworm only among male offspring, with lower birth weight, head circumferences  and placental surface area. Males also had higher IGF2 and lower adiponectin in cord blood. These data intriguingly suggest nutritional impacts of maternal hookworm infection during pregnancy may be divergent based on sex of the offspring.	0
34808328	Risk factors for jockey falls in Japanese Thoroughbred jump racing.	Jockey safety is an important subject from a welfare perspective and public perception. This is the first retrospective case-control study that aims to identify risk factors associated with jockey falls (JF) in Thoroughbred jump races held by the Japan Racing Association (JRA). JF in 17,459 maiden-class race  starts at eight racecourses from 2003 to 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Data were extracted from a database and official accident reports maintained by the JRA. Thirteen possible risk factors were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression to identify those that were significantly associated with JF. A total  of 724 JF were recorded, with an incidence rate of 41.5 falls per 1,000 starts (95% CI: 38.6-44.5). Final model included stable, horse age, year, season, course, horse sex, horse experience, and jockey experience. No two-way interactions were observed. Six risk factors were significantly associated with JF: Year (2003-2007 or 2008-2012 > 2013-2017; P = .0011), season (spring, autumn, or winter > summer; P = .0006), course type (dual direction > single direction; P < .0001), horse sex (female > male or gelding; P = .0003), horse experience (inexperienced horse > experienced horse; P < .0001) and jockey experience (apprentice jockey > experienced jockey; P = .0332) significantly affected the odds of JF. In agreement with overseas reports, our results suggest that the occurrence of JF is multifactorial and associated with jockey- and horse-related  factors as well as environmental factors. To safeguard the welfare of jockeys, implementation of measures according to identified risk factors is recommended.	0
35368402	Packed cell volume and heart rate to predict medical and surgical cases and their short-term survival in horses with gastrointestinal-induced colic.	The objective of this prospective case-control study of 125 horses with gastrointestinal tract-induced colic was to determine whether heart rate (HR) and packed cell volume (PCV) can predict surgical versus medical treatment and its short-term survival (time of discharge of the patient). Sixty-four horses were treated medically and 61 surgically (29 small intestinal and 32 large intestinal  cases). At admission, both PCV and HR were higher in horses treated surgically than in horses treated medically; however, with longer duration of colic before presentation, the PCV was higher in the small intestinal surgical group only. In  addition, both PCV and HR were higher, and the duration of colic was longer in non-survivors compared to survivors. Binary logistic regression demonstrated a significant association between HR and type of treatment, and both HR and PCV were predictive of survival. Simple parameters such as HR and PCV provide useful  information for management of colic cases.	0
34973368	Antibody Responses to a Reverse Genetics-Derived Bivalent Inactivated Equine Influenza Vaccine in Thoroughbred Horses.	Updating vaccine strains is important to control equine influenza (EI). Previously, we reported that a monovalent inactivated EI vaccine derived from a virus generated by reverse genetics (RG) elicited immunogenicity in horses. In the present study, we compared antibody responses to a bivalent inactivated EI vaccine generated by RG and a commercially available bivalent inactivated EI (CO) vaccine derived from wild-type equine influenza viruses in Thoroughbred horses. The CO vaccine contained A/equine/Ibaraki/1/2007 (Florida sub-lineage clade 1) and A/equine/Yokohama/aq13/2010 (Florida sub-lineage clade 2) as vaccine strains. We generated two RG viruses possessing the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes  from A/equine/Ibaraki/1/2007 or A/equine/Yokohama/aq13/2010. These viruses were inactivated by formalin, and the hemagglutinin titer of the RG vaccine was adjusted to be the same as that of the CO vaccine. Sixteen unvaccinated yearlings (7 for the RG vaccine group and 9 for the CO vaccine group) received two doses of a primary vaccination course four weeks apart. Thirty-two vaccinated adult horses (18 in the RG-vaccinated group and 14 in the CO vaccine group) received a single  dose of a booster vaccination. The patterns of hemagglutination inhibition antibody response to the primary and booster vaccinations were similar for the RG and CO groups in unvaccinated yearlings and vaccinated adult horses. These results suggest that a bivalent vaccine derived from RG viruses elicits equivalent immunogenicity to that elicited by a CO vaccine derived from wild-type viruses. RG viruses can, therefore, be used in multivalent as well as monovalent  vaccines for horses.	0
34943238	Genomic Analysis of 18th-Century Kazakh Individuals and Their Oral Microbiome.	The Asian Central Steppe, consisting of current-day Kazakhstan and Russia, has acted as a highway for major migrations throughout history. Therefore, describing the genetic composition of past populations in Central Asia holds value to understanding human mobility in this pivotal region. In this study, we analyse paleogenomic data generated from five humans from Kuygenzhar, Kazakhstan. These individuals date to the early to mid-18th century, shortly after the Kazakh Khanate was founded, a union of nomadic tribes of Mongol Golden Horde and Turkic  origins. Genomic analysis identifies that these individuals are admixed with varying proportions of East Asian ancestry, indicating a recent admixture event from East Asia. The high amounts of DNA from the anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria Tannerella forsythia, a periodontal pathogen, recovered from their teeth suggest  they may have suffered from periodontitis disease. Genomic analysis of this bacterium identified recently evolved virulence and glycosylation genes including the presence of antibiotic resistance genes predating the antibiotic era. This study provides an integrated analysis of individuals with a diet mostly based on  meat (mainly horse and lamb), milk, and dairy products and their oral microbiome.	0
34974118	Clinical and pathological examination of mycotoxicosis as an associated risk factor for colic in equine.	A retrospective cohort study was conducted on two Egyptian horse farms with most  of horses were suffered from abdominal pain to describe the associations between  the occurrence of mycotoxicosis and equine colic. The farms owner complain was an unexpected increase in number of colic cases and deaths among horses. The association between colic and risk factors (sex, type of food either dry or mixed with roughages and hematobiochemical parameters) was compared using independent sample T-test. The associations between possible prognostic indicators for colic  caused by mycotoxicosis was estimated using logistic regression analysis model. The cumulative incidence, incidence rates for colic attacks, survival rate among  diseased horses were additionally estimated. Our results showed that a total of 24 out of the 132 horses suffered from colic due to feeding of ration contaminated with high percent of mycotoxin including Aflatoxins, Ochratoxins and or fusarium mycotoxins. The total cumulative incidence of colic due to mycotoxicosis was 19.7%. The horses fed on dry rations had more chance of developing colic than horses fed on mixed rations (P < 0.05). The overall incidence rate of colic due to mycotoxicosis was estimated at 18 colic attack/1000 horse/month. The mortality rate of horses suffered from colic due to  mycotoxicosis was estimated at 5.9% (5/85), while the case fatality rate was estimated at 25% (n = 5/20). Inconclusion, our results showed that mycotoxicosis  are considered an important risks factor for colic cases development in equine practice.	0
34612517	Biallelic TMEM260 variants cause truncus arteriosus, with or without renal defects.	Only two families have been reported with biallelic TMEM260 variants segregating  with structural heart defects and renal anomalies syndrome (SHDRA). With a combination of genome, exome sequencing and RNA studies, we identified eight individuals from five families with biallelic TMEM260 variants. Variants included one multi-exon deletion, four nonsense/frameshifts, two splicing changes and one  missense change. Together with the published cases, analysis of clinical data revealed ventricular septal defects (12/12), mostly secondary to truncus arteriosus (10/12), elevated creatinine levels (6/12), horse-shoe kidneys (1/12)  and renal cysts (1/12) in patients. Three pregnancies were terminated on detection of severe congenital anomalies. Six patients died between the ages of 6 weeks and 5 years. Using a range of stringencies, carrier frequency for SHDRA was estimated at 0.0007-0.007 across ancestries. In conclusion, this study confirms the genetic basis of SHDRA, expands its known mutational spectrum and clarifies its clinical features. We demonstrate that SHDRA is a severe condition  associated with substantial mortality in early childhood and characterised by congenital cardiac malformations with a variable renal phenotype.	0
34621931	Dataset of single nucleotide polymorphisms and comprehensive proteomic analysis of Streptococcus equi subsp. equi ATCC 39506.	"Streptococcus equi subspecies equi (S. equi) is an opportunistic pathogen and a major causative agent of equine strangles, a contagious respiratory infection in  horses and other equines. In this study, we provide the dataset associated with our research publication ""Streptococcus equi-derived extracellular vesicles as a  vaccine candidate against Streptococcus equi infections"" [1]. We describe the genomic differences between S. equi 4047 and S. equi ATCC 39506 and outline the comprehensive proteome information of various fractions, including the whole cell lysate, membrane proteome, secretory proteome, and extracellular vesicle proteome. In addition, we included a dataset of highly immunoreactive proteins identified through immunoprecipitation. The specifications table provides a detailed summary of the gene annotation and quantitative information obtained for each proteome. The proteomics data were analyzed using shotgun proteomics with LTQ Velos and Q Exactive mass spectrometry in the data-dependent acquisition mode. We have deposited the acquired data, including the mass spectrometry raw files and exported MASCOT search results, in the PRIDE public repository under the accession numbers PXD025152 and PXD025527."	0
34444402	The Potential Role of Hamstring Extensibility on Sagittal Pelvic Tilt, Sagittal Spinal Curves and Recurrent Low Back Pain in Team Sports Players: A Gender Perspective Analysis.	It is assumed that mechanical restriction of hamstring tightness disrupts sagittal spine-pelvis-leg alignment and alters the lumbar-pelvic rhythm predisposing to low back pain (LBP) in athletes; however, this association is not clear. A prospective cross-sectional cohort study was conducted to determine the  influence of hamstring extensibility (HE) on sagittal pelvic tilt, sagittal spinal curves, and LBP in 94 soccer and basketball players (61 man and 33 woman)  with (n = 36) and without recurrent LBP (n = 58). Descriptive analysis displayed  significant gender differences for HE, sagittal pelvic tilt, and lumbar curve. Differences were found between the low-HE and high-HE groups in lumbosacral angle in for the maximum trunk forward flexion (LH-MTFP). Low-HE was associated with LH-MTFP, lumbar curve and LBP in male players (p ≤ 0.023). In female players, LH-MTFP and lumbar curve were associated with low-HE (p ≤ 0.020). Low-HE predicted LH-MTFP (p = 0.000; OR = 65.6950) and LBP (p = 0.028; OR = 13.915) in male players. The decision tree analysis showed that 50.8% of the players were classified with restricted LH-MTFP, 77.4% with low-HE among male players. The 100% of male players with recurrent LBP had low-HE. The 65% of female players with low-HE had restricted LH-MTFP. Measurement of HE, lumbar curve, and LH-MTFP  are important in making training decisions for to reduce the incidence of recurrent LBP in soccer and basketball players.	0
35062868	Performance of Swedish Warmblood fragile foal syndrome carriers and breeding prospects.	BACKGROUND: Warmblood fragile foal syndrome (WFFS) is a monogenetic defect caused by a recessive lethal missense point mutation in the procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 1 gene (PLOD1, c.2032G>A). The majority of homozygous WFFS horses are aborted during gestation. Clinical signs of affected horses include fragile skin, skin and mucosa lacerations, hyperextension of the articulations, and hematomas. In spite of its harmful effect, a relatively high frequency of WFFS carriers has been found in Warmblood horses, suggesting a heterozygote advantage. Thus, in this study our aims were to: (1) estimate the frequency of WFFS carriers in the Swedish Warmblood breed (SWB), (2) estimate the effect of WFFS carrier genotype on performance traits in two SWB subpopulations bred for different disciplines, and (3) simulate the potential effects of balancing selection and different selection strategies on the frequency of carriers. METHODS: In total, 2288 SWB sport horses born between 1971 and 2020 were tested for the WFFS mutation and had estimated breeding values (EBV) for ten traditional evaluating and 50 linear descriptive traits. RESULTS: The frequency of WFFS carriers calculated from a pool of 511 randomly selected SWB horses born in 2017 was equal to 7.4% and ranged from 0.0 to 12.0% among the whole set of tested SWB horses, starting from 1971 till 2020. The effect of the WFFS carrier genotype was significant for several EBV mainly related to movements and dressage traits and especially for horses not bred for the show jumping discipline. Using simulation, we showed that balancing selection can maintain a recessive lethal allele in populations such as the SWB breed over  generations and that the frequency is expected to slowly decrease in absence of balancing selection. Finally, we showed that selection against carrier sires can  result in a more rapid decrease of the frequency of the mutant allele over time. CONCLUSION: Further research is needed to confirm the apparent association between equine performance and the WFFS carrier genotype. Identification of such  associations or new causative mutations for horse performance traits can serve as new tools in horse breeding to select for healthy, sustainable, and better performing horses.	0
34530895	15q26 deletion in a patient with congenital heart defect, growth restriction and  intellectual disability: case report and literature review.	BACKGROUND: 15q26 deletion is a relatively rare chromosomal disorder, and it is described only in few cases. Patients with this aberration show many signs and symptoms, particularly pre- and postnatal growth restriction, developmental delay, microcephaly, intellectual disability and various congenital malformations. CASE PRESENTATION: We report on a girl, 4 years old, of consanguineous parents, with a 15q26 deletion. Clinical manifestations included failure to thrive, developmental delay, microcephaly, dysmorphic facies with broad forehead, hypertelorism, narrowed eyelid slits and protruding columella. The patient also showed skeletal abnormalities, especially clinodactyly of the 5th finger, varus equine right foot and left club foot. Additionally, she had teething delay and divergent strabismus. Heart ultrasound displayed two atrial septal defects with left-to-right shunt, enlarging the right cavities. Routine cytogenetic analysis revealed a shortened 15q chromosome. Subsequent array analysis disclosed a terminal 9.15 Mb deletion at subband 15q26.1-q26.3. Four candidate genes associated with 15q26 deletion phenotype were within the deleted region, i.e. IGF1R, NR2F2, CHD2 and MEF2A. CONCLUSION: We report on an additional case of 15q26 monosomy, characterized by array-CGH. Molecular cytogenetic analysis allowed us to identify the exact size of the deletion, and four candidate genes for genotype-phenotype correlation. 15q26 monosomy should be considered when growth retardation is associated with hearing anomalies and congenital heart defect, especially atrioventricular septal defects (AVSDs) and/or aortic arch anomaly (AAA).	0
34655811	Duplication of blaCTX-M-1 and a class 1 integron on the chromosome enhances antimicrobial resistance in Escherichia coli isolated from racehorses in Japan.	OBJECTIVES: Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae have become a cause for great concern. Although some studies have reported the prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria and ESBL-encoding genes in horses worldwide, the genetic structure surrounding the ESBL gene has not been analysed  in detail. In the present study, we isolated two ESBL-producing Escherichia coli  strains from diseased racehorses in Japan and demonstrated the mechanisms underlying the acquisition of their antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. METHODS: Two ESBL-producing E. coli strains (E148 and E189) were isolated from the heart and liver of horses with endocarditis and sepsis in 2014 and 2016, respectively, in Japan. Complete genomic sequences of the two strains were analysed using a PacBio RSII sequencer. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was  performed by the agar dilution method. RESULTS: The two isolates possessed a chromosomal AMR gene cluster containing blaCTX-M-1 that was similar to the pEQ1 plasmid found in E. coli isolated from a  racehorse in the Czech Republic. In one of the two strains, tandem duplication of the 16-kb region containing blaCTX-M-1 and a class 1 integron, which occurred via IS26-mediated recombination, increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) associated with the duplicated AMR genes. CONCLUSION: Chromosomal blaCTX-M-1 possibly derived from the pEQ1 or pEQ1-like plasmid was found in Japanese equine E. coli isolates. In Japanese strains, many  AMR genes containing blaCTX-M-1 and the class 1 integron are highly accumulated in one region on the chromosome, and the AMR of E. coli was enhanced via the IS26-mediated duplication of the AMR gene cluster.	0
34864361	Assessment of anti-Müllerian hormone in mares' transitional period and in relation to fertility in elderly mares.	"Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) has been linked to reproductive tract abnormalities  in mares and stallions. This study aimed at evaluating AMH as a biomarker for two reproductive conditions in mares. In the first part of this study, plasma AMH was evaluated as an early indicator of the onset of cyclicity in mares in the transitional period from the anovulatory phase during winter anoestrus to the cyclic phase during the breeding season. Ten mares between 8 and 17 years old were included in the experiment which lasted from mid-February until the end of April. Ovarian activity was monitored with ultrasonography three times per week,  the detection of a corpus haemorrhagicum/luteum was documented and antral follicle counts (AFC) were recorded. Blood samples were collected weekly by jugular venipuncture during the whole study period to compare AMH concentrations  before and after the first ovulation of the year. The second objective was to evaluate if plasma AMH concentrations in middle-aged mares are linked to fertility and could serve as a prognostic marker in that age group. A total of 41 privately-owned clinically sound mares aged between 12 and 21 years of various breeds were inseminated with fresh or frozen semen. Mares were scanned between day 14 and 20 and the ""early pregnancy rate"" included only positive pregnancy examinations after the first observed cycle in the season of each mare. Potential associations between the early pregnancy rate in the first cycle and the explanatory factors AMH concentrations, age, status of the mare, stud, development of post-breeding endometritis, number of inseminations and semen type were analysed using logistic regression models. In the first part of the study, correlation between AMH and AFC for the whole study period (P = 0.0002, ρ = 0.55) as well as prior to (P = 0.008, ρ = 0.58) and after the first ovulation (P = 0.0007, ρ = 0.69) were observed. However, AMH concentrations before and after the first ovulation of the year were not statistically different. The second part of the study revealed no association between early pregnancy rate and AMH concentrations or any of the other mentioned factors. In conclusion, this study showed no evidence of a difference between AMH concentrations before and after the first ovulation of the year thus not supporting the use of AMH as a biomarker to predict the onset of cyclicity in mares. We could furthermore not show a relationship between plasma AMH concentrations and early pregnancy rates in this cohort of animals."	0
35431284	Investigation of multiple Felis catus papillomavirus types (-1/-2/-3/-4/-5/-6) DNAs in feline oral squamous cell carcinoma: a multicentric study.	Recent evidence suggests a possible association of Felis catus papillomavirus type 2 (FcaPV-2) DNA with feline oral squamous cell carcinoma (FOSCC). In this study, type-specific PCR targeting two genes (L1/E6 or E1/E6) of FcaPV-1/-2/-3/-4/-5/-6 was performed to detect viral DNA in a large amount of FOSCC samples collected in Italy and Austria. FcaPV-1/-2/-3/-4/-5 were detected in 7/113 (6.2%), 7/93 (7.5%), 6/113 (5.3%), 1/113 (0.9%) and 2/113 (1.8%) specimens, respectively, with different prevalences in Italian vs Austrian samples, whilst FcaPV-6 went undetected. Our results confirms that FcaPV-2 is the most prevalent in FOSCC, followed by FcaPV-1/-3 and suggest that FcaPVs have variable circulation rates in European countries.	0
35283854	Microbial Biofilms Along a Geochemical Gradient at the Shallow-Water Hydrothermal System of Vulcano Island, Mediterranean Sea.	Shallow water hydrothermal vents represent highly dynamic environments where strong geochemical gradients can shape microbial communities. Recently, these systems are being widely used for investigating the effects of ocean acidification on biota as vent emissions can release high CO2 concentrations causing local pH reduction. However, other gas species, as well as trace elements and metals, are often released in association with CO2 and can potentially act as confounding factors. In this study, we evaluated the composition, diversity and inferred functional profiles of microbial biofilms in Levante Bay (Vulcano Island, Italy, Mediterranean Sea), a well-studied shallow-water hydrothermal vent system. We analyzed 16S rRNA transcripts from biofilms exposed to different intensity of hydrothermal activity, following a redox and pH gradient across the  bay. We found that elevated CO2 concentrations causing low pH can affect the response of bacterial groups and taxa by either increasing or decreasing their relative abundance. H2S proved to be a highly selective factor shaping the composition and affecting the diversity of the community by selecting for sulfide-dependent, chemolithoautotrophic bacteria. The analysis of the 16S rRNA transcripts, along with the inferred functional profile of the communities, revealed a strong influence of H2S in the southern portion of the study area, and temporal succession affected the inferred abundance of genes for key metabolic pathways. Our results revealed that the composition of the microbial assemblages  vary at very small spatial scales, mirroring the highly variable geochemical signature of vent emissions and cautioning for the use of these environments as models to investigate the effects of ocean acidification on microbial diversity.	0
35023993	Equine nonneoplastic abnormal ovary in a draft mare with high serum anti-Müllerian hormone: a case study.	We performed a standing hand-assisted laparoscopic ovariectomy in a draft mare that presented with high serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) level and had an enlarged single cystic ovary. Histopathological examination revealed no tumor cell proliferation in the ovary, but the presence of a large ovarian cyst was confirmed. In the diagnosis of abnormal ovaries in mares, a comprehensive assessment should be performed, including the monitoring of ovarian morphology and biomarkers over time, to determine the disease prognosis and treatment plan.  The case of this mare with a nonneoplastic abnormal ovary and increased serum AMH level was rare. We suggest that standing hand-assisted laparoscopic ovariectomy is useful for the removal of large ovaries in draft mares.	0
35197397	Characteristic computed tomographic myelography findings in 23 Thoroughbred horses.	The purpose of this observational study was to determine the characteristic computed tomographic (CT) myelography findings of cervical vertebral stenotic myelopathy (CVSM) lesions in Thoroughbred horses. A total of 23 Thoroughbred horses (age range, 155-717 days on CT examination; mean, 410.9 days) were analyzed. All 23 Thoroughbred horses underwent unenhanced radiography, radiographic myelography, and CT myelography. Unenhanced radiographs were observed the presence of cervical vertebral malalignment and osseous lesions. Radiographic myelograms were observed for signs of cervical spinal cord compression; additionally, CT myelograms were used to detect cervical vertebral osseous lesions. Ventral compressions were frequently observed in the cranial cervical vertebrae (C2-C4), whereas dorsal compressions were frequently observed  in the caudal cervical vertebrae (C5-C7). Furthermore, osseous lesions of the caudal articular process developed more frequently than those of the cranial articular process. CT myelography in Thoroughbred horses is a useful method for detecting CVSM changes.	0
34520465	Lack of effect on in-hospital mortality of drugs used during COVID-19 pandemic: Findings of the retrospective multicenter COVOCA study.	INTRODUCTION: During COVID-19 pandemic, the use of several drugs has represented  the worldwide clinical practice. However, though the current increase of knowledge about the disease, there is still no effective treatment for the usage  of drugs. Thus, we retrospectively assessed use and effects of therapeutic regimens in hospitalized patients on in-hospital mortality. METHODS: COVOCA is a retrospective observational cohort study on 18 COVID centres throughout Campania Region Hospitals. We included adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, discharged/dead between March/June 2020. RESULTS: 618 patients were included, with an overall in-hospital cumulative mortality incidence of 23.1%. Most prescribed early treatments were antivirals (72%), antibiotics (65%) and hydroxychloroquine/anticoagulants (≈50%). Tocilizumab, indeed, was largely prescribed late during hospitalization. Multivariable models, with a cut-off at day 2 for early COVID-19 therapy administration, did not disclose any significant association of a single drug administration on the clinical outcome. DISCUSSION: COVOCA represents the first multicenter database in Campania region.  None drug class used during the pandemic significantly modified the outcome, regardless of therapy beginning, both overall and net of those already in non-invasive ventilation (NIV)/ orotracheal intubation (OTI) at hospitalization.  Our cumulative incidence of mortality seems lower than other described during the same period, particularly in Northern Italy.	0
34937842	Relationship between the ultrasonographic findings of suspected superficial digital flexor tendon injury and the prevalence of subsequent severe superficial  digital flexor tendon injuries in Thoroughbred horses: a retrospective study.	The onset of severe injury to the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) is extremely difficult to predict from slight changes in ultrasonographic findings in cases with no apparent clinical signs. This study investigated the relationship between an increased cross-sectional area (CSA) or edema in the subcutaneous tissue around the tendon and the subsequent onset of severe SDFT injury in Thoroughbred racehorses. Horses were classified into three groups based on ultrasound diagnosis (USD) findings: Group A included cases with enlarged tendons; Group B included cases with tendons of normal size but with prominent edema in the peritendinous tissue; and Group C (control group) included cases with no abnormal USD findings. The incidence of subsequent severe tendon injury was significantly higher in the horses in Groups A (25.7%, 28/101) and B (28.3%,  65/212) than in those in Group C (4.9%, 2/41). There were no significant differences in the median period and the median number of races from the first examination to the subsequent tendon injury between Groups A (140 days, 1 race) and B (120 days, 1 race). The results of this study revealed that horses with increased CSA and peritendinous edema are likely to suffer a subsequent severe tendon injury. Also, these two USD findings, i.e., increased CSA and peritendinous edema, indicate the risk of onset of severe SDFT injury.	0
34880567	Traumatic and non-traumatic spinal cord injury: Demographic characteristics, neurological and functional outcomes. A 7-year single centre experience.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate demographic and clinical characteristics of a population affected by traumatic and non-traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) and to analyze functional outcomes after rehabilitation. METHODS: This study involved 112 SCI patients (75 male and 37 female) admitted at the Neurorehabilitation Unit of the University Hospital of Messina. The neurological outcomes were evaluated according to the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) and by using length of stay, Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and Barthel Index (BI). RESULTS: NT-SCI patients were significantly older, numerous (75,89%) and affected by greater lesions when admitted, than T-SCI ones. Most of lesions were incomplete (93%) and associated with paraplegia (71%). FIM and BI outcomes are similar in both groups, even if T-SCI patients showed greater improvement when discharged. No significant differences were found in the length of stay. The most common complication in non-traumatic SCI group was urinary tract infection and this was observed in 25 patients (29,41%). Linear regression models explained 26% of the variance of LOS and 38% of the variance of functional outcome. Functional  status on admission was the strongest determinant of LOS and completeness of the  lesion was the strongest determinant of functional outcome. Etiology (traumatic versus non-traumatic) was a weak independent determinant of LOS but was not an independent determinant of functional outcome. CONCLUSION: SCI patient's rehabilitation should be carried out by taking into account etiology of the injury. It is important to consider this information while developing the targets and planning of the rehabilitation program. In particular, older age negatively influence the degree of disability on admission  and the entity of functional recovery in both populations. Non-traumatic lesions  could have minor benefits after rehabilitation therapy if compared with traumatic ones.	0
34539211	Persistence of virus-neutralizing antibodies in horses inoculated with two doses  of a live equine herpesvirus type 1 vaccine with different vaccination intervals.	The antibody response in horses inoculated with 2 doses of a live equine herpesvirus type 1 vaccine with different vaccination intervals (1 to 3 months) was evaluated with regard to the persistence of virus-neutralizing (VN) antibodies. The durations for which the geometric mean VN titers were maintained  significantly higher than those before the first vaccination (P<0.05) were up to  5 months in horses that received the vaccination with a 1-month interval (n=17) and 7 months for those that received it with a 2-month (n=17) or 3-month interval (n=14 or 17). The vaccination program with the 2-month interval was the most effective in maintaining VN antibodies for a long duration with the smallest gap  of antibody decline between the first and second vaccinations.	0
34801788	DPF3, A Putative Candidate Gene For Melanoma Etiopathogenesis in Gray Horses.	Melanoma prevalence in gray horses reaches up to 50% and more. Several studies have documented a genetic melanoma predisposition which is referred to the 4.6 kb duplication in intron 6 of STX17 and its surrounding haplotype. However, the genetic background and mechanisms responsible for differences in etiopathogenesis of equine dermal melanomatosis still remain unknown. In the current study, we performed a genome wide association analysis in 141 Lipizzan horses and subsequently identified one candidate gene on chromosome 24 putatively involved in melanoma pathogenesis in gray horses. The associated SNP was located in the intronic region of DPF3, a gene which is involved in humans in cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis and motility of cancer cells. The replication study in 1210 horses from seven breeds demonstrated, that the G/G genotype of the DPF3 associated SNP exhibits putative melanoma suppression effects. As a conclusion DPF3 represents a candidate gene, which might play an essential role for gray horses coping with high genetic melanoma related tumor load.	0
34673473	Co-infection with Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma brucei is a significant  risk factor for cerebral trypanosomosis in the equid population of the Gambia.	Trypanosomosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in working equids in The Gambia. Recently, a progressive, severe neurological syndrome characterised by a diffuse lymphoplasmacytic meningoencephalitis has been identified and associated with Trypanosoma brucei infection of the central nervous system. The pathogenesis of cerebral trypanosomosis is unclear and the clinical syndrome not  well described. This observational cross-sectional study aimed to identify host and parasite related risk factors associated with the development of cerebral trypanosomosis and to describe the neurological syndrome associated with cerebral trypanosomosis. History, signalment, clinical and laboratory parameters were collected from 326 horses and donkeys presented to The Gambia Horse and Donkey Trust. Neurological derangements in affected animals were described. Species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Trypanosoma congolense, Trypanosoma vivax and Trypanosoma brucei was performed. The associations between  signalment, clinical and laboratory parameters and PCR results were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. The overall prevalence of trypanosomosis was 50 %, with infections dominated by T. congolense (44.1 %) and a lower intensity of T. brucei (7.4 %) and T. vivax (6.5 %). Overall, 54.8 % of neurological cases were PCR positive for trypanosomosis. Within the neurological  sub-population prevalence remained similar to the whole population for T. congolense (48.4 %) and T. vivax (6.5 %); whilst the prevalence increased markedly for T. brucei (32.3 %). Co-infections were identified in 32.3 % of neurological cases. Donkeys typically presented with progressive cerebral dysfunction and cranial nerve deficits, whereas in horses a progressive spinal ataxia was predominant. Mortality in affected animals was high (82.4 %). The final multivariable model identified a significant association between body condition score ≤2 (OR 11.4; 95 % CI 4.6-27.9; P = <0.001), and T. congolense and T. brucei. coinfection (OR 20.6; 95 % CI 1.71-244.1; P = 0.016) with the presence of neurological deficits. This study has provided clinically relevant information confirming the link between T. brucei and neurological disease outbreak in the equid population of The Gambia, and crucially identified co-infection with T. brucei and T. congolense as a major risk factor for the development of neurological trypanosomosis. Further research is required to identify the epidemiology of co-infection in equidae of The Gambia, so that cerebral trypanosomosis can be better prevented in this vulnerable population.	0
34714153	Personalized Medicine for Kidney Transplantation: Association of Graft Survival and Acute Transplant Rejection with Genetic Variation in B Cell Activating Factor System Signaling.	Kidney transplantation (KT) clinical outcomes are highly variable across patients and would benefit from predictive biomarkers to achieve personalized/precision medicine. The B cell activating factor (BAFF) system signaling plays an essential role in B lymphocytes' homeostasis, and is implicated in activation and survival  of B lymphocytes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BAFF system genes are therefore strong candidates to identify the genetic mechanisms underpinning variable clinical outcomes in KT. We report here new findings on BAFF system genetic polymorphisms in KT patients in relation to two key phenotypes of clinical interest: graft survival and acute rejection (AR). A total of 168 KT patients, of which 29 suffered AR, participated in this study. The BAFF system polymorphisms in five genes TNFSF13B, TNFSF13, TNFRSF13C, TNFRSF13B, and TNFRSF17 were characterized using TaqMan SNP genotyping. Patients with KT who had an AA genotype in polymorphism rs3803800 of the TNFSF13 gene had a higher risk of suffering AR (p = 0.046; odds ratios = 3.38, 95% CI: 1.02-11.2). Moreover, patients with AA genotype (rs3803800) in the TNFSF13 gene had a significantly lower AR-free time than the GG/GA genotypes (69.2% vs. 85.7%; p = 0.037). Of importance, bioinformatics analysis showed that the polymorphism rs3803800 could  alter splicing regulation and affect the proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) expression levels. The analysis of graft survival did not show a significant association with the polymorphisms analyzed in this study. In conclusion, the rs3803800 genetic polymorphism from this study of BAFF system genes appears to display importance in AR-free time for KT patients, and thus, warrants further research in independent populations as a putative predictive biomarker of AR. These findings also inform future personalized/precision medicine efforts and functional genomic studies in KT patients.	0
34967284	Evaluation of Antibodies Directed Against Two GPCRs, Anti-AT1R and Anti-ETAR, on  Kidney Transplant Outcome.	BACKGROUND: The role of an alloimmune response against non-self-antigens is established in organ transplantation. HLA incompatibilities are mainly responsible for this recognition between donor and recipient, but they may also be involved in the reactivity against other alloantigens expressed on the allograft resulting from an autoimmune response developed against selfantigens. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to determine the presence of non-anti-HLA antibodies (anti-AT1R and anti-ETAR) in sera from patients with end-stage renal disease, who underwent kidney transplantation in pre- and post-transplantation samples to study their influence on the development and evolution of acute humoral rejections and DSAs. METHODS: Antibodies (Abs) against two G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and endothelin-1 type A receptor (ETAR), have been detected in the sera of transplant recipients, who experience allograft dysfunction, patients with coronary heart disease, marginal hypertension and refractory, vascular lesions, myocardial hypertrophy and chronic inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis or sclerosis. RESULTS: Kidney graft recipients were monitored for anti-ETAR, -AT1R, and -HLA Abs in pre-and post-transplant evolution, and anti-AT1R and/or -ETAR Abs were detected in 24% of recipients (22.4% with anti-AT1R Abs and 9.8% with anti-ETAR Abs). Due to acute humoral rejection, Graft loss was detected in 6.4% of patients with anti-GPCRs non-HLA Abs, and 3.2% had DSA anti-HLA Abs. In this research, we  have described how the function of the anti-GPCRs autoAbs and how these Abs that  activate GPCRs could influence graft outcome. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, there is a high association of non-HLA anti-GPCRs Abs  levels with reduced kidney function after transplantation, especially in the presence of DSA anti-HLA Abs. Although more studies are needed, anti-AT1R and anti-ETAR antibodies may be helpful biomarkers that allow the risk of graft loss  to be assessed.	0
34649126	The enteroinsular axis during hospitalization in newborn foals.	The enteroinsular axis (EIA) is an energy regulatory system that modulates insulin secretion through the release of enteroendocrine factors (incretins). Despite the importance of energy homeostasis in the equine neonate, information on the EIA in hospitalized foals is lacking. The goals of this study were to measure serum insulin and plasma incretin (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide [GIP], glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] and glucagon-like peptide-2 [GLP-2]) concentrations, to determine the insulin and incretin association, as well as their link to disease severity and outcome in hospitalized foals. A total of 102 newborn foals ≤72 h old were classified into hospitalized (n = 88) and healthy groups (n = 14). Hospitalized foals included septic (n = 55) and sick non-septic (SNS; n = 33) foals based on sepsis scores. Blood samples were collected over 72 h to measure serum insulin and plasma GIP, GLP-1 and GLP-2 concentrations using immunoassays. Data were analyzed by nonparametric methods and univariate logistic regression. At admission, serum glucose and insulin and plasma GIP were significantly lower in hospitalized and septic compared to healthy foals (P < 0.01), while plasma GLP-1 and GLP-2 concentrations were higher in hospitalized and septic foals than healthy and SNS foals, and decreased over time in septic foals (P < 0.05). As a percent of admission values, GLP-1 and GLP-2 concentrations dropped faster in healthy compared to hospitalized foals. Serum insulin concentrations were lower in hospitalized and septic non-survivors  than survivors at admission (P < 0.01). Hospitalized foals with serum insulin < 5.8 µIU/mL, plasma GLP-1 >68.5 pM, and plasma GLP-2 >9 ng/mL within 24 h of admission were more likely to die (OR = 4.2; 95% CI = 1.1-16.1; OR = 13.5, 95% CI = 1.4-123.7; OR = 12.5, 95% CI = 1.6-97.6, respectively; P < 0.05). Low GIP together with increased GLP-1 and GLP-2 concentrations indicates that different mechanisms may be contributing to reduced insulin secretion in critically ill foals, including impaired intestinal production (GIP, proximal intestine) and pancreatic endocrine resistance to enhanced incretin secretion (GLP-1, GLP-2; distal intestine). These imbalances could contribute to energy dysregulation in the critically ill equine neonate.	0
34956173	Transcriptional and Histochemical Signatures of Bone Marrow Mononuclear Cell-Mediated Resolution of Synovitis.	Osteoarthritis (OA) may result from impaired ability of synovial macrophages to resolve joint inflammation. Increasing macrophage counts in inflamed joints through injection with bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMNC) induces lasting resolution of synovial inflammation. To uncover mechanisms by which BMNC may affect resolution, in this study, differential transcriptional signatures of BMNC in response to normal (SF) and inflamed synovial fluid (ISF) were analyzed. We demonstrate the temporal behavior of co-expressed gene networks associated with traits from related in vivo and in vitro studies. We also identified activated and inhibited signaling pathways and upstream regulators, further determining their protein expression in the synovium of inflamed joints treated with BMNC or  DPBS controls. BMNC responded to ISF with an early pro-inflammatory response characterized by a short spike in the expression of a NF-ƙB- and mitogen-related  gene network. This response was associated with sustained increased expression of two gene networks comprising known drivers of resolution (IL-10, IGF-1, PPARG, isoprenoid biosynthesis). These networks were common to SF and ISF, but more highly expressed in ISF. Most highly activated pathways in ISF included the mevalonate pathway and PPAR-γ signaling, with pro-resolving functional annotations that improve mitochondrial metabolism and deactivate NF-ƙB signaling. Lower expression of mevalonate kinase and phospho-PPARγ in synovium from inflamed joints treated with BMNC, and equivalent IL-1β staining between BMNC- and DPBS-treated joints, associates with accomplished resolution in BMNC-treated joints and emphasize the intricate balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms required for resolution. Combined, our data suggest that BMNC-mediated resolution is characterized by constitutively expressed homeostatic mechanisms, whose expression are enhanced following inflammatory stimulus. These mechanisms translate into macrophage proliferation optimizing their capacity to counteract inflammatory damage and improving their general and mitochondrial metabolism to endure oxidative stress while driving tissue repair. Such effect is largely achieved through the synthesis of several lipids that mediate recovery of homeostasis. Our study reveals candidate mechanisms by which BMNC provide lasting improvement in patients with OA and suggests further investigation on the effects of PPAR-γ signaling enhancement for the treatment of arthritic conditions.	0
34444372	Healthy Lifestyle and Academic Performance in Middle School Students from the Region of Aragón (Spain).	A healthy lifestyle is important to the present and future development and health of school age people. This study aims to analyze the relationship between daily lifestyle habits and academic performance in a sample of adolescents from the autonomous community of Aragon (Spain). We performed a cross-sectional study to analyze the lifestyle habits and academic performance of a total of 1745 7th and  8th grade middle school students during the academic year 2018-2019; the participants were selected from a random sample of 43 middle schools from the region of Aragon. The following data were collected through an anonymized, previously validated questionnaire: diet, sleep, physical activity, use of screens, use of toxic substances, and academic performance. We found a statistically significant association between all the lifestyle habits analyzed and academic performance (p < 0.001) in our sample. Based on our findings, we suggest that health promotion and education in healthy lifestyles should be integrated in middle school curricula to improve academic performance and, more importantly, to promote both present and future health outcomes of adolescents.	0
34565068	Management of antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndromes.	If atrial fibrillation (AF) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) coexist, they should be treated with combined antithrombotic therapy. To reduce the risk of bleeding while maintaining the desired antithrombotic effect, choices should be made for each patient according to the balance between the bleeding and the thrombotic risk. There are many ways to select the type and dose of the oral anticoagulant (OAC) and P2Y12 inhibitors. As a rule of thumb, aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitors should be recommended to all patients. The duration of this combination therapy is a matter of debate; available data promote an initial period of one to four weeks of triple antithrombotic association with aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitors (clopidogrel in the absence of high ischaemic risk) and preferable direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). On discontinuing aspirin, double therapy with P2Y12 inhibitors and a DOAC provides similar efficacy and superior safety for many patients on ACS medical or interventional treatment, especially if the risk of bleeding is high and that of thrombosis is low. Further studies are needed to clarify the concerns for a slight augmentation in the number of ischaemic cases (myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis) with double antithrombotic regimen in patients at high ischaemic risk.	0
35150300	Selection signatures for heat tolerance in Brazilian horse breeds.	Since domestication, horse breeds have adapted to their environments and differentiated from one another. This paper uses two methods to detect selection  signatures in 23 horse breeds, eight of which are Brazilian (610 animals), both cold-blooded and warm-blooded, from temperate and tropical regions. These animals were genotyped using the GGP Equine BeadChip and we analysed the data by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The samples were separated into groups based  on their geographical area of origin and PCA results studied. The genomic regions under selection were detected by hapFLK and PCAdapt methodologies, identifying six regions under selection with at least one Brazilian horse breed. These regions contain genes associated with heat tolerance, skin colour, body size, energy production/metabolism, genes involved in protein degradation/turnover/DNA  repair, genes reducing the impact of oxidative stress/cellular repair, and transcriptional regulation. This work confirmed LCORL and NCAPG gene regions in previous studies associated with body size on Equine Chromosome Autosome 3 (ECA3). On the same ECA3, a region implicating genes linked to coat colour was identified, also previously related to heat stress. Regions with genes coding heat shock proteins were found on ECA1 and 2, and many candidate genes for oxidation-reduction which are a natural response to heat stress. However, a larger sample size and whole-genome SNPs are needed to understand better and identify new candidate regions as well as their functional relation with heat tolerance.	0
35397022	Multivariate tools to investigate the spatial contaminant distribution in a highly anthropized area (Gulf of Naples, Italy).	The Gulf of Naples located in a high anthropized coastal area is subjected to an  infrastructural intervention for the installation of a submarine power pipeline.  In order to evaluate the distribution of contaminants in the seafloor sediments,  a preliminary study has been conducted in the area using multivariate techniques. The statistic approach was performed to gain insights on the occurrence of organic and inorganic contaminants within the area, aiming to identify the relevant hot spots. Three geographical sub-areas influenced by different contaminant association were recognized: Torre Annunziata (TA), Capri (CA), and middle offshore (MO). TA and CA resulted marked by a severe contamination pattern due to anthropogenic pressures. In addition, the influence of the depositional basin in governing the contamination trend has been pointed out. The supervised technique PLS_DA resulted to be a powerful tool in addressing the complexity of the huge dataset acquired during the marine survey, highlighting the main trends  in the variability of quality indicators, orienting thus the deeper investigations during follow-up monitoring activities.	0
35395048	West Nile and Usutu virus seroprevalence in Hungary: A nationwide serosurvey among blood donors in 2019.	In Hungary, West Nile virus (WNV) has been responsible for 459 laboratory confirmed human cases between 2004 and 2019, while the first human Usutu virus (USUV) infection was confirmed only in 2018. A comprehensive serosurvey was conducted among blood donors to assess the WNV and USUV seroprevalence in 2019, one year after the largest European WNV epidemic. Altogether, 3005 plasma samples were collected and screened for WNV and USUV specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). All reactive samples were further tested for tick-borne encephalitis virus IgG antibodies by ELISA. Indirect immunofluorescence test and microneutralization assay were used as confirmatory methods. Overall, the WNV seroprevalence was 4.32%, and in five blood donors USUV seropositivity was confirmed. The highest seroprevalence was measured in Central, Eastern and Southern Hungary, while the Western part of the  country proved to be less affected. There was a statistically strong association  between the WNV seroprevalence of 2019 and the cumulative incidence in the period of 2004 and 2019 calculated for every NUTS 3 region. The last WNV serological screening was performed in 2016 and the prevalence of anti-WNV IgG proved to be 2.19%. One year after the 2018 WNV outbreak, a significant increase in seroprevalence was observed in the Hungarian population and evidence for USUV seropositivity was also obtained. The spatial pattern of seroprevalence can support the identification of high-risk areas raising awareness of the need for increased surveillance, such as screening vector, equine, and avian populations.  The communication with general practitioners and other professionals in primary health care services can support the early identification of acute human cases. Education and awareness-raising on the importance of protection against mosquito  vectors amongst residents are also important parts of preventive measures.	0
35203823	The Prevalence and Molecular Biology of Staphylococcus aureus Isolated from Healthy and Diseased Equine Eyes in Egypt.	This work aimed to characterize S. aureus isolates from the eyes of healthy and clinically affected equines in the Kafrelsheikh Governorate, Egypt. A total of 110 animals were examined for the presence of S. aureus, which was isolated from  33 animals with ophthalmic lesions and 77 healthy animals. We also investigated the antimicrobial resistance profile, oxacillin resistance mechanism, and the major virulence factors implicated in many studies of the ocular pathology of pathogenic S. aureus. The association between S. aureus eye infections and potential risk factors was also investigated. The frequency of S. aureus isolates from clinically affected equine eyes was significantly higher than in clinically  healthy equids. A significant association was found between the frequency of S. aureus isolation from clinically affected equine eyes and risk factors including  age and season but not with sex or breed factors. Antimicrobial resistance to common antibiotics used to treat equine eyes was also tested. Overall, the isolates showed the highest sensitivity to sulfamethoxazole (100%) and the highest resistance to cephalosporin (90.67%) and oxacillin (90.48%). PCR was used to demonstrate that mecA was present in 100% of oxacillin- and β-lactam-resistant S. aureus strains. The virulence factor genes Spa (x region), nuc, and hlg were identified in 62.5%, 100%, and 56%, of isolates, respectively, from clinically affected equines eyes. The severity of the eye lesions increased in the presence  of γ-toxin-positive S. aureus. The phylogenetic tree of the Spa (x region) gene indicated a relationship with human reference strains isolated from Egypt as well as isolates from equines in Iran and Japan. This study provides insight into the  prevalence, potential risk factors, clinical pictures, zoonotic potential, antimicrobial resistance, and β-lactam resistance mechanism of S. aureus strains  that cause eye infection in equines from Egypt.	0
34634075	Development of ELISA based on Bacillus anthracis capsule biosynthesis protein CapA for naturally acquired antibodies against anthrax.	Anthrax is a zoonotic disease caused by the gram-positive spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Detecting naturally acquired antibodies against anthrax sublethal exposure in animals is essential for anthrax surveillance and effective control measures. Serological assays based on protective antigen (PA) of B. anthracis are mainly used for anthrax surveillance and vaccine evaluation. Although the assay is reliable, it is challenging to distinguish the naturally acquired antibodies from vaccine-induced immunity in animals because PA is cross-reactive to both antibodies. Although additional data on the vaccination history of animals could bypass this problem, such data are not readily accessible in many cases. In this study, we established a new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) specific to antibodies against capsule biosynthesis protein CapA antigen of B. anthracis, which is non-cross-reactive to vaccine-induced antibodies in horses. Using in silico analyses, we screened coding sequences encoded on pXO2 plasmid, which is absent in the veterinary vaccine strain Sterne 34F2 but present in virulent strains of B. anthracis. Among the 8 selected antigen candidates, capsule biosynthesis protein CapA (GBAA_RS28240) and peptide ABC transporter substrate-binding protein (GBAA_RS28340) were detected by antibodies in infected horse sera. Of these, CapA has not yet been identified as immunoreactive in other studies to the best of our knowledge. Considering the protein solubility and specificity of B. anthracis, we prepared the C-terminus region of CapA, named CapA322, and developed CapA322-ELISA based on a horse model. Comparative analysis of the CapA322-ELISA and PAD1-ELISA (ELISA uses domain one of the PA) showed that CapA322-ELISA could  detect anti-CapA antibodies in sera from infected horses but was non-reactive to  sera from vaccinated horses. The CapA322-ELISA could contribute to the anthrax surveillance in endemic areas, and two immunoreactive proteins identified in this study could be additives to the improvement of current or future vaccine development.	0
34444009	Sagittal Integral Morphotype of Competitive Amateur Athletes and Its Potential Relation with Recurrent Low Back Pain.	Athletes have higher thoracic and lumbar curvature in standing than the reference values of the non-athletic population. The sagittal integral morphotype method (SIM) assessment has not previously been applied to competitive amateur athletes  (CAA). The propose of the present study was to determine the SIM of CAA treated at a sports-medicine center and to identify spinal misalignments associated with  recurrent low back pain (LBP). An observational analysis was developed to describe the SIM in 94 CAA. The thoracic and lumbar curvatures of the CAA were measured in standing, sitting, and trunk forward flexion. Association analysis (Pearson's chi-square and Cramér's V tests) was then performed to identify the SIM misalignments associated with LBP. Effect size was analyzed based on Hedges'  g. The most common thoracic SIMs in CAA were total hyperkyphosis (male = 59.02%;  female = 42.42%) and static hyperkyphosis (male = 11.48%; female = 6.06%). Hyperlordotic attitude (female = 30.30%; male = 4.92%), static-functional hyperkyphosis (male = 16.39%; female = 3.03%), and structured hyperlordosis (female = 21.21%; male = 1.64%) were the most common lumbar SIMs. Hyperlordotic attitude, static functional lumbar hyperkyphosis, and structured hyperlordosis were associated with LBP in male and female athletes.	0
34679888	Comparison of American Quarter Horses Competing in Western Pleasure, Hunter under Saddle, and Reining Using Linear Traits.	To investigate differences in American Quarter Horses conformation suggesting specialization and subpopulations within the breed, a total of 45 horses were studied. These horses were classified according to their specific sport discipline: Western Pleasure (WPL, n = 15), Hunter under Saddle (HUS, n = 15), and Reining (RN, n = 15). Fifteen linear traits (comprising lengths, angles, and  circumferences) were measured analogically and photometrically. Afterwards, 9 ratios and differences were calculated, so that a total of 24 traits were examined. The results showed significant differences between horses depending on  their sport discipline. HUS horses were significant taller and were characterized by higher values in (nearly) all length traits; they were followed by WPL and RN  horses. RN horses displayed the lowest values in length traits but the largest difference between height at withers and height at croup. Nine parameters were analyzed through correlations to the height at withers; all differences were significant, with high to moderate correlation coefficients. The detected differences between the groups support recent studies on the conformation and genotype of subpopulations within a breed and reveal new findings in relation to  the selected disciplines. Image analysis worked well and provided reliable data;  therefore, this method can be used to examine horses in a time-efficient manner,  reducing the stress caused to the animal. Further studies are required to gain more information and to associate the features of AQH anatomic structures with successful performance.	0
35268211	Assessment of Skin and Mucosa at the Equine Oral Commissures to Assess Pathology  from Bit Wear: The Oral Commissure Assessment Protocol (OCA) for Analysis and Categorisation of Oral Commissures.	This study addresses the presence and location of natural pigmentation, potentially pathological changes in pigment, interruptions of the natural lining  (scars), roughness, and erosions/contusion (bruising) in and around the corners of the lips of 206 horses presented to a veterinarian for routine preventative dental treatment. After sedation, photographs were taken and later evaluated for  the presence of lesions. During the photographic analysis, the Oral Commissure Assessment (OCA) protocol was developed to map precisely the areas of skin and mucosa around the corners of the lips, and the presence of lesions was recorded for each area. Potentially pathological pigment changes occurred more frequently  in horses with a higher level of training (p = 0.04) and in light-coloured horses (p = 0.0004), but there was no association with the current use of a bit or the discipline that the horse participated in (p = 0.20). Scars occurred more frequently in horses competing at a higher level. Only two horses had contusions  or erosions, five had ulcers, and none showed bleeding; these numbers were too low for statistical analysis. Using the OCA protocol provides a detailed method for categorizing and recording lesions in and around the corners of the lips, including natural vs. potential and/or definite pathological character.	0
34906355	A single-nucleotide mutation within the TBX3 enhancer increased body size in Chinese horses.	Chinese ponies are endemic to the mountainous areas of southwestern China and were first reported in the archaeological record at the Royal Tomb of Zhongshan King, Mancheng, dated to approximately ∼2,100 YBP.1 Previous work has started uncovering the genetic basis of size variation in western ponies and horses, revealing a limited number of loci, including HMGA2,2LCORL/NCAPG,3ZFAT, and LASP1.4,5 Whether the same genetic pathways also drive the small body size of Chinese ponies, which show striking anatomical differences to Shetland ponies,6 remains unclear.2,7 To test this, we combined whole-genome sequences of 187 horses across China. Statistical analyses revealed top association between genetic variation at the T-box transcription factor 3 (TBX3) and the body size. Fine-scale analysis across an extended population of 189 ponies and 574 horses narrowed down the association to one A/G SNP at an enhancer region upstream of the TBX3 (ECA8:20,644,555, p = 2.34e-39). Luciferase assays confirmed the single-nucleotide G mutation upregulating TBX3 expression, and enhancer-knockout  mice exhibited shorter limbs than wild-type littermates (p < 0.01). Re-analysis of ancient DNA data showed that the G allele, which is most frequent in modern horses, first occurred some ∼2,300 years ago and rose in frequency since. This supports selection for larger size in Asia from approximately the beginning of the Chinese Empire. Overall, this study characterized the causal regulatory mutation underlying small body size in Chinese ponies and revealed size as one of the main selection targets of past Chinese breeders.	0
34441046	Association between Cone-Beam Computed Tomography and Histological and Immunohistochemical Features in Periapical Lesions Correlated with Thickened Maxillary Sinus Mucosa.	"Background and Objectives: Odontogenic sinusitis is a frequently underestimated pathology with fewer symptoms in patients with periapical lesions, periodontal disease, or iatrogenic foreign bodies in the maxillary sinus. The aim of our study was to determine the correlation between maxillary sinusitis and periapical lesions using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging and histological and immunohistochemical investigations. Materials and Methods: A total of 1450 initial patients diagnosed with maxillary sinusitis in the Ear-Nose-Throat (ENT)  Department, University of Medicine and Pharmacy ""Grigore T. Popa"" Iasi, Romania,  were treated with anti-inflammatory drugs. Of these, 629 still had unresolved symptomatology and were later referred to the Dental Medicine departments for further investigations. Only 50 subjects with periapical lesions in the premolar/molar maxillary area were included in the present study. All the periapical lesions were observed on CBCT and classified using the Periapical Status Index (PSI) and the mean maxillary sinus mucosa thicknesses (MSMT). The enrolled patients underwent surgical procedures with the excision of periapical lesions. The excised samples were submitted to the histological and immunohistochemical investigations. Results: The 50 patients presented periapical lesions of their maxillary teeth in 328 dental units. There was a higher prevalence of periapical lesions in men than in women (chi-square test). We observed a significant difference between the mean MSMT of individuals with periapical lesions compared to those without (p < 0.01). Mean MSMT was 1.23 mm for teeth without periapical lesions and 3.95 mm for teeth with periapical lesions. The histopathological study identified 50% cases with periapical granulomas, 10% cases with periapical granulomas with cystic potential, and 40% cases as periapical cysts. Immunohistochemical stainings showed that CD4+ helper  and CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, along with CD20+ B lymphocytes and CD68+ macrophages, were diffusely distributed in all periapical cysts and in some periapical granulomas, but CD79α+ plasma cells characterized especially periapical granulomas. Conclusions: The current study observed a significant correlation between CBCT maxillary mucosa thickness and type of periapical lesion. Chronic inflammatory lympho-histiocytic infiltrate predominates in periapical lesions, supporting the idea that lesion progression is determined by  a humoral-type (CD20+ and CD79α+ B lymphocytes) but also by a cellular-type (CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte population) immune mechanism."	0
34853345	Linking migratory performance to breeding phenology and productivity in an Afro-Palearctic long-distance migrant.	Understanding the relationship between migratory performance and fitness is crucial for predicting population dynamics of migratory species. In this study, we used geolocators to explore migration performance (speed and duration of migratory movements, migratory timings) and its association with breeding phenology and productivity in an Afro-Palearctic insectivore, the European bee-eater (Merops apiaster), breeding in Iberian Peninsula. Bee-eaters migrated at higher travel speeds and had shorter travel duration in spring compared to autumn. Individuals that departed earlier or spent fewer days in-flight arrived earlier to the breeding areas. Our results show overall positive, but year-specific, linkages between arrival and laying dates. In one year, laying was earlier and productivity was higher, remaining constant throughout the season, while in the subsequent year productivity was lower and, importantly, declined with laying date. These results suggest that arriving earlier can be advantageous for bee-eaters, as in years when breeding conditions are favourable, early and late breeders produce high and similar number of fledglings, but when conditions  are unfavourable only early breeders experience high productivity levels.	0
35004264	Equine Squamous Gastric Disease: Prevalence, Impact and Management.	This narrative review explores the etiopathogenesis, clinical signs, diagnosis and treatment of ESGD (equine squamous gastric disease) and discusses the impact  of this commonly encountered condition on the equine industry. ESGD refers specifically to peptic injury of the squamous mucosa of the stomach. Prevalence is highest in performance horses, but the disease has been documented across many breeds and ages, including in feral horses and foals. The pathogenesis of ESGD is well understood. Intensive management and exercise are important factors that contribute to a disruption of the normal stratification of gastric pH. This results in exposure of the vulnerable squamous mucosa to acid, leading to ulceration. Clinical signs are variable and there is little evidence to support a direct association between reported signs and the presence or absence of lesions  seen on gastroscopy. Management is aimed at acid suppression and mitigation of known risk factors.	0
35074400	Genome-Wide Association Analyses of Osteochondrosis in Belgian Warmbloods Reveal  Candidate Genes Associated With Chondrocyte Development.	Osteochondrosis (OC) is an important skeletal disease causing profound welfare concerns in horses. Although numerous studies have explored the genetics underlying OC in various breeds, the Belgian Warmblood (BW) remains unstudied despite having a concerning prevalence of 32.0%. As a result, this study aimed to conduct genome-wide association (GWA) analyses to identify candidate variants associated with OC in BWs. To achieve this, blood samples and radiographs were collected from 407 Belgian Warmbloods registered to one of two BW studbooks (Belgisch Warmbloedpaard and Zangersheide), and genotyping was performed using the 670K Axiom Equine Genotyping Array. GWA analyses using a principle component  approach were then performed on OC status (OCS; presence or absence of OC at any  joint), hock OC status (HOC) and stifle OC status (SOC). These analyses yielded significantly associated (P < .01) SNPs on Equus caballus chromosome (ECA) 3, ECA 12, and ECA 18 for OCS; however, no single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reached significance for HOC or SOC. Subsequent analysis of candidate genes within 500 kilobases of the significant SNPs revealed functions broadly related to cell differentiation and chondrocyte development. While this study represents  another step forward in uncovering variants and biological pathways associated with OC, additional studies are needed to validate the newly identified candidate SNPs for OC in BWs. Further studies of OC in BWs, as well as other breeds, are critical in our efforts to fully understand the disease's etiopathogenesis and ultimately provide breeding programs better equipped to improve horse health and  well-being.	0
34975171	Fragment size is associated with post-operative complications following elective  arthroscopy of the tibiotarsal joint of horses.	The objective of this retrospective study was to determine the occurrence of joint-related complications after elective arthroscopy of the tibiotarsal joint (TTJ) in 329 horses, and the association with specific clinical parameters. Data  were collected from medical records of horses undergoing elective tibiotarsal joint arthroscopy for fragment removal. Exact conditional univariate regression was used to determine significant risk factors for joint-related post-operative complications. Of 485 joints, 2 (0.4%) developed surgical site infection, 4 (0.8%) developed septic arthritis, 1 (0.2%) developed synovial fistula. There was a significantly increased odds of having septic arthritis as height and length of the distal intermediate ridge of the tibia (DIRT) lesion increased. The median height and length of the DIRT fragments in affected cases was 13.5 mm and 18.0 mm, respectively. For each unit (1 mm) increase in height, there was a 42% increase in the risk of septic arthritis occurrence (P = 0.0042), and a 15% increase for each unit increase in length (P = 0.035). Horses were significantly  less likely to develop septic arthritis when suture smaller than USP 0 was used.  Horses with larger osteochondritis dissecans lesions of the DIRT region have an increased risk of developing septic arthritis following fragment removal.	0
35197413	Effects of branched-chain amino acids on immune status of young racing horses.	High-intensity exercise and competition are associated with depressed immune function. Young horses, which participate in high-intensity exercise and competitions, are at increased risk for the development of infectious disease due to depression of immune function. The effects of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation on the immune status of young racing horses were evaluated, determining whether BCAA might help to avoid or reduce immune suppression during  exercise and competitions. Twenty horses (10 male and 10 female) were treated with BCAA supplementation; another twenty untreated horses (10 male and 10 female) constituted control group. Peripheral blood was collected from each animal and evaluated for lymphocyte subsets, phagocytosis analysis of monocytes and granulocytes, lymphocyte proliferative response, and expression of cytokine-encoding messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs). The numbers of CD4+, CD8+, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II+ cells in females of the treated group were significantly higher than those in females of the control group. The lymphocyte proliferative response in female of the treated group also  was significantly higher than that in females of the control group. In addition,  expression of mRNAs encoding interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in females of the treated group was significantly higher than that in females of the control group. There were no significant differences between males of the treated and control groups. The results of this study indicated the positive effects of BCAA supplementation in counteracting immunosuppression in young female racing horses during and following high-intensity exercise.	0
34671162	The origins and spread of domestic horses from the Western Eurasian steppes.	Domestication of horses fundamentally transformed long-range mobility and warfare1. However, modern domesticated breeds do not descend from the earliest domestic horse lineage associated with archaeological evidence of bridling, milking and corralling2-4 at Botai, Central Asia around 3500 BC3. Other longstanding candidate regions for horse domestication, such as Iberia5 and Anatolia6, have also recently been challenged. Thus, the genetic, geographic and  temporal origins of modern domestic horses have remained unknown. Here we pinpoint the Western Eurasian steppes, especially the lower Volga-Don region, as  the homeland of modern domestic horses. Furthermore, we map the population changes accompanying domestication from 273 ancient horse genomes. This reveals that modern domestic horses ultimately replaced almost all other local populations as they expanded rapidly across Eurasia from about 2000 BC, synchronously with equestrian material culture, including Sintashta spoke-wheeled chariots. We find that equestrianism involved strong selection for critical locomotor and behavioural adaptations at the GSDMC and ZFPM1 genes. Our results reject the commonly held association7 between horseback riding and the massive expansion of Yamnaya steppe pastoralists into Europe around 3000 BC8,9 driving the spread of Indo-European languages10. This contrasts with the scenario in Asia where Indo-Iranian languages, chariots and horses spread together, following the  early second millennium BC Sintashta culture11,12.	0
34749609	Microglia and its Genetics in Alzheimer's Disease.	Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia across the world. While its discovery and pathological manifestations are centered on protein aggregations of amyloid- beta (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau protein, neuroinflammation has emerged in the last decade as a main component of the disease in terms of both pathogenesis and progression. As the main innate immune  cell type in the central nervous system (CNS), microglia play a very important role in regulating neuroinflammation, which occurs commonly in neurodegenerative  conditions, including AD. Under inflammatory response, microglia undergo morphological changes and status transition from homeostatic to activated forms.  Different microglia subtypes displaying distinct genetic profiles have been identified in AD, and these signatures often link to AD risk genes identified from the genome-wide association studies (GWAS), such as APOE and TREM2. Furthermore, many AD risk genes are highly enriched in microglia and specifically influence the functions of microglia in pathogenesis, e.g. releasing inflammatory cytokines and clearing Aβ. Therefore, building up a landscape of these risk genes in microglia, based on current preclinical studies and in the context of their pathogenic or protective effects, would largely help us to understand the complex etiology of AD and provide new insight into the unmet need for effective treatment.	0
34670697	Risk Factors for Jockey Falls in Japanese Thoroughbred Flat Racing.	Jockey safety is of paramount importance from welfare perspective and public perception. This retrospective case-control study aims to identify risk factors associated with jockey falls (JF) in flat races of Japan Racing Association (JRA). JF in 715,210 race starts by 74,328 horses at 10 racecourses from 2003 to  2017 were reviewed. Data were extracted from a database maintained by JRA and from official accident reports issued by race stewards. Seventeen possible risk factors were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression, to identify those significantly associated with JF. A total of 992 JF incidents were recorded, with an incidence rate of 1.39 falls per 1,000 starts (95% CI: 1.30-1.48). 6 risk factors were significantly associated with JF. Odds increased with horses that sustained catastrophic musculoskeletal injury (CMI) (OR: 203; CI: 169-241; P < 0.001). Increased odds were also associated with dirt track surfaces (OR: 1.99; CI: 1.74-2.29; P < 0.001), apprentice jockeys (OR: 1.43; CI: 1.21-1.68; P < 0.001), smaller track sizes (OR: 1.41; CI: 1.24-1.61; P < 0.001), larger fields (OR: 1.25; CI: 1.07-1.47; P = 0.005), and longer race distances (OR per 200 m: 1.05; CI: 1.01-1.09; P = 0.02). Since CMI was identified as a major contributing  factor for JF, measures to minimize CMI may lead to improvement of jockey safety. The increased odds associated with apprentice jockeys may indicate the importance of jockey education and training. For jockey safety, proper staffing of medical professionals especially for races on dirt, smaller track, larger fields, and longer distances is recommended.	0
34979262	Levels of Serum Phosphorylated Neurofilament Heavy Subunit in Clinically Healthy  Standardbred Horses.	Neurofilaments heavy chain proteins (pNF-H) have been identified as useful serum  biomarkers for humans and animals with neurologic conditions, some of which can lead to poor performance, and athletic injuries. However, there are no published  reports that describe a reference range for serum pNF-H levels in healthy racehorses. This cross-sectional study was carried out to determine the serum concentration of pNF-H in 1,349 samples collected from 1,291 clinically healthy standardbred (SB) racehorses. Data on age, time of sampling (pre-race or post-race), and finishing position during a race were collected. The concentration of pNF-H in serum samples was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The appropriate statistical techniques were used to  determine the median serum concentration of pNF-H in these horses, if the serum concentration of pNF-H changed with age, if there were changes in the serum concentration of pNF-H during a race, and if there was an association between serum concentration of pNF-H, and the finishing position for the horse. The median serum concentration of pNF-H in this group of clinically healthy SB horses was 0.0 ng/mL. The concentration of pNF-H in serum was not associated with the age of the horses in this study as was determined by regression analysis. There was no significant change in the serum concentration of pNF-H before and after a  race in paired samples. There was no association of serum concentration of pNF-H  and the finishing position of the horses after the race. The data from this study supports use of <0.412 ng/mL as a reference interval for measurement of serum levels of pNF-H in SB racehorses as 95% of the collected samples fell into the range 0.0-0.412 ng/mL.	0
34689632	Detection of asinine gammaherpesviruses in association with pulmonary fibrosis in free-ranging donkeys.	A mortality event among recently captured feral donkeys (Equus asinus) occurred in south-central Utah in 2016. The deaths were sporadic, and clinical signs were  indicative of respiratory disease, likely associated with an infectious etiology. Ten of 13 donkeys autopsied had moderate-to-severe interstitial fibrosing pneumonia, and one had pyogranulomatous pneumonia. Consensus PCRs directed toward the DNA polymerase and DNA packaging terminase subunit 1 for herpesviruses were performed followed by sequencing of the PCR amplicons and phylogenetic analysis.  Asinine herpesvirus 4 (AsHV4) and 5 (AsHV5) were consistently identified in lung  tissues of affected donkeys. No other herpesviruses were identified, and herpesviral DNA was not detected in lung tissues of 2 donkeys without evidence of respiratory disease. The detection of asinine gammaherpesviruses may have been associated with the lesions described. AsHV4 and AsHV5 have been reported in previous studies as novel gammaherpesviruses based on sequences obtained from donkeys with interstitial pneumonia and marked syncytial cell formation. Our findings suggest that the association of asinine gammaherpesviruses with respiratory conditions in equids deserves further attention.	0
34583582	Photosynthesis from stolen chloroplasts can support sea slug reproductive fitness.	Some sea slugs are able to steal functional chloroplasts (kleptoplasts) from their algal food sources, but the role and relevance of photosynthesis to the animal host remain controversial. While some researchers claim that kleptoplasts  are slowly digestible 'snacks', others advocate that they enhance the overall fitness of sea slugs much more profoundly. Our analysis shows light-dependent incorporation of 13C and 15N in the albumen gland and gonadal follicles of the sea slug Elysia timida, representing translocation of photosynthates to kleptoplast-free reproductive organs. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids with reported roles in reproduction were produced in the sea slug cells using labelled precursors translocated from the kleptoplasts. Finally, we report reduced fecundity of E. timida by limiting kleptoplast photosynthesis. The present study  indicates that photosynthesis enhances the reproductive fitness of kleptoplast-bearing sea slugs, confirming the biological relevance of this remarkable association between a metazoan and an algal-derived organelle.	0
34730540	Changes in Self-Reported Web-Based Gambling Activity During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Study.	BACKGROUND: The COVID‑19 pandemic has affected not only somatic health with over  3.7 million deaths worldwide, but also has had a huge impact on psychological health, creating what amounts to a mental health crisis. The negative effect of the pandemic on traditional addictions is well described and concerning, and the  same has been seen for gambling. OBJECTIVE: This study explores self-reported web-based gambling behavior during the COVID‑19 pandemic in Sweden. We investigated overall changes, but also changes in specific web-based gambling types, and whether they are associated with certain risk factors or lifestyle changes. METHODS: Our study is based on an anonymous web-based survey of web panel participants in Sweden (N=1501) designed to study a range of behavioral changes during the COVID‑19 pandemic. Increases in gambling were analyzed using logistic  regression models against sociodemographic data and psychological distress. RESULTS: The majority of the respondents who gambled reported no changes in their gambling habits during the COVID‑19 pandemic. We found significant associations with the problem gambling severity index (PGSI), the Kessler score (indicating psychological distress), employment status, changes in alcohol habits, and self-exclusion when looking at overall changes in gambling activity in the pandemic. In the subgroup that reported an increase in gambling activity, we found an association with both the PGSI and Kessler scores. The PGSI score was also an independent predictor for all specific web-based gambling (horses, sports, poker, and casino) whereas the Kessler score only had a significant impact on changes in casino gambling. In addition, male gender was an independent predictor for gambling on sports and casino gambling. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of respondents who gambled reported no changes in their gambling activity during the COVID‑19 pandemic. The group that reported an increase in overall gambling activity during the COVID-19 pandemic represent a group with gambling problems and psychological distress. The group that reported  increased sports and casino gambling were often male, and this group seemed to experience more psychological distress.	0
34929445	The covalent complex of Jo-In results from a long-lived, non-covalent intermediate state with near-native structure.	Covalent protein complexes have been used to assemble enzymes in large scaffolds  for biotechnology purposes. Although the catalytic mechanism of the covalent linking of such proteins is well known, the recognition and overall structural mechanisms driving the association are far less understood but could help further functional engineering of these complexes. Here, we study the Jo-In complex by NMR spectroscopy and molecular modelling. We characterize a transient non-covalent complex, with structural elements close to those in the final covalent complex. Using site specific mutagenesis, we further show that this non-covalent association is essential for the covalent complex to form.	0
34911155	Hemodynamic, endocrine, and gene expression mechanisms regulating equine ovarian  follicular and cellular development.	Ovulatory follicle development and associated oocyte maturation involve complex coordinated molecular and cellular mechanisms not yet fully understood. This study addresses the relationships among follicle diameter, follicle wall blood flow, follicular-fluid factors, and gene expression for follicle growth, steroidogenesis, angiogenesis, and apoptosis in granulosa/cumulus cells and oocytes during different stages from the beginning of largest/ovulatory follicle  to impending ovulation in mares. The most remarkable findings were (i) a positive association between follicle development, follicle blood flow, intrafollicular follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, progesterone, and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression for FSHR and LHCGR in granulosa cells of the largest/ovulatory follicle; (ii) a plateau or decrease in follicle diameter and blood flow and granulosa cell mRNA for FSHR, LHCGR, IGF1R, VEGFR2, CYP19A1, and CASP3 at the preovulatory stage; (iii) higher StAR and BCL2 and lower CASP3 mRNA in granulosa cells at the time of impending ovulation; (iv) greater IGF1R mRNA for granulosa cells at the predeviation stage; and (v) lower FSHR, LHCGR, IGF1R, and VEGFR2 mRNA in cumulus cells and greater LHCGR and IGF1R  mRNA in oocytes at the ovulatory stage. This study is a critical advance in the understanding of molecular mechanisms of follicle development and oocyte maturation and is expected to be vital for future studies targeting potential markers.	0
35342743	Yamanaka Factors in the Budding Tunicate Botryllus schlosseri Show a Shared Spatio-Temporal Expression Pattern in Chordates.	In vertebrates, the four transcription factors Sox2, c-Myc, Pou5f1 and Klf4 are involved in the differentiation of several tissues during vertebrate embryogenesis; moreover, they are normally co-expressed in embryonic stem cells and play roles in pluripotency, self-renewal, and maintenance of the undifferentiated state in adult cells. The in vitro forced co-expression of these factors, named Yamanaka factors (YFs), induces pluripotency in human or mouse fibroblasts. Botryllus schlosseri is a colonial tunicate undergoing continuous stem cell-mediated asexual development, providing a valuable model system for the study of pluripotency in the closest living relatives of vertebrates. In this study, we identified B. schlosseri orthologs of human Sox2 and c-Myc genes, as well as the closest homologs of the vertebrate-specific Pou5f1 gene, through an in-depth evolutionary analysis of the YF gene families in tunicates and other deuterostomes. Then, we studied the expression of these genes during the asexual  cycle of B. schlosseri using in situ hybridization in order to investigate their  possible involvement in tissue differentiation and in pluripotency maintenance. Our results show a shared spatio-temporal expression pattern consistent with the  reported functions of these genes in invertebrate and vertebrate embryogenesis. Moreover, Myc, SoxB1 and Pou3 were expressed in candidate stem cells residing in  their niches, while Pou2 was found expressed exclusively in the immature previtellogenic oocytes, both in gonads and circulating in the colonial vascular  system. Our data suggest that Myc, SoxB1 and Pou3 may be individually involved in the differentiation of the same territories seen in other chordates, and that, together, they may play a role in stemness even in this colonial ascidian.	0
35055768	Prevalence and Characteristics of Back Pain in Children and Adolescents from the  Region of Murcia (Spain): ISQUIOS Programme.	Puberty is a vulnerable period for musculoskeletal disorders due to the existence of a wide inter-individual variation in growth and development. The main objective of the present study was to describe the prevalence of back pain (BP) in the past year and month in school-aged children according to sex, age, maturity status, body mass index (BMI) and pain characteristics. This study involved 513 students aged between 9 and 16 years. Anthropometric measures were recorded to calculate the maturity stage of the students using a regression equation comprising measures for age, body mass, body height, sitting height and  leg length. An ad hoc questionnaire composed of eight questions was used to describe BP prevalence in school-aged children. The results showed that the prevalence of BP in school-aged children was observed in 35.1% over the last year (45% boys and 55% girls), and 17.3% (40.4% boys and 59.6% girls, with an association found between female sex and BP) in the last month. The prevalence of back pain in the past year and month was higher the older the students were, or the more pubertal development they had experienced. The prevalence of BP in the last year was also higher in those with overweight or obesity. After adjustment for sex, there was an association between BP and older age and higher BMI in boys and an association between BP and higher pubertal development in girls. In summary, the present study showed that the prevalence of BP was related to the maturity stage and weight of the participants, with different prevalence patterns found according to sex.	0
34694482	Placentation in the African Elephant (Loxodonta africana).	"The female elephant shows a 3-week ""follicular phase"" to commence her 16-week estrous cycle at the end of which a second surge in pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) release matures and ovulates an ovarian follicle in association with estrous behavior and mating, whereas the first LH surge at the start of the follicular phase causes luteinization of 3-5 partially developed follicles. The prolonged pregnancy of 22 months is supported by a zonary endotheliochorial placenta which  secretes placental lactogen (ePL) from around 40 days of gestation in association with replacement of the lumenal epithelium of the endometrium by trophoblast and  the development of large corpora lutea (CLs) in the maternal ovaries from the previously formed luteinized follicles in response to the first LH peak early in  the follicular phase. The zonary placenta develops above, rather than within, the endometrium. The elephant placenta secretes neither estrogens nor progestagens throughout gestation, as pregnancy maintenance relies on 5α-dihyroprogesterone and other 5α reduced progestagens secreted by secondary CLs stimulated by ePL and the stromal tissue of the fetal gonads, which become extremely enlarged during the second half of the 22-month pregnancy. In female fetuses, this ovarian enlargement includes the development and subsequent regression of multiple primary and secondary follicles with a consequent substantial decline in primary  follicle numbers at birth. During the next 8-9 years of pre-pubertal life, however, oocyte and primary follicle numbers recover to levels near those found in late gestation, which may be evidence of postnatal oogenesis occurring in the  elephant."	0
34827862	Association of Thoroughbred Racehorse Workloads and Rest Practices with Trainer Success.	Understanding the relationship between the training practices of Thoroughbred racehorses and race performance is important to ensure advice given to trainers for injury prevention or management is practical and consistent. We assessed associations between intended volume and speed of gallop training (i.e., typical  workloads for horses free of injury or other performance limiting conditions) and rest practices on official trainer career and previous season success rates (rate of wins and places, prizemoney per start). Sixty-six Australian Thoroughbred trainers were surveyed. Multivariable negative binomial regression models were employed for the outcomes career and previous season wins and places, and linear  regression models for prizemoney per start. Intended training workload was not associated with prizemoney. Pre-trial total galloping distances (≥13.3 m/s) between 7500 m and 15,000 m were associated with a higher rate of career wins, and previous season wins and places per start (p < 0.05). Slow-speed (13.3-14.3 m/s) galloping distance to trial between 5000 m to 12,500 m was associated with higher rate of career placings per start, with reduced performance over 12,500 m  (p = 0.003). Greater time between race starts was associated with a greater rate  of previous season wins and prizemoney per start until three weeks between starts, with decline in performance thereafter (p < 0.05). Greater frequency of rest breaks was associated with greater prizemoney per start earnt in the previous season (p ≤ 0.01). These results suggest that modifications to training  programs aimed at injury prevention, such as avoiding long galloping distances, should not adversely affect trainer success.	0
34696794	Equine vitiligo-like depigmentation in grey horses is related to genes involved in immune response and tumor metastasis.	BACKGROUND: In horses, the autoimmune disease vitiligo is characterized by the loss of melanocytes and results in patchy depigmentation of the skin around the eyes, muzzle and the perianal region. Vitiligo-like depigmentation occurs predominantly in horses displaying the grey coat colour and is observed at a prevalence level of 26.0-67.0% in grey horses compared with only 0.8-3.5% in non-grey horses. While the polygenetic background of this complex disease is well documented in humans, the underlying candidate genes for this skin disorder in horses remain unknown. In this study we aim to perform a genome-wide association  study (GWAS) for identifying putative candidate loci for vitiligo-like depigmentation in horses. METHODS: In the current study, we performed a GWAS analysis using high-density 670 k single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from 152 Lipizzan and 104 Noriker horses, which were phenotyped for vitiligo-like depigmentation by visual inspection. After quality control 376,219 SNPs remained for analyses, the genome-wide Bonferroni corrected significance level was p < 1.33e-7. RESULTS: We identified seven candidate genes on four chromosomes (ECA1, ECA13, ECA17, ECA20) putatively involved in vitiligo pathogenesis in grey horses. The highlighted genes PHF11, SETDB2, CARHSP1 and LITAFD, are associated with the innate immune system, while the genes RCBTB1, LITAFD, NUBPL, PTP4A1, play a role  in tumor suppression and metastasis. The antagonistic pathogenesis of vitiligo in relation to cancer specific enhanced cell motility and/or metastasis on typical melanoma predilection sites underlines a plausible involvement of RCBTB1, LITAFD, NUBPL, and PTP4A1. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed candidate genes for equine vitiligo-like depigmentation, indicate an antagonistic relation between vitiligo and tumor metastasis in a horse population with higher incidence of melanoma. Further replication and expression studies should lead to a better understanding of this  skin disorder in horses.	0
34670698	Influence of Stretching Exercises, Warm-Up, or Cool-Down on the Physical Performance of Mangalarga Marchador Horses.	The Horse Agribusiness Complex is an important activity in the Brazilian agricultural sector. Mangalarga Marchador (MM) is the most numerous breed of horses in Brazil and its temperament and gait characteristics (4-beat stepping gait) allow for the constant growth of the breed and the performance of vs. equestrian activities. The training management currently adopted with MM horses is based on empiricism, and scientific support is necessary to improve the well-being of horses in competitions and maintain the physical integrity of these athletes. Therefore, this study aimed to verify the effects of stretching, warming up, and/or cooling down on their performance in marcha tests. 6 MM geldings (aged between 3 and 7 years and average weight of 400 kg) were used. The pre-experimental stage for the physical conditioning of the horses lasted 46 days. The experimental phase lasted 42 days and consisted of 6 marcha tests performed every 7 days. The experimental design was in a Latin square (6 × 6), in which each horse was submitted to the following exercise protocols: A) 50-min marcha test following the official regulations of the Brazilian Association of Horse Breeders Mangalarga Marchador (ABCCMM); B) 10 min of warm-up before marcha  test; C) 10 min of cooling after marcha test; D) 10 min of warm-up before marcha  and 10 min of cool-down after marcha test; E) 10 min of stretching before the marcha test; F) 10 min of stretching, 10 min of warm-up before and 10 min of cool-down after the test. Horses were evaluated before and after marcha tests for heart rate (HR), respiratory rate, rectal temperature, glucose, lactate, creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase and cortisol. Data were submitted to 2-way analysis of variance (exercise protocols and evaluation moments) and means were compared by Tukey's test (P≤0.05). The HR and blood lactate results indicated a beneficial effect of warm-up or stretching practices on the performance of Mangalarga Marchador horses submitted to simulated marcha tests in accordance with the official ABCCMM regulation and lasting 50 minutes.	0
34456647	ANMCO POSITION PAPER: Role of intra-aortic balloon pump in patients with acute advanced heart failure and cardiogenic shock.	The treatment of patients with advanced acute heart failure is still challenging. Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) has widely been used in the management of patients with cardiogenic shock. However, according to international guidelines,  its routinary use in patients with cardiogenic shock is not recommended. This recommendation is derived from the results of the IABP-SHOCK II trial, which demonstrated that IABP does not reduce all-cause mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock. The present position paper, released by the Italian Association of Hospital Cardiologists, reviews the available data  derived from clinical studies. It also provides practical recommendations for the optimal use of IABP in the treatment of cardiogenic shock and advanced acute heart failure.	0
34680875	MYO5A Frameshift Variant in a Miniature Dachshund with Coat Color Dilution and Neurological Defects Resembling Human Griscelli Syndrome Type 1.	A 1-month-old, female, smooth-haired miniature Dachshund with dilute color and neurological defects was investigated. The aim of this study was to characterize  the clinical signs, histopathological changes and underlying genetic defect. The  puppy had visible coat color dilution and was unable to hold its head on its own  or to remain in a stable prone position for an extended period. Histopathological examination revealed an accumulation of clumped melanin and deposition of accumulated keratin within the hair follicles, accompanied by dermal pigmentary incontinence. These dermatological changes were compatible with the histopathology described in dogs with an MLPH-related dilute coat color. We sequenced the genome of the affected dog and compared the data to 795 control genomes. MYO5A, coding for myosin VA, was investigated as the top functional candidate gene. This search revealed a private homozygous frameshift variant in MYO5A, XM_022412522.1:c.4973_4974insA, predicted to truncate 269 amino acids (13.8%) of the wild type myosin VA protein, XP_022268230.1:p.(Asn1658Lysfs*28). The genotypes of the index family showed the expected co-segregation with the phenotype and the mutant allele was absent from 142 additionally genotyped, unrelated Dachshund dogs. MYO5A loss of function variants cause Griscelli type 1  syndrome in humans, lavender foal in horses and the phenotype of the dilute mouse mutant. Based on the available data, together with current knowledge on other species, we propose the identified MYO5A frameshift insertion as a candidate causative variant for the observed dermatological and neurological signs in the investigated dog.	0
34573515	Data Collection for the Fourth Multicentre Confidential Enquiry into Perioperative Equine Fatalities (CEPEF4) Study: New Technology and Preliminary Results.	"It is almost 20 years since the largest observational, multicentre study evaluating the risks of mortality associated with general anaesthesia in horses.  We proposed an internet-based method to collect data (cleaned and analysed with R) in a multicentre, cohort, observational, analytical, longitudinal and prospective study to evaluate peri-operative equine mortality. The objective was  to report the usefulness of the method, illustrated with the preliminary data, including outcomes for horses seven days after undergoing general anaesthesia and certain procedures using standing sedation. Within six months, data from 6701 procedures under general anaesthesia and 1955 standing sedations from 69 centres  were collected. The results showed (i) the utility of the method; also, that (ii) the overall mortality rate for general anaesthesia within the seven-day outcome period was 1.0%. In horses undergoing procedures other than exploratory laparotomy for colic (""noncolics""), the rate was lower, 0.6%, and in ""colics"" it  was higher, at 3.4%. For standing sedations, the overall mortality rate was 0.2%. Finally, (iii) we present some descriptive data that demonstrate new developments since the previous CEPEF2. In conclusion, horses clearly still die unexpectedly when undergoing procedures under general anaesthesia or standing sedation. Our method is suitable for case collection for future studies."	0
34783081	Nasopharyngeal bacterial and fungal microbiota in normal horses and horses with nasopharyngeal cicatrix syndrome.	BACKGROUND: The nasopharyngeal bacterial and fungal microbiota of normal horses and those with nasopharyngeal cicatrix syndrome (NCS) are unknown. HYPOTHESES/OBJECTIVES: To describe the microbiota from nasopharyngeal washes of healthy horses and of horses acutely affected with NCS. ANIMALS: Twenty-six horses acutely affected with NCS horses and 14 unaffected horses. METHODS: Prospective, observational cohort study. Horses were recruited by investigators through personal communications in central Texas. Bacterial (16s RNA) and fungal (internal transcribed spacer) microbiota from nasopharyngeal washes were evaluated. Polymerase chain reaction for detection of Pythium insidiosum was performed. RESULTS: Results indicated that 6 fungal genera (Alternaria, Bipolaris, Microascus, Spegazzinia, Paraconiothyrium, Claviceps) and 1 bacterial genera (Staphylococcus) were significantly different between affected and unaffected horses. The fungal genus Bipolaris had increased abundance in NCS affected horses and on NCS affected farms. Pythium insidiosum was absent in the nasopharyngeal wash of all horses, irrespective of health status. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Significant differences were identified in the fungal microbiota in horses affected with NCS and farms affected with NCS compared to those unaffected. Therefore, Bipolaris warrants further investigation.	0
34893433	Retrospective study of the prevalence of factors contributing to successful standing at first attempt in horses recovering from general anesthesia.	OBJECTIVE: Several factors affect the quality of recovery from general anesthesia in horses. These can increase the likelihood of injury. Body and limb position during recovery may correlate with successful standing. The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of and the factors associated with successful standing at the first attempt in horses undergoing general anesthesia. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. METHODS: Video of recovery and anesthetic records from 221 equine patients were reviewed by six veterinary students. Cases with poor video quality or incomplete  anesthetic records were excluded. Demographic variables, type of procedure, perioperative drugs administered, assistance during recovery and body and limb positions during the first attempt to stand were recorded. Association between putative variables (including specific descriptors for body and limb position) and success for standing were analyzed using backward logistic regression; significance was set at 0.05. A decision tree for a successful attempt was created to predict the outcome of a recovery attempt based on these variables. RESULTS: Extension of the carpal joints, head and neck alignment with the thoracic limbs, greater time in lateral recumbency, coordination during sternal recumbency, longer time to first attempt to stand and pelvic limb position were associated with successful standing at the first attempt. The association between extension of the carpal joints with wide base positioning of the pelvic limbs provided the best success rate for standing, whereas the association of flexed carpal joints and head and neck orientation different from the thoracic limbs resulted in a worse success rate. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that certain limb and body positions displayed by horses during recovery may be associated with the likelihood of successful standing at the first attempt. These variables may be useful for assessing recovery quality in future research.	0
34946810	Transcriptome Analysis of Neuroendocrine Regulation of Ovine Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Ovary Axis during Ovine Anestrus and the Breeding Season.	Most sheep are seasonal estrus, and they breed in autumn when the days get shorter. Seasonal estrus is an important factor that affects the productivity and fertility of sheep. The key point to solve this problem is to explore the regulation mechanism of estrus in sheep. Therefore, in this study, transcriptomic sequencing technology was used to identify differentially expressed mRNAs in the  hypothalamus, pituitary and ovary of Small Tail Han sheep (year-round estrus) and tan sheep (seasonal estrus) among luteal, proestrus and estrus stages. There were 256,923,304,156 mRNAs being identified in the hypothalamus, pituitary and ovary,  respectively. Functional analysis showed that the photosensor, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis pathways were enriched significantly. It is speculated that photoperiod may initiate estrus by stimulating the corresponding pathways in hypothalamus. ODC1, PRLH, CRYBB2, SMAD5, OPN1SW, TPH1 are believed to be key genes involved in the estrogen process. In conclusion, this study expanded the database of indigenous sheep breeds, and also provided new candidate genes for future genetic and molecular studies on the seasonal estrus trait in sheep.	0
34938314	Identification and Characterization of Circular RNAs in Association With the Deposition of Intramuscular Fat in Aohan Fine-Wool Sheep.	Aohan fine-wool sheep (AFWS) is a high-quality fine-wool sheep breed that supplies wool and meat. Research is needed on the molecular mechanism behind intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition that greatly improves mutton quality. The widely expressed non-coding RNA is physiologically used in roles such as competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) that includes circular RNAs (circRNAs). Although circRNAs were studied in many fields, little research was devoted to IMF in sheep. We used the longissimus dorsi muscle of 2 and 12-month-old AWFS as research material to identify circRNAs related to IMF deposition in these sheep by RNA-seq screening for differentially expressed circRNAs in the two age groups. A total of 11,565 candidate circRNAs were identified, of which the 104 differentially expressed circRNAs in the two age groups were analyzed. Enrichment analysis was performed using Gene Ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. The enriched pathways included lipid transport (GO:0006869), negative regulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway (GO:0090090), fat digestion and absorption (ko04975), and sphingolipid metabolism (ko00600). The differentially expressed circRNAs included ciRNA455, circRNA9086, circRNA7445, circRNA4557, and others. The source genes involved in these pathways might regulate IMF deposition. We used the TargetScan and miRanda software for interaction analysis, and a network diagram of circRNA-miRNA interactions was created. CircRNA455-miR-127, circRNA455-miR-29a, circRNA455-miR-103, circRNA4557-mir149-5p, and circRNA2440-mir-23a might be involved in the IMF deposition process. The targeting relationship of circRNA4557-miR-149-5p was verified by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. The RT-qPCR results of seven randomly selected circRNAs were consistent with the sequencing results. This study provides additional information on circRNA regulation of IMF deposition in  AFWS and is a useful resource for future research on this sheep breed.	0
34875538	Novel InDel variations of the Cry2 gene are associated with litter size in Australian White sheep.	Cryptochrome 2 (Cry2) gene regulates circadian rhythm and affects reproduction and pregnancy. Therefore, this study aimed to explore polymorphisms of the Cry2 gene and their associations with litter size at different parity in Australian White (AuW) ewes. Five putative insertion or deletion mutations within the Cry2 gene were selected to study their association with litter size. Two novel deletion mutations were identified in intronic region of Cry2 gene and were genotyped by agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing. The polymorphism information content (PIC) indicated that both mutations were low polymorphism in  tested groups. Statistical analysis revealed that the P1-Del-6-bp was significantly correlated with litter size at third parity (P = 0.010), in which individuals with insertion/deletion (ID) genotype had larger litter size than insertion/insertion (II) genotype (P < 0.05). Whereas, the P2-Del-6-bp was significantly correlated with litter size at first parity (P = 0.036), in which individuals with insertion/insertion (II) genotype had larger litter size than insertion/deletion (ID) genotype (P < 0.05). Collectively, these findings may provide new insights to expedite molecular breeding in sheep through marker-assisted selection strategies (MAS).	0
34586400	The potential for mitigation of methane emissions in ruminants through the application of metagenomics, metabolomics, and other -OMICS technologies.	"Ruminant supply chains contribute 5.7 gigatons of CO2-eq per annum, which represents approximately 80% of the livestock sector emissions. One of the largest sources of emission in the ruminant sector is methane (CH4), accounting for approximately 40% of the sectors total emissions. With climate change being a growing concern, emphasis is being put on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including those from ruminant production. Various genetic and environmental factors influence cattle CH4 production, such as breed, genetic makeup, diet, management practices, and physiological status of the host. The influence of genetic variability on CH4 yield in ruminants indicates that genomic selection for reduced CH4 emissions is possible. Although the microbiology of CH4 production has been studied, further research is needed to identify key differences in the host and microbiome genomes and how they interact with one another. The advancement of ""-omics"" technologies, such as metabolomics and metagenomics, may provide valuable information in this regard. Improved understanding of genetic mechanisms associated with CH4 production and the interaction between the microbiome profile and host genetics will increase the rate of genetic progress for reduced CH4 emissions. Through a systems biology approach, various ""-omics"" technologies can be combined to unravel genomic regions and genetic markers associated with CH4 production, which can then be used in selective breeding programs. This comprehensive review discusses current  challenges in applying genomic selection for reduced CH4 emissions, and the potential for ""-omics"" technologies, especially metabolomics and metagenomics, to minimize such challenges. The integration and evaluation of different levels of biological information using a systems biology approach is also discussed, which  can assist in understanding the underlying genetic mechanisms and biology of CH4  production traits in ruminants and aid in reducing agriculture's overall environmental footprint."	0
35330795	Role of Renal Sympathetic Nerve Activity in Volatile Anesthesia's Effect on Renal Excretory Function.	Regulation of fluid balance is pivotal during surgery and anesthesia and affects  patient morbidity, mortality, and hospital length of stay. Retention of sodium and water is known to occur during surgery but the mechanisms are poorly defined. In this study, we explore how the volatile anesthetic sevoflurane influences renal function by affecting renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA). Our results  demonstrate that sevoflurane induces renal sodium and water retention during pediatric anesthesia in association with elevated plasma concentration of renin but not arginine-vasopressin. The mechanisms are further explored in conscious and anesthetized ewes where we show that RSNA is increased by sevoflurane compared with when conscious. This is accompanied by renal sodium and water retention and decreased renal blood flow (RBF). Finally, we demonstrate that renal denervation normalizes renal excretory function and improves RBF during sevoflurane anesthesia in sheep. Taken together, this study describes a novel role of the renal sympathetic nerves in regulating renal function and blood flow  during sevoflurane anesthesia.	0
35358654	Expression features of the ovine FTO gene and association between FTO polymorphism and tail fat deposition related-traits in Hu sheep.	Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene is a famous dominant predictor of obesity, and plays pivotal roles in the regulating fatty acid transport and fat metabolism. In the current study, the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), DNA-pooled sequencing and KAspar assay were performed to detect the expression features of FTO and the polymorphisms of FTO associated with the tail fat weight  related-traits of Hu sheep. The results indicated that the expression of FTO gene is widely expressed in the tissues tested, and the expression level of FTO in tail fat tissue was evidently higher compared with that in the other tissues. In  addition, FTO showed the highest expression level in tail fat tissue at three months. The expression of FTO mRNA was lower in the large-tail fat group compared with that in the small-tail fat group in 6 months old. Subsequently, the polymorphism loci g. 23704451C > A detected in the FTO gene was confirmed to be significantly related to the tail length and the weight of tail fat. These results suggested that the polymorphism might be regarded as novel molecular marker for the breeding of small tail sheep.	0
34657583	Weather, Workload and Money: Determining and Evaluating Sources of Stress for Farmers in Ireland.	"The demands of modern farming can place substantial stress upon the farmer, adversely impacting their wellbeing. This study identifies both the prevalence of stress and assesses the demographic, farm, and social characteristics that impact the incidence of stress. We report the results of a survey of a nationally representative sample of farm enterprises in Ireland undertaken in association with the Teagasc National Farm Survey (NFS) in 2018, which saw 736 questionnaires completed by farm operators. Frequency analysis is used to report the primary sources and prevalence of stress. A probit model is developed identifying and quantifying the factors that impact the incidence of stress. There were 57% of farmers who reported experiencing stress resulting from their farm work. Key sources of stress included ""poor weather"", (47%), ""workload"" (32%) and ""financial"" concerns (28%). The results of the probit model establish that the effect of age on the incidence of stress is significant, positive, and non-linear, indicating as farmers get older they are more likely to experience stress but at a declining rate. Operating a sheep farm system, as opposed to any  other type of farm system, reduces the probability of stress. Working off-farm also reduces the probability of stress by 0.097, other things being equal. The findings highlight variance in the levels of stress reported by farmers by age and farm system, and consequently, the need to develop targeted supports that take consideration of differences within the population of farmers and farm enterprises."	0
35399048	Identification and characterization of circular RNAs in association with the feed efficiency in Hu lambs.	BACKGROUND: Circular RNA (circRNA), as a new members of noncoding RNA family, have vital functions in many biological processes by as microRNA sponges or competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). However, little has been reported about the genetic mechanism of circRNAs regulation of feed efficiency in sheep. RESULTS: This study aimed to explore the expression of circRNAs in the liver of Hu sheep with High-RFI (High residual feed intake) and Low-RFI (Low residual feed intake) using transcriptome sequencing. A total of 20,729 circRNAs were identified in two groups, in which 219 circRNAs were found as significantly differentially expressed. Several circRNAs were validated by using RT-PCR, sanger sequencing and RT-qPCR methods. These results demonstrated that the RNA-seq result and expression level of circRNAs identified are reliable. Subsequently, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of the parental genes of the differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs were mainly involved in immunity response and metabolic process. Finally, the ceRNA regulatory networks analysis showed that the target binding sites for miRNA such as novel_41, novel_115, novel_171 and oar-miR-485-3p in the identified DE cirRNAs. Importantly, two metabolic (SHISA3 and PLEKHH2) and four (RTP4, CD274, OAS1, and RFC3) immune-related target mRNAs were identified from 4 miRNAs. Association analysis showed that the polymorphism (RTP4 c.399 A > G) in the target gene RTP4 were significantly associated with RFI (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of sequencing data showed some candidate ceRNAs that may play key roles in the feed efficiency in sheep by regulating animal immune and metabolic. These results provide the basis data for further study of the biological functions of circRNAs in regulating sheep feed efficiency.	0
34438665	Novel Genes Associated with Dairy Traits in Sarda Sheep.	The aim of the present research was to analyze the variability of 45 SNPs from different genes involved in metabolism and innate immunity to perform an association analysis with the milk yield, composition and milk coagulation traits. A population of 1112 Sarda breed sheep was sampled. Genotyping was generated by a TaqMan Open ArrayTM. Thirty out of the 45 SNPs were polymorphic, and 12 displayed a minor allele frequency higher than 0.05. An association analysis showed that the variability at genes PRKAG3 and CD14 was significantly associated with the daily milk yield. The variability at PRKAG3 was also associated with the protein and casein content, somatic cell score and bacterial  score. The variation at the PRKAA2 gene was associated with the milk lactose concentration. The SNPs at CD14 were also associated with the traditional milk coagulation properties, while the SNPs at GHR and GHRHR were associated with kSR, a derived coagulation parameter related to the rate of syneresis. The information provided here is new and increases our knowledge of genotype-phenotype interactions in sheep. Our findings might be useful in appropriate breeding schemes to be set up for the Sarda sheep breed, but these should be confirmed by  further studies, possibly performed on independent populations.	0
35172716	Unfavorable genetic correlations between fecal egg count and milk production traits in the French blond-faced Manech dairy sheep breed.	BACKGROUND: Genetic selection has proven to be a successful strategy for the sustainable control of gastrointestinal parasitism in sheep. However, little is known on the relationship between resistance to parasites and production traits in dairy breeds. In this study, we estimated the heritabilities and genetic correlations for resistance to parasites and milk production traits in the blond-faced Manech breed. The resistance to parasites of 951 rams from the selection scheme was measured through fecal egg counts (FEC) at 30 days post-infection under experimental conditions. Six milk production traits [milk yield (MY), fat yield (FY), protein yield (PY), fat content (FC), protein content (PC) and somatic cell score (LSCS)], were used in this study and were collected on 140,127 dairy ewes in first lactation, as part of the official milk recording. These ewes were related to the 951 rams (65% of the ewes were daughters of the rams). RESULTS: Fecal egg counts at the end of the first and second infections were moderately heritable (0.19 and 0.37, respectively) and highly correlated (0.93).  Heritabilities were moderate for milk yields (ranging from 0.24 to 0.29 for MY, FY and PY) and high for FC (0.35) and PC (0.48). MY was negatively correlated with FC and PC (- 0.39 and - 0.45, respectively). FEC at the end of the second infection were positively correlated with MY, FY and PY (0.28, 0.29 and 0.24, respectively with standard errors of ~ 0.10). These slightly unfavorable correlations indicate that the animals with a high production potential are genetically more susceptible to gastrointestinal parasite infections. A low negative correlation (- 0.17) was also found between FEC after the second infection and LSCS, which suggests that there is a small genetic antagonism between resistance to gastrointestinal parasites and resistance to mastitis, which is another important health trait in dairy sheep. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate an unfavorable but low genetic relationship between resistance to gastrointestinal parasites and milk production traits in the blond-faced Manech breed. These results will help the breeders' association make decisions about how to include resistance to parasites in the selection objective.	0
35348608	Exploring human factors in the operating room: scoping review of training offerings for healthcare professionals.	BACKGROUND: Human factors (HF) integration can improve patient safety in the operating room (OR), but the depth of current knowledge remains unknown. This study aimed to explore the content of HF training for the operative environment. METHODS: We searched six bibliographic databases for studies describing HF interventions for the OR. Skills taught were classified using the Chartered Institute of Ergonomics and Human Factors (CIEHF) framework, consisting of 67 knowledge areas belonging to five categories: psychology; people and systems; methods and tools; anatomy and physiology; and work environment. RESULTS: Of 1851 results, 28 studies were included, representing 27 unique interventions. HF training was mostly delivered to interdisciplinary groups (n =  19; 70 per cent) of surgeons (n = 16; 59 per cent), nurses (n = 15; 56 per cent), and postgraduate surgical trainees (n = 11; 41 per cent). Interactive methods (multimedia, simulation) were used for teaching in all studies. Of the CIEHF knowledge areas, all 27 interventions taught 'behaviours and attitudes' (psychology) and 'team work' (people and systems). Other skills included 'communication' (n = 25; 93 per cent), 'situation awareness' (n = 23; 85 per cent), and 'leadership' (n = 20; 74 per cent). Anatomy and physiology were taught by one intervention, while none taught knowledge areas under work environment. CONCLUSION: Expanding HF education requires a broader inclusion of the entirety of sociotechnical factors such as contributions of the work environment, technology, and broader organizational culture on OR safety to a wider range of stakeholders.	0
34863603	Effects of different feeding regimes on muscle metabolism and its association with meat quality of Tibetan sheep.	This study aimed to explore the effects of different feeding regimes on muscle metabolism and its association with meat quality of Tibetan sheep through correlation analysis of meat quality and differential metabolites using untargeted and targeted metabolomics. The untargeted metabolome was detected by UHPLC-QTOF-MS, and the targeted metabolome was detected by UHPLC-QQQ-MS (amino acids) and GC-MS (fatty acids). Based on the researched results, the nutritional  quality of meat, including the content of protein and fat and the edible quality  of meat, including tenderness, water holding capacity (WHC), texture, and flavor  of Tibetan sheep were superior in the stall-feeding group (GBZ) than in the traditional grazing group (CBZ). In the GBZ group, the key upregulated metabolites and metabolic pathways were dominated by essential amino acids (EAAs) and amino acid metabolism as well as the key downregulated metabolites and metabolic pathways were dominated by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and lipid metabolism. Correlation analysis showed that there was a significant correlation  between the results of untargeted metabolomics and some phenotypic data, including shear force, cooking loss, drip loss, chewiness, elasticity, flavor, and the content of protein and fat. Taken together, stall-feeding would be appropriate for the production of Tibetan mutton, offering better mouthfeel and higher nutrition by altering the muscle metabolism and increasing the beneficial  compound deposition in the muscle.	0
34944243	Are We Approaching Peak Meat Consumption? Analysis of Meat Consumption from 2000  to 2019 in 35 Countries and Its Relationship to Gross Domestic Product.	Growing prosperity, but also disease outbreaks, natural disasters, and consumer preferences are changing global meat consumption. We investigated the 2000-2019 trends in 35 countries monitored by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. We also tested relationships with Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Several countries appeared to be reaching peak consumption of some meats, and three (New Zealand, Canada, and Switzerland) have reached this. Poultry consumption increased over time in most countries, and beef and mutton/lamb consumption decreased in many. Using cluster  analysis, we divided countries into two clusters: one in which increases in GDP per capita matched increases in meat consumption; and a second one of nine countries, for which there was no association between per capita change in GDP and meat consumption. There was evidence of a tipping point around USD 40,000 of  GDP per capita, after which increases in economic well-being do not lead to increased meat consumption.	0
34995879	Association of MHCY genotypes in lines of chickens divergently selected for high  or low antibody response to sheep red blood cells.	The chicken MHCY region contains members of several gene families including a family of highly polymorphic MHC class I genes that are structurally distinct from their classical class I gene counterparts. Genetic variability at MHCY could impart variability in immune responses, but robust tests for whether or not this  occurs have been lacking. Here we defined the MHCY genotypes present in 2 sets of chicken lines selected for high or low antibody response, the Virginia Tech (VT)  HAS and LAS, and the Wageningen University (WU) HA and LA lines. Both sets were developed under long-term bidirectional selection for differences in antibody responses following immunization with the experimental antigen sheep red blood cells. Lines in which selection was relaxed (VT HAR and LAR) or lacking (WU C) provided controls. We looked for evidence of association between MHCY genotypes and antibody titers. Chickens were typed for MHCY using a recently developed method based on a multilocus short tandem repeat sequence found across MHCY haplotypes. Five MHCY haplotypes were found segregating in the VT HAS and LAS lines. One haplotype was present only in HAS chickens, and another was present only in LAS chickens with distribution of the remaining 3 haplotypes differing significantly between the lines. In the WU HA and LA lines, there was a similar MHCY asymmetry. The control populations lacked similar asymmetries. These observations support the likelihood of MHCY genetics affecting heritable antibody responses and provide a basis for further investigations into the role of MHCY region genes in guiding immune responses in chickens.	0
35144720	Clearance of Maedi-visna infection in a longitudinal study of naturally infected  rams is associated with homozygosity for the TMEM154 resistance allele.	Maedi-visna (MV) is a lentiviral disease of sheep responsible for severe production losses in affected flocks. There are no vaccination or treatment options with control reliant on test and cull strategies. The most common diagnostic methods used at present are combination ELISAs for Gag and Env proteins with virus variability making PCR diagnostics still largely an experimental tool. To assess variability in viral loads and diagnostic tests results, serology, DNA and RNA viral loads were measured in the blood of 12 naturally infected rams repeatedly blood sampled over 16 months. Six animals tested negative in one or more tests at one or more time points and would have been missed on screening programmes reliant on one test method or a single time point. In addition the one animal homozygous for the 'K' allele of the TMEM154 E35K SNP maintained very low viral loads in all assays and apparently cleared infection to below detectable limits at the final time point it was sampled. This adds crucial data to the strong epidemiological evidence that this locus represents a genuine resistance marker for MV infection and is a strong candidate for selective breeding of sheep for resistance to disease.	0
35400971	Single and combined effects of CSN1S1 and CSN2-casein genes on Awassi sheep milk  quantity and quality.	Background and Aim: Milk produced from Awassi sheep is of high nutritive value; its production is relatively low in Awassi sheep, so the genetic improvement programs targeted milk production and its components are of high importance, especially when using genes that have an important signal to milk traits. This study was aimed at assessing the influence of alpha S1 (CSN1S1) and beta-casein (CSN2) genes genotypes interaction on Awassi ewes milk productivity. Materials and Methods: A total number of 391 milk yield and its composition records (taken through five consecutive years, 2007-2011) of 167 ewes were utilized for this study. DNA samples were extracted from the ewe's blood samples, then the polymerase chain reaction products of alpha S1 (CSN1S1) and beta-casein  (CSN2) genes were sequenced. The obtained sequences were analyzed; thereafter, the detected variants were tested for their possible association with milk traits. Results: The CSN1S1 and CSN2 variants allelic frequencies were 0.85 and 0.15, and 0.95 and 0.05, respectively. Lactose and solid not fat (SNF) % were associated with TC CSN1S1 genotypes. No association was found among CSN1S1 polymorphic genotypes with milk production, lactose, and SNF % were associated with TC CSN1S1 genotypes. Ewes of CSN2 AC genotype showed higher milk production traits, while no association was found between milk composition traits and CNS2 genotypes. Nevertheless, CSN1S1*CSN2 interaction showed the highest SNF, fat percentages, and milk production. Conclusion: The substantial interaction effects between CSN1S1×CSN2 genes were significantly affected the amount of milk, fat, and SNF% produced. The detected variants should be included in the breeding programs of Awassi sheep that are designed for improving their milk quantity and quality.	0
35406817	Insights into the Genomic Architecture of Seed and Pod Quality Traits in the U.S. Peanut Mini-Core Diversity Panel.	Traits such as seed weight, shelling percent, percent sound mature kernels, and seed dormancy determines the quality of peanut seed. Few QTL (quantitative trait  loci) studies using biparental mapping populations have identified QTL for seed dormancy and seed grade traits. Here, we report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to detect marker-trait associations for seed germination, dormancy, and seed grading traits in peanut. A total of 120 accessions from the U.S. peanut mini-core collection were evaluated for seed quality traits and genotyped using Axiom SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) array for peanut. We observed significant variation in seed quality traits in different accessions and different botanical varieties. Through GWAS, we were able to identify multiple regions associated with sound mature kernels, seed weight, shelling percent, seed germination, and dormancy. Some of the genomic regions that were SNP associated with these traits aligned with previously known QTLs. For instance, QTL for seed  dormancy has been reported on chromosome A05, and we also found SNP on the same chromosome associated with seed dormancy, explaining around 20% of phenotypic variation. In addition, we found novel genomic regions associated with seed grading, seed germination, and dormancy traits. SNP markers associated with seed  quality and dormancy identified here can accelerate the selection process. Further, exploring the function of candidate genes identified in the vicinity of  the associated marker will assist in understanding the complex genetic network that governs seed quality.	0
34700069	Transcriptional downregulation of ABC transporters is related to follicular degeneration after vitrification and in vitro culture of ovine ovarian tissue.	ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters perform multiple functions in reproductive tissues. During ovarian tissue vitrification, the plasma membrane has important functions in the influx or efflux of water, and substances such as  cryoprotectants and channel proteins that are required in this process. Thus, the present study aimed to verify the relative abundance of mRNA transcript of ABC transporters ABCB1, ABCG2, and MRP2 after vitrification and in vitro culture (IVC) of ovine ovarian tissue. For this study, the ovarian cortex fragments were  proportioned into four groups as fresh control, vitrified control, fresh culture, and vitrified culture groups. After vitrification and in vitro culture, the ovarian tissue was evaluated using morphological procedures. Further, relative abundance of ABCB1, ABCG2, and MRP2 transporter mRNA transcripts in the ovarian cortex subjected to aforementioned treatment conditions were evaluated using qPCR. Our results showed a negative association between degenerated follicles and mRNA transcript abundances of ABCB1 and ABCG2. In addition, the percentage of growing follicles in the ovine ovarian cortex after vitrification was similar to  that of the fresh control tissue without in vitro culture. The in vitro culture of fresh and vitrified tissue however, showed a significant decrease in the percentage of growing follicles. To the best of our knowledge, we believe that our data for the first time has studied the relative abundances of ABCB1 and ABCG2 mRNA transcripts in the ovine ovarian cortex. In addition, alterations of these protein channels may be indicative of a deleterious effect of osmotic stress on follicular survival during vitrification. Furthermore, these effects were detectable only after the IVC of the ovarian tissues. Nonetheless, further studies are required to investigate the functions of ABC transporters in ovine folliculogenesis, especially after in vitro culture of ovarian tissue.	0
34944304	Diffuse Alopecia and Thyroid Atrophy in Sheep.	Thyroid dysfunction substantially affects the quality of life due to its association with various disorders in different organs. A low intake of selenium  and zinc can predispose to thyroid alterations, resulting in hypothyroidism. A deficiency of selenium and zinc causes direct and indirect skin lesions, both by  the action of free radicals on the skin and by thyroid dysfunction. The aim of this study was to describe natural cases of diffuse alopecia and thyroid abnormalities in sheep with selenium and zinc deficiency. Five adult sheep presented marked and diffuse alopecia, and the residual hairs were dry and brittle. The skin was thick and crusty, with marked peeling. The triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) serum concentrations were below reference values for the  species. Zinc and Se concentrations were low in both the serum and liver. During  necropsy, cachexia associated with serous fat atrophy was observed, and the thyroid glands showed marked atrophy. Microscopically, the thyroid presented multifocal to coalescent atrophy, with atrophied and dilated follicles, macrophage infiltration, and the presence of fibrous connective tissue. The skin  revealed hyperkeratosis and edema. It is concluded that thyroid atrophy, alopecia, and hyperkeratosis are associated with low serum and liver concentrations of zinc and selenium in sheep.	0
35402911	DNA methylation in relation to gestational age and brain dysmaturation in preterm infants.	Preterm birth is associated with dysconnectivity of structural brain networks and is a leading cause of neurocognitive impairment in childhood. Variation in DNA methylation is associated with early exposure to extrauterine life but there has  been little research exploring its relationship with brain development. Using genome-wide DNA methylation data from the saliva of 258 neonates, we investigated the impact of gestational age on the methylome and performed functional analysis  to identify enriched gene sets from probes that contributed to differentially methylated probes or regions. We tested the hypothesis that variation in DNA methylation could underpin the association between low gestational age at birth and atypical brain development by linking differentially methylated probes with measures of white matter connectivity derived from diffusion MRI metrics: peak width skeletonized mean diffusivity, peak width skeletonized fractional anisotropy and peak width skeletonized neurite density index. Gestational age at  birth was associated with widespread differential methylation at term equivalent  age, with genome-wide significant associations observed for 8870 CpG probes (P < 3.6 × 10-8) and 1767 differentially methylated regions. Functional analysis  identified 14 enriched gene ontology terms pertaining to cell-cell contacts and cell-extracellular matrix contacts. Principal component analysis of probes with genome-wide significance revealed a first principal component that explained 23.5% of the variance in DNA methylation, and this was negatively associated with gestational age at birth. The first principal component was associated with peak  width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (β = 0.349, P = 8.37 × 10-10) and peak width skeletonized neurite density index (β = 0.364, P = 4.15 × 10-5), but not with peak width skeletonized fraction anisotropy (β = -0.035, P = 0.510); these relationships mirrored the imaging metrics' associations with gestational age at  birth. Low gestational age at birth has a profound and widely distributed effect  on the neonatal saliva methylome that is apparent at term equivalent age. Enriched gene ontology terms related to cell-cell contacts reveal pathways that could mediate the effect of early life environmental exposures on development. Finally, associations between differential DNA methylation and image markers of white matter tract microstructure suggest that variation in DNA methylation may provide a link between preterm birth and the dysconnectivity of developing brain  networks that characterizes atypical brain development in preterm infants.	0
35251778	Extensive sheep grazing is associated with trends in steppe birds in Spain: recommendations for the Common Agricultural Policy.	Iberian natural steppes have traditionally been used for extensive sheep grazing, which has been noted to be positively associated with steppe bird abundance and diversity. Sheep numbers in Spain, which harbors the largest European populations of many steppe bird species, decreased by 9.2 million (37.3%) between 1992 and 2020. Steppe birds in Spain have faced dramatic declines during the same period,  but there is a lack of knowledge about the potential association between sheep and open-habitat bird declines. We used sheep data from the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture and bird data (1998-2018) from the Spanish Common Bird Monitoring Program to assess the association at the Spanish scale between sheep decline and  the Farmland Bird Index (FBI) and the Natural Shrub-steppe Bird Index (SBI). We also used an independent dataset on population trends of the Dupont's Lark (Chersophilus duponti) to assess the relationship between sheep numbers and the decline of this threatened steppe specialist passerine in Spain, whose European population is restricted to Iberian natural steppes. To test for a spurious relationship between temporal series, variables were tested for cointegration. After confirming cointegration, we found a strong positive relationship between sheep abundance and the trends of the FBI and SBI indices during the period 1998-2018. The association between sheep abundance and trends of the Dupont's Lark (2004-2015) was positive although it was not statistically significant. Although the main causes of decline of farmland and steppe birds are mainly related to agricultural intensification and land use changes, the correlation found, using two independent cointegrated datasets, between the reduction in farmland and shrub-steppe birds and sheep numbers at the country scale suggests that the decline of steppe birds in Spain may be also associated with the decline in sheep numbers. This agrees with previous studies that found a positive relationship between intermediate levels of sheep grazing and steppe bird abundance in Iberian steppes. Further research (e.g. experimental studies) is needed to corroborate our study and identify the most appropriate level of grazing intensity for protecting the most farmland and shrub-steppe birds. Our results suggest that the promotion of extensive grazing should be considered as a key factor in future Common Agricultural Policy reforms and conservation programmes to protect steppe birds.	0
34869731	Molecular Characterization of a Tetraspanin TSP11 Gene in Echinococcus granulosus and Evaluation Its Immunoprotection in Model Dogs.	Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a cosmopolitan zoonosis caused by the larval stage  of Echinococcus granulosus, which affects humans and a wide range of mammalian intermediate hosts. Parasite tetraspanin proteins are crucial for host-parasite interactions, and therefore they may be useful for vaccine development or disease diagnosis. In the present study, the major antigen coding sequence of tetraspanin 11 (Eg-TSP11) from E. granulosus was determined. The results of immunolocalization showed that Eg-TSP11 was mainly located in the tegument of adult worms and protoscoleces. Western blotting analysis showed that the serum from dogs injected with recombinant Eg-TSP11 (rEg-TSP11) could recognize Eg-TSP11 among natural protoscolex proteins. Moreover, the serum from dogs with E. granulosus infection also recognized rEg-TSP11. Serum indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays demonstrated that IgG levels gradually increased after the first immunization with rEg-TSP11 compared with those in the control group. Furthermore, the serum levels of interleukin 4, interleukin 5, and interferon gamma were significantly altered in the rEg-TSP11 group. Importantly, we found that vaccination with rEg-TSP11 significantly decreased worm burden and inhibited segment development in a dog model of E. granulosus infection. Based on these findings, we speculated that rEg-TSP11 might be a potential candidate vaccine antigen against E. granulosus infection in dogs.	0
34379287	Identification of sequence variation in the oocyte-derived bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP15) gene (BMP15) associated with litter size in New Zealand sheep  (Ovis aries) breeds.	Advances in the study of reproductive traits indicate that functional variation in fertility genes may be useful for improving sheep fertility. The aim of this study was to search for variation in the bone morphogenetic protein 15 gene (BMP15) and ascertain any association with litter size in purebred Finnish Landrace sheep (n = 148), Finnish Landrace × Texel-cross sheep (n = 45), and composite sheep (of varying breed background; n = 58) from New Zealand (NZ). A 482 bp and 312 bp fragment of exon 1 and 2, respectively, of BMP15 were analysed  using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP). The additive and dominance effect of BMP15 variation on litter size were estimated using animal and sire models. Two variants (A and B) were detected in exon 1; no sequence variation was detected in exon 2. Variant A had the nucleotide sequence CTT between positions c.31 and c.33, while variant B had a deletion (c.31_33del). The observed frequency for variant A in the Finnish Landrace sheep, Finnish Landrace × Texel-cross sheep and the composite sheep, was 0.77, 0.92, and 0.68, respectively while the frequency of variant B (c.31_33del)  was 0.23, 0.08, and 0.32, respectively. An association between litter size and c.31_33del (P < 0.001) was observed in composite sheep. Analysis of more sheep will be required to confirm these results. Litter size did not differ significantly between sheep breeds regardless of the presence/absence of c.31_33del. Results suggested that c.31_33del might be a genetic marker for improving fecundity in some NZ sheep.	0
35428998	Genomic analysis of 10 years of artificial selection in community-based breeding  programs in two Ethiopian indigenous sheep breeds.	In recent times, community-based breeding programs (CBBPs) have been advocated as the best strategy for genetic improvement of local breeds in smallholder farms in developing countries. Since 2009, CBBPs have been implemented for Ethiopian Bonga and Menz sheep to improve growth rates resulting in significant genetic gains in  6-month weights. With the hypothesis that selection could be impacting their genomes, we systematically screened for possible genome changes in the two breeds by analyzing 600K BeadChip genotype data of 151 individuals (with the highest breeding values for 6-month weights) from CBBP flocks against 98 individuals from non-CBBP flocks. We observed no differences in genetic diversity and demographic  dynamics between CBBP and non-CBBP flocks. Selection signature analysis employing ROH, logistic regression genome-wide association study, FST , XP-EHH and iHS revealed 5 (Bonga) and 11 (Menz) overlapping regions under selection, that co-localized with QTLs for production (body size/weight, growth, milk yield), meat/milk quality, and health/parasite resistance, suggesting that the decade-long selection has likely started to impact their genomes. However, genome-wide genetic differentiation between the CBBP and non-CBBP flocks is not yet clearly evident.	0
34721524	A Comprehensive Comparison of Haplotype-Based Single-Step Genomic Predictions in  Livestock Populations With Different Genetic Diversity Levels: A Simulation Study.	The level of genetic diversity in a population is inversely proportional to the linkage disequilibrium (LD) between individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and quantitative trait loci (QTLs), leading to lower predictive ability of genomic breeding values (GEBVs) in high genetically diverse populations. Haplotype-based predictions could outperform individual SNP predictions by better capturing the LD between SNP and QTL. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the accuracy and bias of individual-SNP- and haplotype-based genomic predictions under the single-step-genomic best linear unbiased prediction (ssGBLUP) approach  in genetically diverse populations. We simulated purebred and composite sheep populations using literature parameters for moderate and low heritability traits. The haplotypes were created based on LD thresholds of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.6. Pseudo-SNPs from unique haplotype alleles were used to create the genomic relationship matrix ( G ) in the ssGBLUP analyses. Alternative scenarios were compared in which the pseudo-SNPs were combined with non-LD clustered SNPs, only  pseudo-SNPs, or haplotypes fitted in a second G (two relationship matrices). The  GEBV accuracies for the moderate heritability-trait scenarios fitting individual  SNPs ranged from 0.41 to 0.55 and with haplotypes from 0.17 to 0.54 in the most (Ne ≅ 450) and less (Ne < 200) genetically diverse populations, respectively, and the bias fitting individual SNPs or haplotypes ranged between -0.14 and -0.08 and from -0.62 to -0.08, respectively. For the low heritability-trait scenarios, the  GEBV accuracies fitting individual SNPs ranged from 0.24 to 0.32, and for fitting haplotypes, it ranged from 0.11 to 0.32 in the more (Ne   ≅ 250) and less (Ne   ≅ 100) genetically diverse populations, respectively, and the bias ranged between -0.36 and -0.32 and from -0.78 to -0.33 fitting individual SNPs or haplotypes, respectively. The lowest accuracies and largest biases were observed fitting only pseudo-SNPs from blocks constructed with an LD threshold of 0.3 (p < 0.05), whereas the best results were obtained using only SNPs or the combination of independent SNPs and pseudo-SNPs in one or two G matrices, in both heritability levels and all populations regardless of the level of genetic diversity. In summary, haplotype-based models did not improve the performance of genomic predictions in genetically diverse populations.	0
34609166	Metagenomic Sequencing Reveals that High-Grain Feeding Alters the Composition and Metabolism of Cecal Microbiota and Induces Cecal Mucosal Injury in Sheep.	The cecum serves as an additional fermentation site for ruminants, but it lacks buffering capacity and has a relatively simple epithelial structure compared to the rumen. The role of high-grain (HG) diets in manipulating the rumen microbiome has been well elucidated, yet the microbial response to such diets in the cecum and the subsequent microbe-host interactions remain largely unexplored. Here, we  describe the modification of the cecal microbiome and host epithelial gene expression based on data from 20 sheep grouped to feed an HG diet for 7, 14, and  28 days. Our data indicate that the alteration of cecal microbial fermentation was manifested by a decrease in luminal pH and an increase in acetate and butyrate concentrations following the diet change to HG. We further demonstrate that the alteration of the microbiome was driven by microbes that are likely acetate producers (e.g., Blautia spp. and Akkermansia spp.) and butyrate producers (e.g., Anaerostipes spp. and Roseburia spp.). Moreover, the core microbiota in the cecal microbiome was predominantly maintained after HG diet feeding, while the specific populations of the cecal microbiomes adaptively varied at the species and genomic levels time dependently. Association analysis suggests that the perturbations of the cecal microbiome under the HG diet were closely linked to the variations in the two key enzymes that catalyze the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and urease enzymes that hydrolyze urea into  ammonia, alongside mucosal inflammatory responses. Overall, our findings here provide novel insights into understanding microbiome-host interactions in the hindgut of ruminants. IMPORTANCE High-grain (HG) diets are known to alter the rumen microbiome. However, the responses of the hindgut microbiota and its epithelial function need further investigation in ruminants. Using 20 sheep as the experimental model, we found that the microbial fermentation pattern of the cecum changed after switching to the HG diet. The taxa of the acetate and butyrate producers increased with the feeding time. Moreover, enzymes engaged in  carbon and nitrogen metabolisms of the cecal microbiome are altered. The expression of epithelial genes related to volatile fatty acid (VFA) absorption and metabolism, cytokines, and tight junction proteins, alongside light microscopy visualization of epithelial tissue, suggested that the HG diet may induce cecal mucosal inflammatory responses. Our findings reveal cecal microbial  and metabolic perturbations in response to HG diets in sheep and provide a new reference for the research on hindgut microbial homeostasis and host health in ruminants.	0
34674211	The Impact of Altitude at Birth on Perinatal Respiratory Support for Neonates with Trisomy 21.	OBJECTIVE:  Both high altitude and trisomy 21 (T21) status can negatively impact  respiratory outcomes. The objective of this study was to examine the association  between altitude and perinatal respiratory support in neonates with T21 compared  with those without T21. STUDY DESIGN:  This retrospective cohort study used the United States all-county  natality files that included live, singleton, in-hospital births from 2015 to 2019. Descriptive statistics for neonates with and without the primary outcome of sustained assisted ventilation (>6 hours) were compared using t-tests and Chi-squared analyses. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association between respiratory support and the presence of T21, and included an  interaction term to determine whether the association between respiratory support and the presence of T21 was modified by elevation at delivery. RESULTS:  A total of 17,939,006 neonates, 4,059 (0.02%) with T21 and 17,934,947 (99.98%) without, were included in the study. The odds of requiring sustained respiratory support following delivery were 5.95 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.31, 6.66), 4.06 (95% CI: 2.39, 6.89), 2.36 (95% CI: 1.64, 3.40), and 5.04 (95%  CI: 1.54, 16.54) times as high for neonates with T21 than without T21 when born at low, medium, high, and very high elevations, respectively. The odds of requiring immediate ventilation support following delivery were 5.01 (95% CI: 4.59, 5.46), 5.90 (95% CI: 4.16, 8.36), 2.86 (95% CI: 2.15, 3.80), and 12.08 (95% CI: 6.78, 21.51) times as high for neonates with T21 than without T21 when born at low, medium, high, and very high elevation, respectively. CONCLUSION:  Neonates with T21 have increased odds of requiring respiratory support following delivery when compared with neonates without T21 at all categories of altitude. However, the odds ratios did not increase monotonically with altitude which indicates additional research is critical in understanding the effects of altitude on neonates with T21. KEY POINTS: · Neonates with T21 have an increased need for perinatal respiratory  support at all altitudes.. · The odds of needing perinatal respiratory support did not increase monotonically with elevation.. · Additional research is critical to understanding the effects of altitude on neonates with T21..	0
34775926	Polymorphism and expression of the HMGA1 gene and association with tail fat deposition in Hu sheep.	Hu sheep is an excellent short fat-tailed breed in China. Fat deposition in Hu sheep tail affects carcass quality and consumes a lot of energy, leading to an increase in feed cost. The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of  HMGA1 polymorphism on tail fat weight in Hu sheep. Partial coding and non-coding  sequences of HMGA1 were amplified with PCR and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of HMGA1 in 1163 Hu sheep were detected using DNA sequencing and KASPar technology. RT-qPCR analysis was performed to test HMGA1 expression in different  tissues. The results showed that the expression of HMGA1 was higher in the duodenum, liver, spleen, kidney, and lung than in the heart, muscle, rumen, tail  fat, and lymph. A mutation, g.5312 C > T, was detected in HMGA1; g.5312 C > T was significantly associated with tail fat weight, relative weight of tail fat (body  weight), and relative weight of tail fat (carcass) (p < 0.05). The tail fat weight of the TT genotype was remarkably higher than that of the CC and TC genotypes. Therefore, HMGA1 can be used as a genetic marker for marker-assisted selection of tail fat weight in Hu sheep.	0
34714701	Transplant of Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells Halts Fatty Atrophy of Detached Rotator Cuff Muscle After Tendon Repair: Molecular, Microscopic, and Macroscopic  Results From an Ovine Model.	BACKGROUND: The injection of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) mitigates fat accumulation in released rotator cuff muscle after tendon repair in rodents. PURPOSE: To investigate whether the injection of autologous MSCs halts muscle-to-fat conversion after tendon repair in a large animal model for rotator  cuff tendon release via regional effects on extracellular fat tissue and muscle fiber regeneration. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Infraspinatus (ISP) muscles of the right shoulder of Swiss Alpine sheep  (n = 14) were released by osteotomy and reattached 16 weeks later without (group  T; n = 6) or with (group T-MSC; n = 8) electropulse-assisted injection of 0.9 Mio fluorescently labeled MSCs as microtissues with media in demarcated regions; animals were allowed 6 weeks of recovery. ISP volume and composition were documented with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Area percentages of muscle fiber types, fat, extracellular ground substance, and fluorescence-positive tissue; mean cross-sectional area (MCSA) of muscle fibers;  and expression of myogenic (myogenin), regeneration (tenascin-C), and adipogenic  markers (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma [PPARG2]) were quantified in injected and noninjected regions after recovery. RESULTS: At 16 weeks after tendon release, the ISP volume was reduced and the fat fraction of ISP muscle was increased in group T (137 vs 185 mL; 49% vs 7%) and group T-MSC (130 vs 166 mL; 53% vs 10%). In group T-MSC versus group T, changes during recovery after tendon reattachment were abrogated for fat-free mass (-5% vs -29%, respectively; P = .018) and fat fraction (+1% vs +24%, respectively; P = .009%). The area percentage of fat was lower (9% vs 20%; P = .018) and the percentage of the extracellular ground substance was higher (26% vs 20%; P = .007) in the noninjected ISP region for group T-MSC versus group T, respectively. Regionally, MCS injection increased tenascin-C levels (+59%) and the water fraction, maintaining the reduced PPARG2 levels but not the 29% increased fiber MCSA, with media injection. CONCLUSION: In a sheep model, injection of autologous MSCs in degenerated rotator cuff muscle halted muscle-to-fat conversion during recovery from tendon repair by preserving fat-free mass in association with extracellular reactions and stopping adjuvant-induced muscle fiber hypertrophy. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A relatively small dose of MSCs is therapeutically effective  to halt fatty atrophy in a large animal model.	0
34498889	Heavy drinking and drinking harms for cisgender and transgender college students.	Objective: We examined alcohol use and harms, and their interrelations among cisgender and transgender college students. Method: We conducted a secondary analysis using a U.S. sample of 4-year-college students (n = 242,624; Mage = 20.24, SD = 1.67; 12.31% Hispanic/Latinx and 62.11% non-Hispanic/Latinx White, 3.99% Black, 11.88% Asian or Pacific Islander,0.37% American Indian, Alaskan Native or Native Hawaiian, 9.35% Multiracial/ethnic/other). These outcomes were compared between cisgender women (68.53%) and cisgender men (29.27%), transgender men (0.91%), transgender women (0.23%), and nonbinary students (1.06%): level (number of drinks) of recent alcohol use, frequency of binge drinking (≥ 5 drinks) in the past 2 weeks, and occurrence and count of harms while drinking in  the past year. Gender differences in the association between drinking level and consequences were also examined. Results: Cisgender women were the reference group for all of the comparisons. Cisgender men reported less occurrence of regret, sex without their consent, and unprotected sex when drinking, but the greater occurrence of injury and trouble with the police. Transgender women and nonbinary individuals reported lower odds of regret and unprotected sex when drinking. Transgender men and nonbinary individuals reported increased odds of sex without their consent when drinking. All transgender subgroups reported increased odds of suicidal ideation when drinking. Finally, associations between  the level of recent drinking and odds of experiencing harms differed by gender identity. Conclusions: Patterns of alcohol use, consequences, and their interrelationship differed for cisgender men, transgender women and men, and nonbinary individuals relative to cisgender women. There is a need for gender-inclusive prevention for alcohol harms among students. (PsycInfo Database  Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).	0
34627407	Equine grass sickness (a multiple systems neuropathy) is associated with alterations in the gastrointestinal mycobiome.	BACKGROUND: Equine grass sickness (EGS) is a multiple systems neuropathy of grazing horses of unknown aetiology. An apparently identical disease occurs in cats, dogs, rabbits, hares, sheep, alpacas and llamas. Many of the risk factors for EGS are consistent with it being a pasture mycotoxicosis. To identify potential causal fungi, the gastrointestinal mycobiota of EGS horses were evaluated using targeted amplicon sequencing, and compared with those of two control groups. Samples were collected post mortem from up to 5 sites in the gastrointestinal tracts of EGS horses (EGS group; 150 samples from 54 horses) and from control horses that were not grazing EGS pastures and that had been euthanased for reasons other than neurologic and gastrointestinal diseases (CTRL  group; 67 samples from 31 horses). Faecal samples were also collected from healthy control horses that were co-grazing pastures with EGS horses at disease onset (CoG group; 48 samples from 48 horses). RESULTS: Mycobiota at all 5 gastrointestinal sites comprised large numbers of fungi exhibiting diverse taxonomy, growth morphology, trophic mode and ecological guild. FUNGuild analysis parsed most phylotypes as ingested environmental microfungi, agaricoids and yeasts, with only 1% as gastrointestinal adapted animal endosymbionts. Mycobiota richness varied throughout the gastrointestinal tract and was greater in EGS horses. There were significant inter-group and inter-site differences in mycobiota structure. A large number of phylotypes were  differentially abundant among groups. Key phylotypes (n = 56) associated with EGS were identified that had high abundance and high prevalence in EGS samples, significantly increased abundance in EGS samples, and were important determinants of the inter-group differences in mycobiota structure. Many key phylotypes were extremophiles and/or were predicted to produce cytotoxic and/or neurotoxic extrolites. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported molecular characterisation of the gastrointestinal mycobiota of grazing horses. Key phylotypes associated with EGS  were identified. Further work is required to determine whether neurotoxic extrolites from key phylotypes contribute to EGS aetiology or whether the association of key phylotypes and EGS is a consequence of disease or is non-causal.	0
34904532	Polymorphisms in the ovine GP5 gene associated with blood physiological indices.	This study aimed to analyze the effects of polymorphisms in GP5 on blood physiological indices of 1065 sheep. The coefficients of variation of the red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin concentration (HGB), mean platelet volume (MPV), mean erythrocyte hemoglobin content (MCH), and red blood cell distribution-coefficient of variation (RDW-CV) were greater than 10%, and there was a very significant correlation between the main indices such as RBC, white blood cell, and platelet count (PLT) and most other indices (p < 0.01). qRT-PCR showed that GP5 was expressed in the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, rumen, duodenum, muscle, tail fat, and lymph tissue, with significantly higher expression in the lymph. Subsequently, we detected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GP5 from group, which identified synonymous mutation g.657 T > C in the first exon of GP5. Association analysis showed significant correlations between the SNP and the physiological traits (p < 0.05), in which the RBC, neutrophilic granulocyte (NEUT) and RDW-CV values in sheep with the TC genotype and TT genotype were markedly lower than those in the CC genotype (p < 0.05). Thus, GP5 polymorphisms could be candidate biomarkers to screen blood physiological indices.	0
35088174	Association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CAPN, CAST, LEP, GH, and IGF-1 genes with growth parameters and ultrasound characteristics of the Longissimus dorsi muscle in Colombian hair sheep.	Recognition of the genes that influence livestock production characteristics has  allowed researchers to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with phenotypic traits that contribute to higher productivity. The objective of this research was to associate SNPs in the genes calpain (CAPN), calpastatin (CAST), leptin (LEP), growth hormone (GH), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) with the growth characteristics birth weight (BW), weaning weight adjusted at 120 days (WW), daily pre-weaning gain (PRADG), adjusted weight at 210 days (AW210), and daily post-weaning gain (POADG), and the measures of the Longissimus dorsi muscle based on ultrasound, namely loin eye area (LEA), loin depth (LD), and back fat thickness (BFT), in Colombian hair sheep (OPC). The association between phenotypic and genotypic characteristics was made using the PLINK v.1.9 program using linear regression analysis. There was a statistically significant association (p < 0.05) between the CAST polymorphism (M/N) and BW, a  tendency (p = 0.07) for an association between the T → C SNP of the CAPN gene and AW210, and a trend (p = 0.07) for an association between the A → G SNP of the IGF-1 locus and POADG. The LEA and BFT characteristics were not associated with a SNP, while PL was significantly affected by SNPs in the GH and IGF-1 genes. In conclusion, all the genes evaluated were polymorphic, the CAST gene significantly influenced BW, and the GH and IGF-1 genes were associated with LD characteristics. These results could be used to identify individuals with favorable genotypes to implement a marker-assisted selection method.	0
34543455	Association between novel variants in BMPR1B gene and litter size in Mongolia and Ujimqin sheep breeds.	Prolificacy is an important trait of animals, specifically for sheep. The Bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1B (BMPR1B) is a major gene affecting the litter size of many sheep breeds. The well-known FecB mutation (Q249R) was associated fully with the hyper prolific phenotype of Booroola Merino. However, the identification of variation in all exonic regions of BMPR1B was rare. In this study, we sequenced all exonic regions of BMPR1B gene of Mongolia sheep breed, and ten novel variants were detected by direct sequencing. Among them, the litter size of the Mongolia ewes with the CC genotype was significantly higher (0.34 additional lambs, p < .05) than those with the TT genotype of the g.29346567C>T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The litter size of the Mongolia ewes with the TT genotype was significantly higher (0.19 additional lambs, p < .05 and .31  additional lambs, p < .01, respectively) than those with the GT and GG genotypes  of the c.1470G>T SNP. The silent c.1470G>T mutation is predicted to increase the  stability of the mRNA secondary structure through reducing minimum free energy and is predicted to change the mRNA secondary structure of BMPR1B. Our findings may give potentially useful genetic markers for increasing litter size in sheep.	0
34571323	Evaluation of a Cooperia oncophora double-domain ASP-based vaccine against Cooperia spp. infections in cattle and sheep.	A double-domain activation-associated secreted protein (dd-Co-ASP) isolated from  the bovine small intestinal parasite Cooperia oncophora was previously shown to be an effective vaccine candidate to protect calves against a homologous challenge infection. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the dd-Co-ASP protein, purified from a Belgian C. oncophora isolate, would offer protection against a C. oncophora isolate from the southern hemisphere as well as other Cooperia species such as C. punctata in cattle and C. curticei in sheep. Two vaccination studies were performed, i.e. one in cattle and one in sheep, in which the protective effects of dd-Co-ASP, supplemented with Quil A as an adjuvant, were compared with an adjuvant control. Whereas our results showed a 75 % reduction in Cooperia spp. cumulative faecal egg counts, the results obtained in sheep demonstrated that dd-Co-ASP was ineffective in raising a protective immune response against a C. curticei challenge infection. Even though sequence analysis of the dd-Co-ASP gene revealed restricted sequence heterogeneity in the  double domain ASP within and between bovine Cooperia species, the results of the  vaccine study suggest that there is sufficient conservation at the protein level  to yield cross-protection, holding promise for the development of a general Cooperia vaccine for use in cattle.	0
34946875	Genome-Wide Selective Signatures Reveal Candidate Genes Associated with Hair Follicle Development and Wool Shedding in Sheep.	Hair follicle development and wool shedding in sheep are poorly understood. This  study investigated the population structures and genetic differences between sheep with different wool types to identify candidate genes related to these traits. We used Illumina ovine SNP 50K chip genotyping data of 795 sheep populations comprising 27 breeds with two wool types, measuring the population differentiation index (Fst), nucleotide diversity (θπ ratio), and extended haplotype homozygosity among populations (XP-EHH) to detect the selective signatures of hair sheep and fine-wool sheep. The top 5% of the Fst and θπ ratio  values, and values of XP-EHH < -2 were considered strongly selected SNP sites. Annotation showed that the PRX, SOX18, TGM3, and TCF3 genes related to hair follicle development and wool shedding were strongly selected. Our results indicated that these methods identified important genes related to hair follicle  formation, epidermal differentiation, and hair follicle stem cell development, and provide a meaningful reference for further study on the molecular mechanisms  of economically important traits in sheep.	0
35327994	Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis of Hu Sheep Pituitary Gland Prolificacy at the Follicular and Luteal Phases.	The pituitary gland directly regulates the reproduction of domestic animals. Research has increasingly focused on the potential regulatory mechanism of non-coding RNA in pituitary development. Little is known about the differential expression pattern of lncRNAs in Hu sheep, a famous sheep breed with high fecundity, and its role in the pituitary gland between the follicular phase and luteal phase. Herein, to identify the transcriptomic differences of the sheep pituitary gland during the estrus cycle, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed.  The results showed that 3529 lncRNAs and 16,651 mRNAs were identified in the pituitary gland. Among of them, 144 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNA transcripts and 557 DE mRNA transcripts were screened in the follicular and luteal phases. Moreover, GO and KEGG analyses demonstrated that 39 downregulated  and 22 upregulated genes interacted with pituitary functions and reproduction. Lastly, the interaction of the candidate lncRNA XR_001039544.4 and its targeted gene LHB were validated in sheep pituitary cells in vitro. LncRNA XR_001039544.4  and LHB showed high expression levels in the luteal phase in Hu sheep. LncRNA XR_001039544.4 is mainly located in the cytoplasm, as determined by FISH analysis, indicating that XR_001039544.4 might act as competing endogenous RNAs for miRNAs to regulate LHB. LncRNA XR_001039544.4 knockdown significantly inhibited LH secretion and cell proliferation. LncRNA XR_001039544.4 may regulate the secretion of LH in the luteal-phase pituitary gland via affecting cell proliferation. Taken together, these findings provided genome-wide lncRNA- and mRNA-expression profiles for the sheep pituitary gland between the follicular and luteal phases, thereby contributing to the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of pituitary function.	0
34944305	Detection of Novel Variations Related to Litter Size in BMP15 Gene of Luzhong Mutton Sheep (Ovis aries).	Litter size is an important economic trait in the mutton sheep industry. BMP15 is one of the key candidate genes for litter size in sheep. In this study, the entire ORF region of BMP15 was sequenced in 154 Luzhong mutton ewes, and the novel variations were determined. The association between polymorphism in BMP15 and litter size was analyzed using a general linear model. Six out of a total of  thirteen variations were identified to be novel. Association analysis indicated that four (SNPs ENSOART00000010201.1:c.352+342C>A, c.352+1232T>C, c.352+1165A>G and c.353-2036T>A) were significantly associated with litter size. The joint analysis among three major genes (BMP15, BMPR1B and GDF9) exhibited significant interaction effects in three combinations (FecB and c.352+1232T>C of BMP15; FecB  and c.352+1165A>G of BMP15; c.352+342C>A of BMP15 and ENSOART00000014382.1:c.994G>A of GDF9). For the SNPs c.352+1232T>C and c.352+342C>A, the global distribution of allele frequencies showed that the highest variation frequency occurs in Western Europe. In conclusion, the results  demonstrated that BMP15 is a major gene for litter size in Luzhong mutton sheep and candidate SNPs associated with litter size were identified.	0
34546582	Mitochondrial Calcium uniporters are essential for meiotic progression in mouse oocytes by controlling Ca2+ entry.	OBJECTIVES: The alteration of bioenergetics by oocytes in response to the demands of various biological processes plays a critical role in maintaining normal cellular physiology. However, little is known about the association between energy sensing and energy production with energy-dependent cellular processes like meiosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We demonstrated that cell cycle-dependent mitochondrial Ca2+ connects energy sensing to mitochondrial activity in meiosis progression within mouse oocytes. Further, we established a model in mouse oocytes using siRNA knockdowns that target mitochondrial calcium uniporters (MCUs) in order to  inhibit mitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations. RESULTS: Decreased numbers of oocytes successfully progressed to the germinal vesicle stage and extruded the first polar body during in vitro culture after inhibition, while spindle checkpoint-dependent meiosis was also delayed. Mitochondrial Ca2+ levels changed, and this was followed by altered mitochondrial masses and ATP levels within oocytes during the entirety of meiosis progression.  Abnormal mitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations in oocytes then hindered meiotic progress and activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling that is associated with gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide new insight into the protective role that MCU-dependent mitochondrial Ca2+ signalling plays in meiotic progress, in addition to demonstrating a new mechanism of mitochondrial energy regulation by AMPK signalling that influences meiotic maturation.	0
34724628	High Prevalence of Asymptomatic Malarial Anemia and Association with Early Conversion from Asymptomatic to Symptomatic Infection in a Plasmodium falciparum  Hyperendemic Setting in Cameroon.	Asymptomatic malarial parasitemia is highly prevalent in Plasmodium falciparum endemic areas and often associated with increased prevalence of mild to moderate  anemia. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of anemia during asymptomatic malaria parasitemia and its interplay with persistent infection in highly exposed individuals. A household-based longitudinal survey was undertaken  in a malaria hyperendemic area in Cameroon using multiplex nested polymerase chain reaction to detect plasmodial infections. Residents with P. falciparum asymptomatic parasitemia were monitored over a 3-week period with the aid of structured questionnaires and weekly measurements of axillary temperatures. Of the 353 individuals included (median age: 26 years, range 2-86 years, male/female sex ratio 0.9), 328 (92.9%) were positive for malaria parasitemia of whom 266 (81.1%) were asymptomatic carriers. The prevalence of anemia in the study population was 38.6%, of which 69.2% were asymptomatic. Multivariate analyses identified high parasitemia (> 327 parasites/µL) and female gender as associated  risk factors of asymptomatic malarial anemia in the population. Furthermore, risk analyses revealed female gender and anemia at the time of enrolment as key predictors of early development of febrile illness (< 3 weeks post enrolment) among the asymptomatic individuals. Together, the data reveal an extremely high prevalence of asymptomatic malaria parasitemia and anemia in the study area, unveiling for the first time the association of asymptomatic malarial anemia with early clinical conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic infection. Furthermore, these findings underscore the negative impact of asymptomatic malaria parasitemia on individual health, necessitating the development of appropriate control and preventive measures.	0
35406677	L-Type Cav1.3 Calcium Channels Are Required for Beta-Adrenergic Triggered Automaticity in Dormant Mouse Sinoatrial Pacemaker Cells.	"BACKGROUND: Sinoatrial node cells (SANC) automaticity is generated by functional  association between the activity of plasmalemmal ion channels and local diastolic intracellular Ca2+ release (LCR) from ryanodine receptors. Strikingly, most isolated SANC exhibit a ""dormant"" state, whereas only a fraction shows regular firing as observed in intact SAN. Recent studies showed that β-adrenergic stimulation can initiate spontaneous firing in dormant SANC, though this mechanism is not entirely understood. METHODS: To investigate the role of L-type Cav1.3 Ca2+ channels in the adrenergic regulation of automaticity in dormant SANC, we used a knock-in mouse strain in which the sensitivity of L-type Cav1.2 α1 subunits to dihydropyridines (DHPs) was inactivated (Cav1.2DHP-/-), enabling the selective pharmacological inhibition of  Cav1.3 by DHPs. RESULTS: In dormant SANC, β-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol (ISO) induced spontaneous action potentials (AP) and Ca2+ transients, which were completely arrested with concomitant perfusion of the DHP nifedipine. In spontaneously firing SANC at baseline, Cav1.3 inhibition completely reversed the  effect of β-adrenergic stimulation on AP and the frequency of Ca2+ transients. Confocal calcium imaging of SANC showed that the β-adrenergic-induced synchronization of LCRs is regulated by the activity of Cav1.3 channels. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows a novel role of Cav1.3 channels in initiating and maintaining automaticity in dormant SANC upon β-adrenergic stimulation."	0
34973142	Prevalence of Pathogenic and Potentially Pathogenic Inborn Error of Immunity Associated Variants in Children with Severe Sepsis.	PURPOSE: Our understanding of inborn errors of immunity is increasing; however, their contribution to pediatric sepsis is unknown. METHODS: We used whole-exome sequencing (WES) to characterize variants in genes related to monogenic immunologic disorders in 330 children admitted to intensive  care for severe sepsis. We defined candidate variants as rare variants classified as pathogenic or potentially pathogenic in QIAGEN's Human Gene Mutation Database  or novel null variants in a disease-consistent inheritance pattern. We investigated variant correlation with infection and inflammatory phenotype. RESULTS: More than one in two children overall and three of four African American children had immunodeficiency-associated variants. Children with variants had increased odds of isolating a blood or urinary pathogen (blood: OR 2.82, 95% CI:  1.12-7.10, p = 0.023, urine: OR: 8.23, 95% CI: 1.06-64.11, p = 0.016) and demonstrating increased inflammation with hyperferritinemia (ferritin [Formula: see text] ng/mL, OR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.28-3.66, p = 0.004), lymphopenia (lymphocyte count < 1000/µL, OR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.06 - 2.60, p = 0.027), thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 150,000/µL, OR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.12-2.76, p = 0.013), and CRP greater than 10 mg/dl (OR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.10-2.68, p = 0.017). They also had increased odds of requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, OR: 4.19,  95% CI: 1.21-14.5, p = 0.019). CONCLUSION: Herein, we describe the genetic findings in this severe pediatric sepsis cohort and their microbiologic and immunologic significance, providing evidence for the phenotypic effect of these variants and rationale for screening  children with life-threatening infections for potential inborn errors of immunity.	0
35325642	A novel p.K116Q SNP in the OLR1 gene and its relation to fecundity in Awassi ewes.	Sheep's fecundity is determined by both twinning rate and litter size, both influenced by several genes, one of which is the OLR1 (oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor) gene. This study aimed to determine the genetic variation of the OLR1 gene affecting the fecundity traits of Awassi ewes. The genomic DNA from 114 ewes with a single progeny and 86 ewes with twins was extracted. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify three fragments (334 bp, 291  bp, and 274 bp) (exon 3, exon 4, and exon 6) of the OLR1 gene. Two genotypes of 334-bp amplicons - CC and CA - were detected. In a sequence reaction, the novel mutation p.K116Q was discovered in CA genotypes. There was a highly significant (P ≤ 0.01) association between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and reproductive traits, in that ewes with the p.K116Q SNP had lower litter size, twinning rate, fecundity, and lambing percentages than ewes with the CC genotype. These observations imply that the missense p.K116Q variant has an adverse effect  on the traits under study and show that p.K116Q SNP has a negative influence on fecundity traits in Awassi sheep. Based on the findings of this study, it is clear that ewes with the p.K116Q SNP are associated with reduced litter size and  reduced fecundity traits for this population.	0
35211149	Genome-Wide Identification of mRNAs, lncRNAs, and Proteins, and Their Relationship With Sheep Fecundity.	"The exploration of multiple birth-related genes has always been a significant focus in sheep breeding. This study aimed to find more genes and proteins related to the litter size in sheep. Ovarian specimens of Small Tail Han sheep (multiple  births) and Xinji Fine Wool sheep (singleton) were collected during the natural estrus cycle. Transcriptome and proteome of ovarian specimens were analyzed. The  transcriptome results showed that ""steroid hormone biosynthesis"" and ""ovarian steroidogenesis"" were significantly enriched, in which HSD17B1 played an important role. The proteome data also confirmed that the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were enriched in the ovarian steroidogenesis pathway, and the CYP17A1 was the candidate DEP. Furthermore, lncRNA MSTRG.28645 was highly expressed in Small Tailed Han sheep but lowly expressed in Xinji fine wool sheep. In addition, MSTRG.28645, a hub gene in the co-expression network between mRNAs and lncRNAs, was selected as one of the candidate genes for subsequent verification. Expectedly, the overexpression and interference of HSD17B1 and MSTRG.28645 showed a significant effect on hormone secretion in granulosa cells.  Therefore, this study confirmed that HSD17B1 and MSTRG.28645 might be potential genes related to the fecundity of sheep. It was concluded that both HSD17B1 and MSTRG.28645 were critical regulators in the secretion of hormones that affect the fecundity of the sheep."	0
34573664	Detection and Visualization of Heterozygosity-Rich Regions and Runs of Homozygosity in Worldwide Sheep Populations.	In this study, we chose 17 worldwide sheep populations of eight breeds, which were intensively selected for different purposes (meat, milk, or wool), or locally-adapted breeds, in order to identify and characterize factors impacting the detection of runs of homozygosity (ROH) and heterozygosity-rich regions (HRRs) in sheep. We also applied a business intelligence (BI) tool to integrate and visualize outputs from complementary analyses. We observed a prevalence of short ROH, and a clear distinction between the ROH profiles across populations. The visualizations showed a fragmentation of medium and long ROH segments. Furthermore, we tested different scenarios for the detection of HRR and evaluated the impact of the detection parameters used. Our findings suggest that HRRs are small and frequent in the sheep genome; however, further studies with higher density SNP chips and different detection methods are suggested for future research. We also defined ROH and HRR islands and identified common regions across the populations, where genes related to a variety of traits were reported, such as body size, muscle development, and brain functions. These results indicate that such regions are associated with many traits, and thus were under selective pressure in sheep breeds raised for different purposes. Interestingly,  many candidate genes detected within the HRR islands were associated with brain integrity. We also observed a strong association of high linkage disequilibrium pattern with ROH compared with HRR, despite the fact that many regions in linkage disequilibrium were not located in ROH regions.	0
34760910	Ruminal Microbes Exhibit a Robust Circadian Rhythm and Are Sensitive to Melatonin.	Gut hormones are not only able to regulate digestive, absorptive, and immune mechanisms of the intestine through biological rhythms, but impact the host through their interactions with intestinal microorganisms. Whether hormones in ruminal fluid have an association with the ruminal ecology is unknown. Objectives of the study were to examine relationships between the diurnal change in ruminal  hormones and microbiota in lactating cows, and their associations in vivo and in  vitro. For the in vivo study, six cows of similar weight (566.8 ± 19.6 kg), parity (3.0 ± 0.0), and milk performance (8,398.7 ± 1,392.9 kg/y) were used. They were adapted to natural light for 2 weeks before sampling and fed twice daily at  07:00 a.m. and 14:00 p.m. Serum, saliva, and ruminal fluid samples were collected at 02:00, 10:00, and 18:00 on the first day and 06:00, 14:00, and 22:00 on the second day of the experimental period. The concentrations of melatonin (MLT), growth hormone (GH), and prolactin (PRL) were measured via radioimmunoassay, whereas amplicon sequencing data were used to analyze relative abundance of microbiota in ruminal fluid. JTK_CYCLE analysis was performed to analyze circadian rhythms of hormone concentrations as well as the relative abundance of  microbiota. For the in vitro study, exogenous MLT (9 ng) was added into ruminal fluid incubations to investigate the impacts of MLT on ruminal microbiota. The results not only showed that rumen fluid contains MLT, but the diurnal variation  of MLT and the relative abundance of 9% of total rumen bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) follow a circadian rhythm. Although GH and PRL were also detected in ruminal fluid, there was no obvious circadian rhythm in their concentrations. Ruminal MLT was closely associated with Muribaculaceae, Succinivibrionaceae, Veillonellaceae, and Prevotellaceae families in vivo. In vitro, these families were significantly influenced by melatonin treatment, as melatonin treatment increased the relative abundance of families Prevotellaceae,  Muribaculaceae while it reduced the relative abundance of Succinivibrionaceae, Veillonellaceae. Collectively, ruminal microbes appear to maintain a circadian rhythm that is associated with the profiles of melatonin. As such, data suggest that secretion of melatonin into the rumen could play a role in host-microbe interactions in ruminants.	0
34941886	Hepatic transcriptome analysis identifies genes, polymorphisms and pathways involved in the fatty acids metabolism in sheep.	Fatty acids (FA) in ruminants, especially unsaturated FA (USFA) have important impact in meat quality, nutritional value, and flavour quality of meat, and on consumer's health. Identification of the genetic factors controlling the FA composition and metabolism is pivotal to select sheep that produce higher USFA and lower saturated (SFA) for the benefit of sheep industry and consumers. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the transcriptome profiling in the liver tissues collected from sheep with divergent USFA content in longissimus muscle using RNA deep-sequencing. From sheep (n = 100) population, liver tissues  with higher (n = 3) and lower (n = 3) USFA content were analysed using Illumina HiSeq 2500. The total number of reads produced for each liver sample were ranged  from 21.28 to 28.51 million with a median of 23.90 million. Approximately, 198 genes were differentially regulated with significance level of p-adjusted value <0.05. Among them, 100 genes were up-regulated, and 98 were down-regulated (p<0.01, FC>1.5) in the higher USFA group. A large proportion of key genes involved in FA biosynthesis, adipogenesis, fat deposition, and lipid metabolism were identified, such as APOA5, SLC25A30, GFPT1, LEPR, TGFBR2, FABP7, GSTCD, and  CYP17A. Pathway analysis revealed that glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis- keratan sulfate, adipokine signaling, galactose metabolism, endocrine and other factors-regulating calcium metabolism, mineral metabolism, and PPAR signaling pathway were playing important regulatory roles in FA metabolism. Importantly, polymorphism and association analyses showed that mutation in APOA5, CFHR5, TGFBR2 and LEPR genes could be potential markers for the FA composition in sheep. These polymorphisms and transcriptome networks controlling the FA variation could be used as genetic markers for FA composition-related traits improvement. However, functional validation is required to confirm the effect of these SNPs in other sheep population in order to incorporate them in the sheep breeding program.	0
34599210	In silico identification of variations in microRNAs with a potential impact on dairy traits using whole ruminant genome SNP datasets.	MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that have important roles in the lactation process and milk biosynthesis. Some polymorphisms have been studied in various livestock species from the perspective of pathology or production traits. To target variants that could be the causal variants of dairy traits, genetic variants of microRNAs expressed in the mammary gland or present in milk and localized in dairy quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were investigated in bovine, caprine, and ovine species. In this study, a total of 59,124 (out of 28 millions), 13,427 (out of 87 millions), and 4761 (out of 38 millions) genetic variants in microRNAs expressed in the mammary gland or present in milk were identified in bovine, caprine, and ovine species, respectively. A total of 4679 of these detected bovine genetic variants are located in dairy QTLs. In caprine species, 127 genetic variants are localized in dairy QTLs. In ovine species, no genetic variant was identified in dairy QTLs. This study leads to the detection of microRNA genetic variants of interest in the context of dairy production, taking advantage of whole genome data to identify microRNA genetic variants expressed in the mammary gland and localized in dairy QTLs.	0
34658327	Exploration of factors associated with spatial-temporal veterinary surveillance diagnoses of rumen fluke (Calicophoron daubneyi) infections in ruminants using zero-inflated mixed modelling.	Rumen fluke (Calicophoron daubneyi) has emerged as a prominent parasite of ruminants in Europe over the past decades. Epidemiological questions remain regarding this observed increase in prevalence as well as the prospect for future paramphistomosis risk. This study aimed to identify factors associated with the temporal−spatial prevalence of rumen fluke as measured by veterinary surveillance in a temperate region using zero-inflated negative binomial mixed modelling. Modelling revealed that summer rainfall, raindays and sunshine hours and mean winter temperature as significant positively associated climate variables for rumen fluke prevalence over space and time (P < 0.05). Rumen fluke prevalence was also higher in counties with higher cattle/sheep densities and was positively associated with rumen fluke case rates in the previous years (P < 0.05). Equivalent models for fasciolosis prevalence revealed no significant association  with winter temperature and sunshine hours, (P > 0.05). These results confirm a strong association between rainfall and the prevalence of both fluke species in a temperate environment, likely due to the role of Galba truncatula as their intermediate snail host. It also highlights the potential added importance of winter temperature and sunshine hours in rumen fluke epidemiology when compared to liver fluke.	0
34827951	Protein Supplementation and Grazing Behavior for Cows on Differing Late-Season Rangeland Grazing Systems.	The objective was to determine if low- or high-residual feed intake (LRFI or HRFI, n = 24 for each) Hereford × Angus cows on continuously or rotationally grazed rangeland altered their grazing behavior when provided a protein supplement in late autumn. Treatments included continuously grazed, control (CCON, n = 12); continuously grazed, supplemented (CTRT, n = 12); rotationally grazed, control (RCON, n = 12); and rotationally grazed, supplemented pastures (RTRT, n = 12). Cows in each treatment had grazing time (GT), resting time (RT),  and walking time (WLK) measured for 2 years with accelerometers. Bite rate (BR) was also measured. Time distributions of GT and RT differed by year (p < 0.05), being influenced by colder temperatures in 2016. Cattle in 2016 spent more time grazing during early morning and late evening (p < 0.05) and rested more during the day (p < 0.05). In 2017, cattle in the CCON treatment walked more (p < 0.05)  during early morning time periods than did the CTRT cattle, indicative of search  grazing. All supplemented cattle had greater BR (p < 0.05) than control cattle in 2017. Cattle with increased nutritional demands alter grazing behavior in a compensatory fashion when grazing late-season rangelands.	0
34678672	Comparison of ovine β-globin haplotype sequences and a new multiplex PCR for identification.	Deletion of pre-adult βC-globin in sheep harboring BB haplotype of β-globin was associated to decreased tolerance to anemia and hypoxia, and consequently, reduced resistance to Haemonchus contortus infection, which is closely related to severe anemia. Recently, a qPCR using hydrolysis probe was successfully developed for β-globin haplotype identification, and association between resistance against H. contortus and presence of βA allele was observed in Morada Nova sheep. Thus, this study aimed to better investigate the differences between β-globin haplotypes and to develop a conventional multiplex PCR, as an alternative to qPCR assay for β-globin haplotype identification. A total of 333 Morada Nova lambs had their blood collected and tested by both qPCR and new multiplex PCR, and 100 % of agreement was observed between the results. Since different primers were designed for such assay development, including different target genes, high specificity of both methods may be also highlighted. Three A haplotype samples were submitted to DNA Sanger sequencing of β-globin gene and compared to sequences previously deposited in Genbank. One nucleotide deletion in intronic region was observed only in AA haplotype of Morada Nova animals, while in BB animals the nucleotide remained present. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of multiplex conventional PCR for ovine β-globin haplotype identification. The advantages of the developed conventional PCR are reduced reagents costs (less than a half price) and wider reachability, since even labs without real time PCR  thermocyclers are able to offer this assay. Therefore, it may become an important tool for sheep producers to improve genetic selection of parasite resistant animals.	0
35101354	Magnetic Seeds: An Alternative to Wire Localization for Nonpalpable Breast Lesions.	INTRODUCTION: Magnetic seeds have emerged as an alternative to wires for localization of nonpalpable breast lesions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of magnetic seeds compared to wires for preoperative localization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of magnetic seed localization (MSL) and wire localization (WL) excisional biopsies and lumpectomies performed at a single institution was conducted. Indication, age, BMI, number of markers, procedure type, operative time, and postoperative opioid  administration were reviewed. Impact of localization method on operative time, specimen volume, postoperative opioid administration, and re-excision rate were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 608 MSL procedures in 601 patients were compared to 628 WL procedures in 620 patients. MSL excisional biopsies were significantly longer (37.0 minutes) than WL excisional biopsies (31.9 minutes, P< .001), but in lumpectomies without axillary surgery, MSL procedures (42.3 minutes) were significantly shorter than WL procedures (46.9 minutes, P = .017). Significantly  less tissue was excised during MSL lumpectomies (68.5 cm3) and excisional biopsies (32.3 cm3) than WL lumpectomies (78.1 cm3, P = .039) and excisional biopsies (38.7 cm3, P = .018). Postoperative opioid administration was similar for MSL and WL procedures (P = .076). Re-excision rates for MSL lumpectomies were significantly higher for ductal carcinoma in situ (35.3% MSL vs. 18.5% WL, P = .013), but were similar for invasive carcinoma (14.4% MSL vs. 17.7% WL, P = .290). Logistic regression analysis showed no association between localization method and re-excision (OR 1.007, 95% CI 0.681-1.488; P = .973). CONCLUSION: MSL is a feasible alternative to WL for excision of nonpalpable breast lesions with regard to surgical outcomes.	0
35189651	Assessment of Racial Disparities in Aspirin Prophylaxis for Preeclampsia Prevention.	OBJECTIVE:  Low-dose aspirin is recommended for preeclampsia prevention among women with high-risk conditions, including chronic hypertension. Black women have higher rates of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and whether this is related  to disparities in aspirin prophylaxis is unknown. We investigated the relationship between race and counseling/prescription and uptake of aspirin among a cohort of women with chronic hypertension. STUDY DESIGN:  This is a single-institution, retrospective cohort study of women  with chronic hypertension who delivered between 2016 and 2018. Medical record review was performed to assess counseling/prescription of aspirin prophylaxis and self-reported uptake. Self-reported uptake was determined by mention in the provider's notes or by inclusion in the medication reconciliation system. Demographic and obstetric outcome data were compared by self-reported race (Black vs. all other races) in univariate analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between race and aspirin adherence. RESULTS:  We included 872 women: 361 (41.4%) Black women and 511 (58.6%) white or other race women. Overall, 567 (65.0%) women were counseled and/or given a prescription for aspirin, and 411 (72.4%) of those women reported uptake. Black women were equally likely to be counseled and/or prescribed aspirin compared with all other races (67.3 vs. 63.4%; p = 0.7). However, Black women were less likely  to report uptake of aspirin (63.8 vs. 79.0%; p < 0.001). After adjustment for total prenatal visits and tobacco use, Black race was associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.53 (95% confidence interval: 0.36-0.78) for uptake of aspirin. CONCLUSION:  In our cohort, recommendation for aspirin prophylaxis was suboptimal in all groups, reaching only 65% of eligible women. Black women were equally likely as women of other races to receive counseling about aspirin, but rates of  uptake were lower. Our findings suggest that counseling and prescription of aspirin alone in high-risk Black women are not sufficient for utilization of this intervention. KEY POINTS: · Rates of counseling about aspirin prophylaxis for preeclampsia did  not vary by race.. · Black women had lower rates of uptake of aspirin compared with women of other races.. · Counseling about aspirin was inadequate in general, reaching only 65% of eligible women..	0
35194693	Analysis of bluetongue disease epizootics in sheep of Andhra Pradesh, India using spatial and temporal autocorrelation.	Bluetongue (BT) disease poses a constant risk to the livestock population around  the world. A better understanding of the risk factors will enable a more accurate prediction of the place and time of high-risk events. Mapping the disease epizootics over a period in a particular geographic area will identify the spatial distribution of disease occurrence. A Geographical Information System (GIS) based methodology to analyze the relationship between bluetongue epizootics and spatial-temporal patterns was used for the years 2000 to 2015 in sheep of Andhra Pradesh, India. Autocorrelation (ACF), partial autocorrelation (PACF), and cross-correlation (CCF) analyses were carried out to find the self-dependency between BT epizootics and their dependencies on environmental factors and livestock population. The association with climatic or remote sensing variables at different months lag, including wind speed, temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), land surface temperature (LST), was also examined. The ACF &  PACF of BT epizootics with its lag showed a significant positive autocorrelation  with a month's lag (r = 0.41). Cross-correlations between the environmental variables and BT epizootics indicated the significant positive correlations at 0, 1, and 2 month's lag of rainfall, relative humidity, normalized difference water  index (NDWI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Spatial autocorrelation analysis estimated the univariate global Moran's I value of 0.21. Meanwhile, the local Moran's I value for the year 2000 (r = 0.32) showed a high degree of spatial autocorrelation. The spatial autocorrelation analysis revealed  that the BT epizootics in sheep are having considerable spatial association among the outbreaks in nearby districts, and have to be taken care of while making any  forecasting or disease prediction with other risk factors.	0
35216196	Characterization and Interaction Analysis of the Secondary Cell Wall Synthesis-Related Transcription Factor PmMYB7 in Pinus massoniana Lamb.	In vascular plants, the importance of R2R3-myeloblastosis (R2R3-MYB) transcription factors (TFs) in the formation of secondary cell walls (SCWs) has long been a controversial topic due to the lack of empirical evidence of an association between TFs and downstream target genes. Here, we found that the transcription factor PmMYB7, which belongs to the R2R3-MYB subfamily, is involved in lignin biosynthesis in Pinus massoniana. PmMYB7 was highly expressed in lignified tissues and upon abiotic stress. As a bait carrier, the PmMYB7 protein  had no toxicity or autoactivation in the nucleus. Forty-seven proteins were screened from the P. massoniana yeast library. These proteins were predicted to be mainly involved in resistance, abiotic stress, cell wall biosynthesis, and cell development. We found that the PmMYB7 protein interacted with caffeoyl CoA 3-O-methyltransferase-2 (PmCCoAOMT2)-which is involved in lignin biosynthesis-but not with beta-1, 2-xylosyltransferase (PmXYXT1) yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) studies. Our in vivo coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay further showed that the PmMYB7 and PmCCoAOMT2 proteins could interact. Therefore, we concluded that PmMYB7 is an upstream TF that can interact with PmCCoAOMT2 in plant cells. These findings lay  a foundation for further research on the function of PmMYB7, lignin biosynthesis  and molecular breeding in P. massoniana.	0
34500050	Ovine ELOVL5 and FASN genes polymorphisms and their correlations with sheep tail  fat deposition.	Reducing tail fat deposition can increase the economic value of a carcass and improve feed efficiency. This study aimed to explore ELOVL5 and FASN polymorphisms associated with tail fat deposition and their expression levels of  sheep. Association analysis showed that ELOVL5 synonymous mutation g.62534 C > T  was associated with tail width, tail fat weight, and relative tail fat weight (P < 0.05). FASN synonymous mutation g.12694 A > G was associated with tail length and width (P < 0.05). Combined effect analyses indicated significant differences between the combined genotypes and tail fat deposition. Quantitative  real-time reverse transcription PCR indicated that the ELOVL5 and FASN expression levels were significantly higher in tail fat than in other tissues (P < 0.05). ELOVL5 expression levels in tail-fat tissue of big-tail sheep was significantly higher than that in small-tail sheep (P < 0.01). FASN expression levels were significantly higher in tail-fat tissue of small-tail sheep than in that of big-tail sheep (P < 0.05). During development, ELOVL5 tail fat expression increased significantly from 0 to 6 months old (P < 0.05), and FASN expression at 3 months old was significantly higher than that at 0 (minimum) and 6 months old (P < 0.05). Therefore, ELOVL5 and FASN polymorphisms could represent new candidate molecular markers and targets to reduce tail fat deposition in sheep.	0
34868196	Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantification-Based Proteomics Reveals Candidate Proteins of Fat Deposition in Chinese Indigenous Sheep With Morphologically Different Tails.	Background: Chinese indigenous sheep can be classified into two types according to their tail morphology: fat-rumped and thin-tailed sheep, of which the typical  breeds are Altay sheep and Tibetan sheep, respectively. Methods: To identify the  differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) underlying the phenotypic differences between tail types, we used isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) combined with multi-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technology to detect candidate proteins. We then subjected these to a database search and identified the DEPs. Finally, bioinformatics technology was used to carry out Gene Ontology (GO) functional and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses. Results: A total of 3,248 proteins were identified, of which 44 were up-regulated and 40 were down-regulated DEPs. Analyzing their GO function terms and KEGG pathways revealed that the functions of these DEPs are mainly binding, catalytic activity, structural molecule activity, molecular function regulator, and transporter activity. Among the genes encoding the DEPs, APOA2, GALK1, ADIPOQ, and NDUFS4 are associated with fat formation and metabolism. Conclusion: The APOA2, GALK1, ADIPOQ, and NDUFS4 genes may be involved in the deposition of fat in the tail of  sheep. This study provides a scientific basis for the breeding of thin-tailed sheep.	0
34472112	Trends towards revealing the genetic architecture of sheep tail patterning: Promising genes and investigatory pathways.	Different sheep breeds have evolved after initial domestication, generating various tail phenotypic patterns. The phenotypic diversity of sheep tail patterns offers ideal materials for comparative analysis of its genetic basis. Evolutionary biologists, animal geneticists, breeders, and producers have been curious to clearly understand the underlying genetics behind phenotypic differences in sheep tails. Understanding the causal gene(s) and mutation(s) underlying these differences will help probe an evolutionary riddle, improve animal production performance, promote animal welfare, and provide lessons that help comprehend human diseases related to fat deposition (i.e., obesity). Historically, fat tails have served as an adaptive response to aridification and  climate change. However, the fat tail is currently associated with compromised mating and animal locomotion, fat distribution in the animal body, increased raising costs, reduced consumer preference, and other animal welfare issues such  as tail docking. The developing genomic approaches provide unprecedented opportunities to determine causal variants underlying phenotypic differences among populations. In the last decade, researchers have performed several genomic investigations to assess the genomic causality underlying phenotypic variations in sheep tails. Various genes have been suggested with the prominence of several  potentially significant causatives, including the BMP2 and PDGFD genes associated with the fat tail phenotype and the TBXT gene linked with the caudal vertebrae number and tail length. Although the potential genes related to sheep tail characteristics have been revealed, the causal variant(s) and mutation(s) of these high-ranking candidate genes are still elusive and need further investigation. The review discusses the potential genes, sheds light on a knowledge gap, and provides possible investigative approaches that could help determine the specific genomic causatives of sheep tail patterns. Besides, characterizing and revealing the genetic determinism of sheep tails will help solve issues compromising sheep breeding and welfare in the future.	0
35228133	Association analysis between novel variants in LEPR gene and litter size in Mongolia and ujimqin sheep breeds.	Prolificacy is an important trait of livestock, especially for species with multiple births, such as sheep. The leptin receptor (LEPR) is considered as a major candidate gene that affects the reproductive traits of sheep. The known R62H mutation in the LEPR gene is associated with the hyperprolific phenotype of  Davisdale sheep. However, studies identifying novel variations and seeking breed-specific markers associated with litter size in other sheep breeds are rare. In this study, we sequenced all coding regions of the LEPR gene of Mongolia sheep, and nine novel variants of the LEPR gene were detected by direct sequencing. Among them, the synonymous c.240C > T and c.279C > T mutations were significantly associated with the litter sizes of Mongolia ewes (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively) and Ujimqin ewes (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). The silent c.240C > T and c.279C > T mutations are predicted to change the stability of the mRNA secondary structure by reducing the minimum free energy and are predicted to change the mRNA secondary structure of LEPR. Our findings may provide potentially useful genetic markers for increasing litter size in sheep.	0
35360858	Variants Within Genes EDIL3 and ADGRB3 are Associated With Divergent Fecal Egg Counts in Katahdin Sheep at Weaning.	Gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) pose a severe threat to sheep production worldwide. Anthelmintic drug resistance coupled with growing concern regarding potential environmental effects of drug use have demonstrated the necessity of implementing other methods of GIN control. The aim of this study was to test for  genetic variants associated with resistance or susceptibility to GIN in Katahdin  sheep to improve the current understanding of the genetic mechanisms responsible  for host response to GIN. Linear regression and case-control genome-wide association studies were conducted with high-density genotype data and cube-root  transformed weaning fecal egg counts (tFEC) of 583 Katahdin sheep. The case-control GWAS identified two significant SNPs (P-values 1.49e-08 to 1.01e-08) within introns of the gene adhesion G protein-coupled receptor B3 (ADGRB3) associated with lower fecal egg counts. With linear regression, four significant  SNPs (P-values 7.82e-08 to 3.34e-08) were identified within the first intron of the gene EGF-like repeats and discoidin domains 3 (EDIL3). These identified SNPs  were in very high linkage disequilibrium (r 2 of 0.996-1), and animals with alternate homozygous genotypes had significantly higher median weaning tFEC phenotypes compared to all other genotypes. Significant SNPs were queried through public databases to identify putative transcription factor binding site (TFBS) and potential lncRNA differences between reference and alternate alleles. Changes in TFBS were predicted at two SNPs, and one significant SNP was found to be within a predicted lncRNA sequence with greater than 90% similarity to a known lncRNA in the bovine genome. The gene EDIL3 has been described in other species for its roles in the inhibition and resolution of inflammation. Potential changes of EDIL3 expression mediated through lncRNA expression and/or transcription factor binding may impact the overall immune response and reduce the ability of Katahdin sheep to control GIN infection. This study lays the foundation for further research of EDIL3 and ADGRB3 towards understanding genetic mechanisms of  susceptibility to GIN, and suggests these SNPs may contribute to genetic strategies for improving parasite resistance traits in sheep.	0
34882990	Association of Ovar-DRB1 alleles with innate immune responses in sheep.	BACKGROUND: Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is the best characterised genetic region associated with adaptive immune responses, including humoral and cell-mediated immunities. OBJECTIVES: In this study, the association of MHC class II alleles with inflammatory cytokines and acute-phase proteins was evaluated in sheep population. METHODS: Allelic diversity of second exon of ovine DRB1 locus (Ovar-DRB1.2) was determined in 100 indigenous Iranian Lori-Bakhtiari fat-tailed sheep using restriction fragment length polymorphism and direct sequencing methods. The association of DRB1.2 alleles with inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β, IL-1β; IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor-α) and acute-phase proteins (serum amyloid A, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein and haptoglobin) was examined using generalised linear  model and multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: Seven distinct RsaI restriction patterns and fourteen alleles were identified in this population. Allele DRB1*2101 showed a negative influence on the IL-6 response and was associated with lower serum level of IL-6. DRB1.2 heterozygous individuals also showed higher haptoglobin concentration than homozygotes. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide additional support for the association between Ovar-DRB1 alleles and regulation of immune responses in sheep population. Description of MHC polymorphism and its role in the controlling of immune responses will increase our understanding of host-pathogen interactions, and ultimately facilitate the selection of disease-resistant flocks in genetic breeding programs.	0
35223538	Natural History and Ecology of Interactions Between Bordetella Species and Amoeba.	A variety of bacteria have evolved the ability to interact with environmental phagocytic predators such as amoebae, which may have facilitated their subsequent interactions with phagocytes in animal hosts. Our recent study found that the animal pathogen Bordetella bronchiseptica can evade predation by the common soil  amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, survive within, and hijack its complex life cycle as a propagation and dissemination vector. However, it is uncertain whether the mechanisms allowing interactions with predatory amoebae are conserved among Bordetella species, because divergence, evolution, and adaptation to different hosts and ecological niches was accompanied by acquisition and loss of many genes. Here we tested 9 diverse Bordetella species in three assays representing distinct aspects of their interactions with D. discoideum. Several human and animal pathogens retained the abilities to survive within single-celled amoeba, to inhibit amoebic plaque expansion, and to translocate with amoebae to the fruiting body and disseminate along with the fruiting body. In contrast, these abilities were partly degraded for the bird pathogen B. avium, and for the human-restricted species B. pertussis and B. parapertussis. Interestingly, a different lineage of B. parapertussis only known to infect sheep retained the ability to interact with D. discoideum, demonstrating that these abilities were lost in multiple lineages independently, correlating with niche specialization and recent rapid genome decay apparently mediated by insertion sequences. B. petrii has been isolated sporadically from diverse human and environmental sources, has acquired insertion sequences, undergone genome decay and has also lost the ability to interact with amoebae, suggesting some specialization to some unknown niche. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a set of genes that are potentially associated with the ability to interact with D. discoideum.  These results suggest that massive gene loss associated with specialization of some Bordetella species to a closed life cycle in a particular host was repeatedly and independently accompanied by loss of the ability to interact with  amoebae in an environmental niche.	0
34394196	Genes and Pathways Affecting Sheep Productivity Traits: Genetic Parameters, Genome-Wide Association Mapping, and Pathway Enrichment Analysis.	Ewe productivity is a composite and maternal trait that is considered the most important economic trait in sheep meat production. The objective of this study was the application of alternative genome-wide association study (GWAS) approaches followed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on the ewes' genome to identify genes affecting pregnancy outcomes and lamb growth after parturition in  Iranian Baluchi sheep. Three maternal composite traits at birth and weaning were  considered. The traits were progeny birth weight, litter mean weight at birth, total litter weight at birth, progeny weaning weight, litter mean weight at weaning, and total litter weight at weaning. GWASs were performed on original phenotypes as well as on estimated breeding values. The significant SNPs associated with composite traits at birth were located within or near genes RDX,  FDX1, ARHGAP20, ZC3H12C, THBS1, and EPG5. Identified genes and pathways have functions related to pregnancy, such as autophagy in the placenta, progesterone production by the placenta, placental formation, calcium ion transport, and maternal immune response. For composite traits at weaning, genes (NR2C1, VEZT, HSD17B4, RSU1, CUBN, VIM, PRLR, and FTH1) and pathways affecting feed intake and  food conservation, development of mammary glands cytoskeleton structure, and production of milk components like fatty acids, proteins, and vitamin B-12, were  identified. The results show that calcium ion transport during pregnancy and feeding lambs by milk after parturition can have the greatest impact on weight gain as compared to other effects of maternal origin.	0
34529728	Genetic differentiation of mainland-island sheep of Greece: Implications for identifying candidate genes for long-term local adaptation.	In Greece, a number of local sheep breeds are raised in a wide range of ecological niches across the country. These breeds can be used for the identification of genetic variants that contribute to local adaptation. To this end, 50k genotypes of 90 local sheep from mainland Greece (Epirus, n = 35 and Peloponnesus, n = 55) were used, as well as 147 genotypes of sheep from insular Greece (Skyros, n = 21), Lemnos, n = 36 and Lesvos, n = 90). Principal components and phylogenetic analysis along with admixture and spatial point patterns analyses suggested genetic differentiation of 'mainland-island' populations. Genome scans for signatures of selection and genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) pointed to one highly differentiating marker on OAR4 (FST = 0.39, FLK = 21.93, FDR p-value = 0.10) that also displayed genome wide significance (FDR p-value = 0.002) during GWAS. A total number of 6 positional candidate genes (LOC106990429, ZNF804B, TEX47, STEAP4, SRI and ADAM22) were identified within 500 kb flanking regions around the significant marker. In addition, two QTLs related  to fat tail deposition are reported in genomic regions 800 kb downstream the significant marker. Based on gene ontology analysis and literature evidence, the  identified candidate genes possess biological functions relevant to local adaptation that worth further investigation.	0
35304498	Analysis tools for single-monomer measurements of self-assembly processes.	Protein assembly plays an important role throughout all phyla of life, both physiologically and pathologically. In particular, aggregation and polymerization of proteins are key-strategies that regulate cellular function. In recent years,  methods to experimentally study the assembly process on a single-molecule level have been developed. This progress concomitantly has triggered the question of how to analyze this type of single-filament data adequately and what experimental conditions are necessary to allow a meaningful interpretation of the analysis. Here, we developed two analysis methods for single-filament data: the visitation  analysis and the average-rate analysis. We benchmarked and compared both approaches with the classic dwell-time-analysis frequently used to study microscopic association and dissociation rates. In particular, we tested the limitations of each analysis method along the lines of the signal-to-noise ratio, the sampling rate, and the labeling efficiency and bleaching rate of the fluorescent dyes used in single-molecule fluorescence experiments. Finally, we applied our newly developed methods to study the monomer assembly of actin at the single-molecule-level in the presence of the class II nucleator Cappuccino and the WH2 repeats of Spire. For Cappuccino, our data indicated fast elongation circumventing a nucleation phase whereas, for Spire, we found that the four WH2 motifs are not sufficient to promote de novo nucleation of actin.	0
34787782	Long COVID and COVID-19-associated cystitis (CAC).	PURPOSE: There is scarce literature regarding genitourinary symptoms in COVID-19, especially post-acute disease otherwise known as Long COVID. We identified recovered COVID-19 patients presenting with new or worsening overactive bladder symptoms, known as COVID-19-associated cystitis (CAC). METHODS: We used the American Urological Association Urology Care Foundation Overactive Bladder (OAB) Assessment Tool to screen COVID-19 recovered patients presenting with urological complaints at our urban-located institution from 5/22/2020 to 12/31/2020. Patients 10-14 weeks post-discharge responded to 5 symptom and 4 quality-of-life (QoL) questions. We reported median symptom scores, as well as QoL scores, based on new or worsening urinary symptoms, and by sex. RESULTS: We identified 350 patients with de novo or worsening OAB symptoms 10-14 weeks after hospitalization with COVID-19. The median total OAB symptom score in both men and women was 18. The median total QoL score for both men and women was 19. Patients with worsening OAB symptoms had a median pre-COVID-19 symptom score of 8 (4-10) compared to post-COVID-19 median symptom score of 19 (17-21). Median age was 64.5 (range 47-82). Median hospital length-of-stay was 10 days (range 5-30). CONCLUSION: We report survey-based results of patients suffering from new or worsening OAB symptoms months after their hospitalization from COVID-19. Future studies with larger sample sizes and more extensive testing will hopefully elucidate the specific pathophysiology of OAB symptoms in the context of long COVID so urologists can timely and appropriately treat their patients.	0
34964680	Nonverbal Emotions While Disclosing Child Abuse: The Role of Interviewer Support.	Statements by alleged victims are important when child abuse is prosecuted; triers-of-fact often attend to nonverbal emotional expressions when evaluating those statements. This study examined the associations among interviewer supportiveness, children's nonverbal emotions, and informativeness during 100 forensic interviews with alleged victims of child abuse. Raters coded the silent  videotapes for children's nonverbal emotional expressions while other raters coded the transcripts for interviewer support, children's verbal emotions, and informativeness. Results showed that children's nonverbal signals were more common than and preceded the verbal signs. Interviewer support was associated with children's expressivity. When children expressed more nonverbal emotions, they were more responsive during the pre-substantive phases and more informative  about the abuse. Nonverbal emotions partially mediated the association between support and informativeness. The findings underline the value of nonverbal emotional expression during forensic interviews and demonstrate how the interviewers' supportive demeanor can facilitate children's emotional displays and increase informativeness.	0
34797700	Detecting Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in MEF2B and UCP3 and Elucidating Their Association with Sheep Growth Traits.	Herein we detected single nucleotide polymorphisms in MEF2B and UCP3 by DNA sequencing and the KASPar technology and analyzed their association with sheep growth traits. Two synonymous mutations, g.1826 C > T and g.10266 G > C, were detected, respectively, and they were found to be significantly associated with sheep growth traits (p < 0.05). In case of MEF2B g.1826 C > T, the average body weight and chest and cannon circumference of sheep with the CC genotype were significantly higher than those of sheep with the CT and TT genotypes (p < 0.05). Moreover, in case of UCP3 g.10266 G > C, the average body weight and chest and cannon circumference of sheep with the GG genotype were significantly higher than those of sheep with the GC and CC genotypes (p < 0.05). Moreover, the average body weight of sheep with the CC/GG genotype was higher compared with those of other genotype combinations. We also assessed MEF2B and UCP3 expression in different sheep tissues, confirming their expression in all examined tissues. To  summarize, we believe that the polymorphisms identified in MEF2B and UCP3 can serve as molecular markers for sheep growth traits.	0
35317671	Ewe are what ewe wear: bigger horns, better ewes and the potential consequence of trophy hunting on female fitness in bighorn sheep.	In polygynous species, secondary sexual traits such as weapons or elaborate ornaments have evolved through intrasexual competition for mates. In some species, these traits are present in both sexes but are underdeveloped in the sex facing lower intrasexual competition for mates. It is often assumed that these underdeveloped sexually selected traits are a vestige of strong sexual selection  on the other sex. Here, we challenge this assumption and investigate whether the  expression of secondary sexual traits is associated with fitness in female bighorn sheep. Analyses of 45 years of data revealed that female horn length at 2 years, while accounting for mass and environmental variables, is associated with  younger age at primiparity, younger age of first offspring weaned, greater reproductive lifespan and higher lifetime reproductive success. There was no association between horn length and fecundity. These findings highlight a potential conservation issue. In this population, trophy hunting selects against  males with fast-growing horns. Intersexual genetic correlations imply that intense selective hunting of large-horned males before they can reproduce can decrease female horn size. Therefore, intense trophy hunting of males based on horn size could reduce female reproductive performance through the associations identified here, and ultimately reduce population growth and viability.	0
34850658	Animal safety of a tall fescue endophyte (Epichloë sp.) in a perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) host.	AIMS: To assess animal health and production in sheep grazing perennial ryegrass  (Lolium perenne) infected with a tall fescue endophyte (Epichloë sp.). METHODS: Three replicates of pure perennial ryegrass pastures infected with AR501 tall fescue endophyte (AR501 HE), AR1, AR37 or standard endophyte (STD) (all >85% infection) and a low endophyte control (AR501 LE) were grazed by 10 lambs for 7 weeks during late summer/early autumn, 2017. AR501 HE and AR501 LE were in the same tetraploid cultivar and the remaining treatments were in the same diploid cultivar. Lambs were weighed on Days 0, 19, 37 and 48 and assessed for ryegrass staggers on a 0-4 tremor scale nine times from Day 13. On Days 14 and 20, rectal  temperatures and respiration rates were measured in lambs grazing AR501 HE, AR501 LE and STD under heat load. Pasture samples from each treatment were taken regularly (8 times) for analysis of known endophyte secondary metabolites. RESULTS: Peak mean ryegrass staggers scores for lambs grazing STD and AR37 treatments were 3.9 and 2.7, respectively, indicating environmental conditions were conducive to toxicity. Lambs grazing AR501 HE showed no ryegrass staggers at any date. The liveweight of STD lambs was up to 6.6 kg less than some or all other treatments on Days 19, 34 and 48, but there was no evidence of a difference between the liveweight of AR501 HE lambs and AR501 LE, AR37 or AR1 lambs on any date. Rectal temperatures and respiration rates of STD lambs were higher than AR501 HE lambs by 0.2°C and 26 breaths/minute, respectively. Apart from lower rectal temperature of AR501 HE lambs on Day 14, there was no evidence of differences between the AR501 HE and AR501 LE lambs. N-Formylloline was the only  loline present in AR501 HE herbage (350-860 mg/kg). Peramine in AR501 HE herbage  (42-77 mg/kg) was greater than that in STD and AR1 herbage on five and seven of the eight sampling dates, respectively. CONCLUSION: Lambs grazing AR501 HE showed no ryegrass staggers, exacerbated heat  stress or suppressed liveweight gain compared with lambs grazing AR501 LE in a season when endophyte-induced toxicity was evident in STD and AR37 pastures. This suggests AR501 tall fescue endophyte does not produce toxic concentrations of secondary metabolites. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study suggests that there are no secondary metabolites produced by the tall fescue AR501 endophyte-perennial ryegrass association which  affect animal health or production.	0
34887487	FASN, SCD1 and ANXA9 gene polymorphism as genetic predictors of the fatty acid profile of sheep milk.	In this study, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ANXA9 (annexin 9), FASN (fatty acid synthase) and SCD1 (stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1) genes were analyzed as factors influencing fatty acid profiles in milk from Zošľachtená valaška sheep. SNP in selected genes was identified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The long-chain fatty acids profile in sheep milk was identified by gas chromatography. Statistical analysis of the SCD1/Cfr13I polymorphism showed that  the milk of the homozygous AA animals was characterized by a lower (P < 0.05) share of C4:0, C6:0, C8:0, C10:0, C12:0, C14:0 in comparison to the homozygous CC sheep. The milk of heterozygous sheep was characterized by a higher (P < 0.05) proportion of C13:0 acid compared to the milk of sheep with the homozygous AA type. A higher (P < 0.05) level of saturated fatty acids (SFA) was found in the milk of CC genotype sheep compared to the AA genotype. Our results lead to the conclusion that the greatest changes were observed for the SCD1/Cfr13I polymorphism and the least significant ones for FASN/AciI. Moreover, it is the first evidence that milk from sheep with SCD1/Cfr13I polymorphism and the homozygous AA genotype showed the most desirable fatty acids profile.	0
34981017	Using the PCR and Blood Agar in Diagnosis of Semen Bacterial Contamination of Fertile and Infertile Men.	BACKGROUND: One of the causes of male infertility is Genital tract infections (GTI). Considering the importance of GTI, widespread recognition of them seems necessary. we aimed to characterize and compare semen microbial populations in fertile and infertile men who referred to an infertility clinic in Yazd, Iran. METHODS: Semen samples were collected from two groups of fertile (268) and infertile (210) men. Sperm analysis (concentration, morphology, viability and motility parameters) were performed according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2010 guidelines laboratory manual. Bacterial isolation was performed in Sheep Blood Agar and Eosin Methylene Blue (EMB) agar plates. For PCR, samples were analyzed with genus specific primers. RESULTS: All semen characteristics were poor in the infertile group compared to those in the fertile men (p-value< 0.05). Enterococcus spp. (18.7%, 17.1%; p= 0.814), E. coli (7.9%, 11.4%; p= 0.486), Staphylococcus aureus (6.4%, 2.9%; p= 0.398) and Proteus mirabilis (0%, 2.9%; p= 0.002) were the most common agents, respectively. Also, the results obtained from PCR were confirmed using culture-base method. CONCLUSION: Proteus mirabilis contamination was identified in the infertile group. While no significant association was observed between male infertility and semen microbial populations, p. mirabilis may be the leading cause of reproduction impairment in men.	0
35177770	The Antarctic Weddell seal genome reveals evidence of selection on cardiovascular phenotype and lipid handling.	The Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii) thrives in its extreme Antarctic environment. We generated the Weddell seal genome assembly and a high-quality annotation to investigate genome-wide evolutionary pressures that underlie its phenotype and to study genes implicated in hypoxia tolerance and a lipid-based metabolism. Genome-wide analyses included gene family expansion/contraction, positive selection, and diverged sequence (acceleration) compared to other placental mammals, identifying selection in coding and non-coding sequence in five pathways that may shape cardiovascular phenotype. Lipid metabolism as well as hypoxia genes contained more accelerated regions in the Weddell seal compared  to genomic background. Top-significant genes were SUMO2 and EP300; both regulate  hypoxia inducible factor signaling. Liver expression of four genes with the strongest acceleration signals differ between Weddell seals and a terrestrial mammal, sheep. We also report a high-density lipoprotein-like particle in Weddell seal serum not present in other mammals, including the shallow-diving harbor seal.	0
34440417	Genome-Wide Analysis for Early Growth-Related Traits of the Locally Adapted Egyptian Barki Sheep.	Sheep play a critical role in the agricultural and livestock sector in Egypt. For sheep meat production, growth traits such as birth and weaning weights are very important and determine the supply and income of local farmers. The Barki sheep originates from the northeastern coastal zone of Africa, and due to its good adaptation to the harsh environmental conditions, it contributes significantly to the meat production in these semi-arid regions. This study aimed to use a genome-wide SNP panel to identify genomic regions that are diversified between groups of individuals of Egyptian Barki sheep with high and low growth performance traits. In this context, from a phenotyped population of 140 lambs of Barki sheep, 69 lambs were considered for a genome-wide scan with the Illumina OvineSNP50 V2 BeadChip. The selected lambs were grouped into divergent subsets with significantly different performance for birth weight and weaning weight. After quality control, 63 animals and 40,383 SNPs were used for analysis. The fixation index (FST) for each SNP was calculated between the groups. The results  verified genomic regions harboring some previously proposed candidate genes for traits related to body growth, i.e., EYA2, GDF2, GDF10, MEF2B, SLC16A7, TBX15, TFAP2B, and TNNC2. Moreover, novel candidate genes were proposed with known functional implications on growth processes such as CPXM2 and LRIG3. Subsequent association analysis showed significant effects of the considered SNPs on birth and weaning weights. Results highlight the genetic diversity associated with performance traits and thus the potential to improve growth traits in the Barki sheep breed.	0
34760406	Integrative analysis of Iso-Seq and RNA-seq data reveals transcriptome complexity and differentially expressed transcripts in sheep tail fat.	BACKGROUND: Nowadays, both customers and producers prefer thin-tailed fat sheep.  To effectively breed for this phenotype, it is important to identify candidate genes and uncover the genetic mechanism related to tail fat deposition in sheep.  Accumulating evidence suggesting that post-transcriptional modification events of precursor-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA), including alternative splicing (AS) and alternative polyadenylation (APA), may regulate tail fat deposition in sheep. Differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) analysis is a way to identify candidate genes related to tail fat deposition. However, due to the technological limitation, post-transcriptional modification events in the tail fat of sheep and DETs between thin-tailed and fat-tailed sheep remains unclear. METHODS: In the present study, we applied pooled PacBio isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) to generate transcriptomic data of tail fat tissue from six sheep (three thin-tailed sheep and three fat-tailed sheep). By comparing with reference genome, potential gene loci and novel transcripts were identified. Post-transcriptional modification events, including AS and APA, and lncRNA in sheep tail fat were uncovered using pooled Iso-Seq data. Combining Iso-Seq data with six RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) data, DETs between thin- and fat-tailed sheep were identified. Protein protein interaction (PPI) network, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were implemented to investigate the potential functions of DETs. RESULTS: In the present study, we revealed the transcriptomic complexity of the tail fat of sheep, result in 9,001 potential novel gene loci, 17,834 AS events, 5,791 APA events, and 3,764 lncRNAs. Combining Iso-Seq data with RNA-Seq data, we identified hundreds of DETs between thin- and fat-tailed sheep. Among them, 21 differentially expressed lncRNAs, such as ENSOART00020036299, ENSOART00020033641, ENSOART00020024562, ENSOART00020003848 and 9.53.1 may regulate tail fat deposition. Many novel transcripts were identified as DETs, including 15.527.13 (DGAT2), 13.624.23 (ACSS2), 11.689.28 (ACLY), 11.689.18 (ACLY), 11.689.14 (ACLY), 11.660.12 (ACLY), 22.289.6 (SCD), 22.289.3 (SCD) and 22.289.14 (SCD). Most of the identified DETs have been enriched in GO and KEGG pathways related to extracellular matrix (ECM). Our result revealed the transcriptome complexity and  identified many candidate transcripts in tail fat, which could enhance the understanding of molecular mechanisms behind tail fat deposition.	0
34823870	Plasma homoarginine concentrations in ewe's pregnancy and association with the number of fetuses.	A striking increase in homoarginine concentrations, about more than 100-fold that observed in humans, was recently reported during pregnancy in a nutritionally induced model of intra-uterine growth restriction in ewes. To determine whether this phenomenon is at least partially related to the nutritional regimen, estrus  synchronization, or analytical method, thirty-four one-year-old primiparous, non-synchronized, and well-fed Sarda breed ewes were exposed to fertile rams allowing those who came into estrus to naturally mate. Plasma arginine, homoarginine, asymmetric dimethylarginine, symmetric dimethylarginine, mono methylarginine, and citrulline concentrations were measured in each sample using  LC-MS/MS. Homoarginine concentrations showed a 44-fold variation between the highest and the lowest values while the fluctuations of arginine and its analogues and metabolites were much smaller, between 1.1 and 1.6-fold. Repeated-measures correlation analysis showed a significant negative correlation  between homoarginine/arginine and arginine/asymmetric dimethylarginine ratios (Rm = -0.40; P < 0.000001). Furthermore, median homoarginine concentrations significantly increased with the number of fetuses. The marked increase in homoarginine concentrations with advancing gestational age is genuine and independent of mating, feeding, diet, and hormone treatment. The higher homoarginine concentrations found in ewes bearing multiple fetuses suggest the presence of a physiological link between this arginine analog and energy metabolism in pregnancy that warrants further investigation.	0
35332049	Novel predictive role for mid-regional proadrenomedullin in moderate to severe aortic stenosis.	OBJECTIVE: We investigated the prognostic significance of selected known and novel circulating biomarkers in aortic stenosis (AS). METHODS: N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP), high-sensitivity troponin-T (hsTnT), growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), suppression of tumorigenicity-2 (ST2), mid-regional proadrenomedullin (MR-proADM) and mid-regional proatrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) were measured in patients with moderate to severe AS, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I-II and left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50%, recruited consecutively across five centres from 2011 to 2018. Their ability to predict both primary (all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalisation or progression to NYHA class III-IV) and secondary (additionally  incorporating syncope and acute coronary syndrome) outcomes was determined by competing risk analyses. RESULTS: Among 173 patients with AS (age 69±11 years, 55% male, peak transaortic  velocity (Vmax) 4.0±0.8 m/s), the primary and secondary outcomes occurred in 59 (34%) and 66 (38%), respectively. With aortic valve replacement as a competing risk, the primary outcome was determined consistently by the comorbidity index and each selected biomarker except ST2 (p<0.05), independent of NYHA class, Vmax, LV-global longitudinal strain and serum creatinine. MR-proADM had the highest discriminative value for both primary (subdistribution HR (SHR) 11.3, 95% CI 3.9  to 32.7) and secondary outcomes (SHR 12.6, 95% CI 4.7 to 33.5). Prognostic assessment of dual-biomarker combinations identified MR-proADM plus either hsTnT  or NT-proBNP as the best predictive model for both clinical outcomes. Paired biomarker models were not superior to those including MR-proADM as the sole circulating biomarker. CONCLUSION: MR-proADM most powerfully portended worse prognosis and should be further assessed as possibly the biomarker of choice for risk stratification in AS.	0
35336723	Non-Coding Transcriptome Provides Novel Insights into the Escherichia coli F17 Susceptibility of Sheep Lamb.	It has long been recognized that enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is the major pathogen responsible for vomiting and diarrhea. E. coli F17, a main subtype of ETEC, is characterized by high morbidity and mortality in young livestock. However, the transcriptomic basis underlying E. coli F17 infection has not been fully understood. In this study, RNA sequencing was performed to explore the expression profiles of circRNAs and miRNAs in the jejunum of E. coli F17-antagonism (AN) and -sensitive (SE) lambs. A total of 16,534 circRNAs and 271 miRNAs (125 novel miRNAs and 146 annotated miRNAs) were screened, and 214 differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs and 53 DE miRNAs were detected between the AN and SE lambs (i.e., novel_circ_0025840, novel_circ_0022779, novel_miR_107, miR-10b). Functional enrichment analyses showed that source genes of DE circRNAs  were mainly involved in metabolic-related pathways, while target genes of DE miRNAs were mainly enriched in the immune response pathways. Then, a two-step machine learning approach combining Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost (candidates were first selected by RF and further assessed by XGBoost) was performed, which identified 44 circRNAs and 39 miRNAs as potential biomarkers (i.e., novel_circ_0000180, novel_circ_0000365, novel_miR_192, oar-miR-496-3p) for E. coli infection. Furthermore, circRNA-related and lncRNA-related ceRNA networks were constructed, containing 46 circRNA-miRNA-mRNA competing triplets and 630 lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA competing triplets, respectively. By conducting a serious of bioinformatic analyses, our results revealed important circRNAs and miRNAs that could be potentially developed as candidate biomarkers for intestinal inflammatory response against E. coli F17 infection; our study can provide novel  insights into the underlying mechanisms of intestinal immunity.	0
34904916	Genome sequence of Dichelobacter nodosus JKS-07B isolate from J&K, India associated with virulent footrot of sheep.	INTRODUCTION: Virulent footrot of sheep caused by Dichelobacter nodosus is associated with tremendous economic losses due to recurrent treatment costs and increased culling rates. This organism being a fastidious anaerobe is difficult to isolate on ordinary media that does not support its growth. The D. nodosus serogroup B isolate described in the present study has been used in the preparation of the whole-cell killed vaccine against footrot in India. D. nodosus serogroup B is the predominant serogroup involved in virulent footrot (lesion score 4) in India as well as in many sheep-rearing countries of the globe. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted using wizard Genomic DNA purification kit. The whole genome of the D. nodosus strain B was sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform and annotated according to functional gene categories. Annotations  were performed using in-house developed Perl scripts using Nr/Nt database, uniprot, Pfam, KEGG, Panther DB, and GO database. RESULT: The assembled genome size is 1.311,533 Mb and GC content is 44.38. A total of 1215 protein-coding genes, 44tRNA and 7 rRNA were identified. The genome shows 98.63% sequence homology with the reference genome. However, 21 new genes have been identified in this genome. The information will provide insights into the various genes and regulators necessary for D. nodosus growth and survival. DISCUSSION: The genome information of this serogroup B of D. nodosus isolate involved in 85-90% cases of virulent footrot of sheep in India provides further insights for improvement of the killed vaccine (B serogroup) developed recently in India. For the development of an efficacious vaccine against virulent footrot, it is essential to know the serological diversity as well as the virulent status  of the strains of the D. nodosus. This serogroup isolate is a potential vaccine candidate to mitigate ovine footrot in India as the majority of virulent footrot  cases belong to serogroup B of D. nodosus.	0
34533033	Acute Decompensated Heart Failure and the Kidney: Physiological, Histological and Transcriptomic Responses to Development and Recovery.	BACKGROUND Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is associated with deterioration in renal function-an important risk factor for poor outcomes. Whether ADHF results in permanent kidney damage/dysfunction is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS We investigated for the first time the renal responses to the development of, and recovery from, ADHF using an ovine model. ADHF development induced pronounced hemodynamic changes, neurohormonal activation, and decline in  renal function, including decreased urine, sodium and urea excretion, and creatinine clearance. Following ADHF recovery (25 days), creatinine clearance reductions persisted. Kidney biopsies taken during ADHF and following recovery showed widespread mesangial cell prominence, early mild acute tubular injury, and medullary/interstitial fibrosis. Renal transcriptomes identified altered expression of 270 genes following ADHF development and 631 genes following recovery. A total of 47 genes remained altered post-recovery. Pathway analysis suggested gene expression changes, driven by a network of inflammatory cytokines  centered on IL-1β (interleukin 1β), lead to repression of reno-protective eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase) signaling during ADHF development, and following recovery, activation of glomerulosclerosis and reno-protective pathways and repression of proinflammatory/fibrotic pathways. A total of 31 dysregulated genes encoding proteins detectable in urine, serum, and plasma identified potential candidate markers for kidney repair (including CNGA3 [cyclic nucleotide gated channel subunit alpha 3] and OIT3 [oncoprotein induced transcript 3]) or long-term renal impairment in ADHF (including ACTG2 [actin gamma 2, smooth muscle] and ANGPTL4 [angiopoietin like 4]). CONCLUSIONS In an ovine model, we provide the first direct evidence that an episode of ADHF leads to an immediate decline in kidney function that failed to fully resolve after ≈4 weeks and is associated with persistent functional/structural kidney injury. We identified molecular pathways underlying kidney injury and repair in ADHF and highlighted 31 novel candidate biomarkers for acute kidney injury in this setting.	0
35052387	A Nonsense Variant in CCDC65 Gene Causes Respiratory Failure Associated with Increased Lamb Mortality in French Lacaune Dairy Sheep.	We recently demonstrated that the Lacaune deficient homozygous haplotype 6 (LDHH6) potentially hosts a recessive perinatal lethal mutation in Lacaune dairy  sheep mapped on OAR3. In the present study, we have analyzed the whole-genome sequences of two Lacaune ram heterozygous carriers of LDHH6. After variant calling and filtering against the variants of 86 non-carrier rams, we have identified a single nucleotide variant (SNV) in the two LDHH6 carriers whose variant allele induced a premature stop codon (p.Glu111*) in the Coiled-Coil Domain Containing 65 (CCDC65) gene. CCDC65 is involved in the assembly of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex for the formation of microtubules in ciliated cells. In order to identify the phenotype in homozygous sheep, we generated at-risk matings (n = 17) between rams and ewes heterozygous for the candidate variant in CCDC65. A total of 16 lambs were born alive with five genotyped as homozygous carriers. The homozygous lambs suffered from respiratory problems, and four of them died within the first month of life. At necropsy, we observed a broad hepatization of lung lobes possibly induced by infectious pneumonia. The management of this lethal recessive allele (frequency of 0.06) through reasoned mating in the Lacaune sheep selection schemes could reduce lamb mortality by 2%.	0
35227193	Genome variation in tick infestation and cryptic divergence in Tunisian indigenous sheep.	BACKGROUND: Ticks are obligate haematophagous ectoparasites considered second to  mosquitos as vectors and reservoirs of multiple pathogens of global concern. Individual variation in tick infestation has been reported in indigenous sheep, but its genetic control remains unknown. RESULTS: Here, we report 397 genome-wide signatures of selection overlapping 991  genes from the analysis, using ROH, LR-GWAS, XP-EHH, and FST, of 600 K SNP genotype data from 165 Tunisian sheep showing high and low levels of tick infestations and piroplasm infections. We consider 45 signatures that are detected by consensus results of at least two methods as high-confidence selection regions. These spanned 104 genes which included immune system function  genes, solute carriers and chemokine receptor. One region spanned STX5, that has  been associated with tick resistance in cattle, implicating it as a prime candidate in sheep. We also observed RAB6B and TF in a high confidence candidate  region that has been associated with growth traits suggesting natural selection is enhancing growth and developmental stability under tick challenge. The analysis also revealed fine-scale genome structure indicative of cryptic divergence in Tunisian sheep. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide a genomic reference that can enhance the understanding of the genetic architecture of tick resistance and cryptic divergence in indigenous African sheep.	0
34681114	Antibiotic Resistance of Staphylococci from Bulk-Tank Milk of Sheep Flocks: Prevalence, Patterns, Association with Biofilm Formation, Effects on Milk Quality, and Risk Factors.	The objectives of this work were to study prevalence and characteristics of resistance to antibiotics of staphylococcal isolates from the bulk-tank milk of sheep flocks across Greece, to assess possible associations of the presence of antibiotic resistance with the quality of milk in these flocks and to evaluate flock-related factors potentially associated with antibiotic resistance among these isolates. A cross-sectional study was performed in 325 sheep flocks in Greece. Bulk-tank milk samples were collected for bacteriological examination; staphylococcal isolates were evaluated for resistance to 20 antibiotics. Oxacillin-resistant staphylococcal isolates, isolates resistant to any antibiotic, and multi-resistant isolates were recovered from 8.0%, 30.5%, and 12.0% of flocks, respectively. Of 232 isolates, 11.6% were resistant to oxacillin, 46.1% were resistant to at least one antibiotic, and 16.4% were multi-resistant. Resistance was seen more frequently among coagulase-negative (50.6%) than among Staphylococcus aureus (31.5%) isolates. Resistance was more frequent against penicillin and ampicillin (34.1% of isolates), clindamycin (17.7%), and fosfomycin (14.2%). An association was found between biofilm formation by staphylococci and resistance to fosfomycin. For recovery of oxacillin-resistant isolates, the lack of experience by farmers emerged as a significant factor; respective factors for the isolation of staphylococci resistant to any antibiotic or multi-resistant isolates were the early stage of the lactation period (0th-1st month) and the intensive management system applied  in the flocks, respectively.	0
34900349	Prevalence and Risk Factors of Bovine and Ovine Lungworm Infection at Durame District, Southern Ethiopia.	BACKGROUND: Lungworms are parasitic nematodes of the order Strongylidae that infect the lungs of cattle and sheep and cause bronchitis or pneumonia. METHODS: An abattoir-based cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2018 to April 2019 to determine the comparative prevalence and the possible risk factors of lungworm infection in sheep and cattle of Durame district of Kembata Tembaro zone. For this purpose, a total of 410 animals (209 sheep and 201 cattle) were randomly selected and examined for the presence of different lungworm species using the modified Baermann technique and postmortem examination. The sensitivity and specificity of fecal sample test considering necropsy as reference/gold standard was conducted. RESULTS: Accordingly, the overall prevalence of lungworm infection in sheep and cattle was 24.39%. Dictyocaulus filaria and D. viviparous were the only species of lungworm identified in sheep and cattle with a respective prevalence of 44.02% and 3.98%. Putative risk factors such as species and poor body condition have a significant association (p < 0.05) with the occurrence of lungworms in sheep and  cattle. The lungworm infection was higher in the young age group (25.30%) and poor body conditioned (32.14%) animals. Season-wise prevalence revealed that a higher lungworm infection was recorded during autumn (32.14%) as compared to winter (22.81%) and spring (16.2%). Most of the sheep and cattle in the current study were heavily (45.0%) and moderately (39.0%) infected with lungworms whereas the rest 16.0% were infected with a low degree of lungworm infection. The specificity, sensitivity, PPV, and NPV of the modified Baermann technique against the gold standard test were 89.4%, 42%, 56.0%, and 82.7%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that lungworm infection is prevalent in sheep and  cattle of the study area and that was commonly occurs during autumn and affects poorly conditioned sheep and cattle. Thus, routine and strategic deworming for the control and prevention of lungworms in domestic animals should be recommended to overwhelm the prevalence of lungworm infection.	0
34682286	Genomic Diversity Analysis Reveals a Strong Population Structure in Histoplasma capsulatum LAmA (Histoplasma suramericanum).	Histoplasmosis is a severe mycotic disease affecting thousands of immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals with high incidence in Latin America, where the disease agents are Histoplasma capsulatum and Histoplasma suramericanum. In this  work, we used whole-genome sequencing to infer the species diversity and the population structure of H. suramericanum in South America. We find evidence for strong population structure and little admixture within the species. Genome-level phylogenetic trees indicate the existence of at least three different discrete populations. We recovered the existence of a previously identified population, LAmB, and confirm that it is highly differentiated along the whole genome. We also find that H. suramericanum is composed of two populations, one in Northern South America, and another in the southern portion of the continent. Moreover, one of the lineages from the southern population is endemic to Rio de Janeiro and there was no association with clinical data and species isolated from patients with histoplasmosis. Our results point out the need to characterize the symptomatology of histoplasmosis caused by different species and lineages of Histoplasma spp.	0
34789208	Educational differences in diabetes and diabetes self-management behaviours in WHO SAGE countries.	BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus represents a substantial global health challenge, with prevalence rising in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Although diabetes is known to follow a socioeconomic gradient, patterns in LMICs are unclear. This study examined associations between education and diabetes, and diabetes self-management behaviours, in six LMICs. METHODS: Cross-sectional data for 31,780 participants from China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa from the World Health Organization Study on Global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) study were used. Participants aged ≥50 years completed face-to-face interviews between 2007 and 2010. Participants self-reported diabetes diagnosis, physical activity, sedentary time, fruit and vegetable consumption, any special diet/program for diabetes, whether they were taking insulin for diabetes and number of years of education. Height, weight, waist, and hip circumference were measured. Country-specific survey-weighted log-binomial regression models were fitted to examine associations between the number of years of education and self-reported diabetes diagnosis (primary analysis). In secondary analyses, among those with a self-reported diabetes diagnosis, generalised linear regression models were fitted to examine associations between education and i) physical activity, ii) sedentary time, iii) fruit and vegetable consumption, iv) special diet for diabetes, v) taking insulin, vi) BMI, vii) waist circumference and viii) hip circumference. RESULTS: There was strong evidence of an association between years of education and diabetes diagnosis in Ghana (RR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06-1.13) and India (RR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.07-1.12) only. In India, greater years of education was associated with higher leisure physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, rates following a special diet or taking insulin, but also higher mean BMI, waist and hip circumference. Relationships between education and self-management behaviours were rarely seen in the other countries. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between education and diabetes, and behavioural self-management (India only) was more evident in the two least developed (Ghana and India) of the WHO SAGE countries, indicating increasing diabetes diagnosis with greater numbers of years of education. The lack of gradients elsewhere may reflect shifting risk from higher to lower educated populations. While there was  some suggestion that self-management behaviours were greater with increased education in India, this was not observed in the other countries.	0
34944323	Ovine Toll-like Receptor 9 (TLR9) Gene Variation and Its Association with Flystrike Susceptibility.	Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of proteins that play a role in innate immune responses by recognising pathogen-associated molecular patterns derived from various microbes. Of these receptors, TLR9 recognises bacterial and viral DNA containing unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) motifs, and variation in TLR9 has been associated with resistance to various infectious diseases. Flystrike is a problem affecting the sheep industry globally and the immune response of the sheep has been suggested as one factor that influences the response to the disease. In this study, variation in ovine TLR9 from 178 sheep with flystrike and 134 sheep without flystrike was investigated using a polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) approach. These sheep were collected from both commercial and stud farms throughout New Zealand and they were of 13 different breeds, cross-breds and composites. Four alleles of TLR9 were detected, including three previously identified alleles (*01, *02 and *03) and a new allele (*04). In total six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found. Of the three common alleles in the sheep studied, the presence of *03 was found to be associated with a reduced likelihood of flystrike being present (OR = 0.499, p = 0.024). This suggests that variation in ovine TLR9 may affect a sheep's response to flystrike, and thus the  gene may have value as a genetic marker for improving resistance to the disease.	0
34659357	Differential Methylation and Transcriptome Integration Analysis Identified Differential Methylation Annotation Genes and Functional Research Related to Hair Follicle Development in Sheep.	Hair follicle growth and development are a complex and long-term physiological process, which is regulated by a variety of physical factors and signal pathways. Increasing the understanding of the epigenetic regulation and function of candidate genes related to hair follicle development will help to better understand the molecular regulatory mechanisms of hair follicle development. In this study, the methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) was used to obtain the genome-wide methylation map of the hair follicular development of Super Merino sheep in six stages (fetal skin tissue at 65d, 85d, 105d, 135d, 7d, and 30d after birth). Combined with the results of previous RNA-sequencing, 65 genes were screened out that were both differential methylation and differential expression, including EDN1, LAMC2, NR1D1, RORB, MyOZ3, and WNT2 gene. Differential methylation genes were enriched in Wnt, TNF, TGF-beta, and other signaling pathways related to hair follicle development. The bisulfite sequencing PCR results and MeDIP-seq were basically consistent, indicating that the sequencing results were accurate. As a key gene in the Wnt signaling pathway, both differential methylation and expression gene identified by MeDIP-seq and RNA-seq, further exploration of the function of WNT2 gene revealed that the DNA methylation of exon 5 (CpG11 site) promoted the expression of WNT2 gene. The overexpression vector of lentivirus pLEX-MCS-WNT2 was constructed, and WNT2 gene  effectively promoted the proliferation of sheep skin fibroblasts. The results showed that WNT2 gene could promote the growth and development of skin and hair follicles. The results of this study will provide a theoretical basis for further research on sheep hair follicle development and gene regulation mechanisms.	0
34968818	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for litter size in sheep.	Litter size and ovulation rate are important reproduction traits in sheep and have important impacts on the profitability of farm animals. To investigate the genetic architecture of litter size, we report the first meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using 522 ewes and 564,377 SNPs from six sheep breeds. We identified 29 significant associations for litter size which 27  of which have not been reported in individual GWAS for each population. However,  we could confirm the role of BMPR1B in prolificacy. Our gene set analysis discovered biological pathways related to cell signaling, communication, and adhesion. Functional clustering and enrichment using protein databases identified epidermal growth factor-like domain affecting litter size. Through analyzing protein-protein interaction data, we could identify hub genes like CASK, PLCB4, RPTOR, GRIA2, and PLCB1 that were enriched in most of the significant pathways. These genes have a role in cell proliferation, cell adhesion, cell growth and survival, and autophagy. Notably, identified SNPs were scattered on several different chromosomes implying different genetic mechanisms underlying variation  of prolificacy in each breed. Given the different layers that make up the follicles and the need for communication and transfer of hormones and nutrients through these layers to the oocyte, the significance of pathways related to cell  signaling and communication seems logical. Our results provide genetic insights into the litter size variation in different sheep breeds.	0
34861880	Signature selection analysis reveals candidate genes associated with production traits in Iranian sheep breeds.	BACKGROUND: Sheep were among the first animals to be domesticated. They are raised all over the world and produce a major scale of animal-based protein for human consumption and play an important role in agricultural economy. Iran is one of the important locations for sheep genetic resources in the world. Here, we compared the Illumina Ovine SNP50 BeadChip data of three Iranian local breeds (Moghani, Afshari and Gezel), as a population that does not undergone artificial  breeding programs as yet, and five other sheep breeds namely East Friesian white, East Friesian brown, Lacaune, DorsetHorn and Texel to detect genetic mechanisms underlying economical traits and daptation to harsh environments in sheep. RESULTS: To identify genomic regions that have been targeted by positive selection, we used fixation index (Fst) and nucleotide diversity (Pi) statistics. Further analysis indicated candidate genes involved in different important traits such as; wool production included crimp of wool (PTPN3, NBEA and KRTAP20-2 genes), fiber diameter (PIK3R4 gene), hair follicle development (LHX2 gene), the  growth and development of fiber (COL17A1 gene)), adaptation to hot arid environments (CORIN gene), adaptive in deficit water status (CPQ gene), heat stress (PLCB4, FAM107B, NBEA, PIK3C2B and USP43 genes) in sheep. CONCLUSIONS: We detected several candidate genes related to wool production traits and adaptation to hot arid environments in sheep that can be applicable for inbreeding goals. Our findings not only include the results of previous researches, but also identify a number of novel candidate genes related to studied traits. However, more works will be essential to acknowledge phenotype- genotype relationships of the identified genes in our study.	0
35449433	Comparative analysis of long noncoding RNA and mRNA expression provides insights  into adaptation to hypoxia in Tibetan sheep.	Tibetan sheep have lived on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau for thousands of years and have good adaptability to the hypoxic environment and strong disease resistance. However, the molecular mechanism by which Tibetan sheep adapt to this extreme environment, especially the role of genetic regulation, is still unknown. Emerging evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in the  regulation of a diverse range of biological processes. To explore the potential lncRNAs involved in the adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia of Tibetan sheep, we  analysed the expression profile of lncRNAs and mRNAs in the liver and lung tissues of sheep using comparative transcriptome analysis between four Tibetan sheep populations (high altitude) and one Hu sheep population (low altitude). The results showed a total of 7848 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNA transcripts,  and 22,971 DE mRNA transcripts were detected by pairwise comparison. The expression patterns of selected mRNAs and lncRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR, and  the results correlated well with the transcriptome data. Moreover, the functional annotation analysis based on the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases showed that DE mRNAs and the target genes of the lncRNAs were significantly enriched in organ morphogenesis, response to stimulus, haem binding, the immune system, arginine and proline metabolism, and fatty acid biosynthesis. The prediction of mRNA-mRNA and lncRNA-mRNA interaction  networks further revealed transcripts potentially involved in adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia, and the hub genes DDX24, PDCD11, EIF4A3, NDUFA11, SART1, PRPF8 and TCONS_00306477, TCONS_00306029, TCONS_00139593, TCONS_00293272, and TCONS_00313398 were selected. Additionally, a set of target genes, PIK3R1, IGF1R, FZD6, IFNB2, ATF3, MB, CYP2B4, PSMD13, and TGFB1, were also identified as candidate genes associated with high-altitude hypoxia adaptation. In conclusion,  a collection of novel expressed lncRNAs, a set of target genes and biological pathways known to be relevant for altitude adaptation were identified by comparative transcriptome analysis between Tibetan sheep and Hu sheep. Our results are the first to identify the characterization and expression profile of  lncRNAs between Tibetan sheep and Hu sheep and provide insights into the genetic  regulation mechanisms by which Tibetan sheep adapt to high-altitude hypoxic environments.	0
34586970	Survey of the relationship between polymorphisms within the BMPR1B gene and sheep reproductive traits.	The BMPRIB gene is one of the main genes that can be used as a molecular genetic  marker for the early selection of highly productive ewes. It is well-documented that the p.Q249R (g.746A > G) is the first mutation in the kinase domain of the BMPR1B gene that is highly related to increased ovulation rate and litter size. It is likely that the presence of the p.Q249R mutation in the sheep population is one of the factors contributing to the outstanding productivity of the sheep. Moreover, in recent years, researchers have been explored other polymorphisms in  the BMPR1B gene with respect to reproductive traits in sheep. Therefore, we carried out the current study to evaluate the association between polymorphisms in this gene and sheep litter size from all appropriate studies. As a result, among 41 polymorphisms in the ovine BMPRIB gene, eight variants, including p.Q249R (g.746A > G), g.29362047T > C, g.29427689G > A, BMPR1B-2 (ss:1960972599), g.29382337G > A, g.29382340G > A, rs1092293287 (10 bp insertion/deletion) and g.29380965A > G were found to be associated with litter size in sheep. This systematic analysis presents the most current data evidence for BMPRIB polymorphisms, highlighting the need for further large-scale studies to determine more important variants.	0
34657528	Harnessing an Integrated Health Communication (IHC) Framework for Campaigns: A Case of Prescription Drug Decision Making.	Drawing on a multiplicity of mass media and health behavior theories, we propose  an integrated health communication (IHC) framework to understand and leverage the ways in which mass mediated and interpersonal sources of health information influence the public's health behavior in the context of their prescription drug  decisions. Building on the agenda setting theory, two-step flow theory, and the Health Belief Model, we dig into the interrelationships between mass media and interpersonal information sources and information seeking engagement. Employing survey methodology, our framework was tested using a sample of U.S. adults (N = 628). The major results include (a) information gained through interpersonal sources and perceived benefits of the prescription drugs positively and sequentially mediate the association between mass media exposure and intent to seek prescription drug information, (b) interpersonal health information positively moderate the mediation of mass media exposure - perceived benefits - intent to seek prescription drug information, and (c) the inexpert interpersonal  information's positive interaction effect with mass media exposure on intent to seek prescription drug information mediated through perceived benefits was greater with high expert interpersonal communication. These results impart valuable theoretical contributions and have the potential to guide integrated health communication (IHC) campaigns.	0
34544373	Effects of mulberry leaf silage on antioxidant and immunomodulatory activity and  rumen bacterial community of lambs.	BACKGROUND: Rumen is a natural fermentation system and the microorganisms inside  can effectively utilize plant bioresource and interact with host metabolism. Here, analysis of rumen microbiome, together with animal performance and serum metabolism in a lamb model were performed to identify the potential use of mulberry leaf silage (MS) to replace alfalfa silage (AS) as a new functional feed resource and to mining the novel specific mulberry leaf associated rumen bacteria interact with host metabolism. RESULTS: The lambs fed with MS diet showed improved antioxidant capacity and immune function compared to those fed AS diet. The MS diet significantly altered  rumen microbiota α- and β-diversity and taxonomic composition. Microbial analysis revealed that Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Schwartzia were enhanced, and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010 and Lachnospiraceae_XPB1014_group were down-regulated in  the rumen of MS group. A strong association was also found between these rumen microbial taxa and host antioxidant and immunomodulatory capacity. CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that mulberry leaf silage can be a high-quality feed source or bioactive pharmaceutical that is responsible for ruminant's health benefits. The modified rumen microbial community by mulberry leaf silage were associated with the enhanced antioxidant capacity and immunomodulatory of lambs.	0
34666626	Variation in ovine KRTAP8-1 affects mean staple length and opacity of wool fiber.	In this study, keratin-associated proteins gene (KRTAP8-1) from five different sheep breeds and breed-crosses (n = 310) was genotyped using a Polymerase Chain Reaction-Single Strand confirmation Polymorphism (PCR-SSCP). Six unique genotypes were observed: AA, AC, AD, AE, DD and EE, with AA being the most common in the different breeds and crosses. Twelve wool characteristics: yield, mean staple length (MSL), bulk, mean fiber diameter (MFD), fiber diameter standard deviation  (FDSD), coefficient of variation of fiber diameter (CVFD), medullation, standard  deviation of medullation (MeSD), coefficient of variation of medullation (CVMed), opacity, standard deviation of opacity (OpSD), and coefficient of variation of opacity (CVOp) were measured on wool derived from the sheep. Variation in KRTAP8-1 was found to have strong association with MSL, OpSD and CVOp (p ≤ 0.027). The MSL of sheep of genotype AE was greater (p = 0.027) than for sheep of genotype AA. The OpSD of sheep of genotype AA was less (p = 0.017) than  sheep with the AE genotype, and the CVOp of sheep with genotype AA was less (p = 0.018) than sheep with genotype AE. Further studies are required to confirm  the role of variation in KRTAP8-1 in improving quality wool production.	0
34856922	A comprehensive genome-wide scan detects genomic regions related to local adaptation and climate resilience in Mediterranean domestic sheep.	BACKGROUND: The management of farm animal genetic resources and the adaptation of animals to climate change will probably have major effects on the long-term sustainability of the livestock sector. Genomic data harbour useful relevant information that needs to be harnessed for effectively managing genetic resources. In this paper, we report the genome characterization of the highly productive Mediterranean Chios dairy sheep and focus on genetic diversity measures related with local adaptation and selection and the genetic architecture of animal resilience to weather fluctuations as a novel adaptative trait linked to climate change. RESULTS: We detected runs of homozygosity (ROH) and heterozygosity (ROHet) that revealed multiple highly homozygous and heterozygous hotspots across the Chios sheep genome. A particularly highly homozygous region was identified on chromosome 13 as a candidate of directional genetic selection associated with milk traits, which includes annotated genes that were previously shown to be linked to local adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. Favourable heterozygosity related with a potentially protective role against livestock diseases and enhanced overall fitness was revealed in heterozygous-rich regions on sheep chromosomes 3, 10, 13 and 19. Furthermore, genomic analyses were conducted on sheep resilience phenotypes that display changes in milk production  in response to weather variation. Sheep resilience to heat stress was a significantly heritable trait (h2 = 0.26) and genetically antagonistic to milk production. Genome-wide association and regional heritability mapping analyses revealed novel genomic markers and regions on chromosome 5 that were significantly associated with sheep resilience to climate change. Subsequently, an annotation analysis detected a set of genes on chromosome 5 that were associated with olfactory receptor complexes that could participate in heat stress mitigation through changes in respiration rate and respiratory evaporation. Other genes were grouped in previously reported biological processes relevant to livestock heat dissipation, including stress and immune response. CONCLUSIONS: Our results may contribute to the optimal management of sheep genetic resources and inform modern selective breeding programmes that aim at mitigating future environmental challenges towards sustainable farming, while better balancing animal adaptation and productivity. Our results are directly relevant to the studied breed and the respective environmental conditions; however, the methodology may be extended to other livestock species of interest.	0
34556147	Molecular characterization and immune protection of the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene in Echinococcus granulosus.	BACKGROUND: Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a serious parasitic zoonosis caused by  the larvae of the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. The development of an effective vaccine is one of the most promising strategies for controlling CE. METHODS: The E. granulosus 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EgHCDH) gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The distribution of EgHCDH in protoscoleces (PSCs) and adult worms was analyzed using immunofluorescence. The transcript levels of EgHCDH in PSCs and adult worms were analyzed using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). The immune protective effects of the rEgHCDH were evaluated. RESULTS: The 924-bp open reading frame sequence of EgHCDH, which encodes a protein of approximately 34 kDa, was obtained. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that EgHCDH was expressed in both the PSCs and adult worms of E. granulosus. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that EgHCDH was mainly localized in the tegument of PSCs and adult worms. Western blot analysis showed that the recombinant protein was recognized by E. granulosus-infected dog sera. Animal challenge experiments demonstrated that dogs immunized with recombinant (r)EgHCDH had significantly higher serum IgG, interferon gamma and interleukin-4 concentrations than the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) control group. The rEgHCDH vaccine was able to significantly reduce the number of E. granulosus and  inhibit the segmental development of E. granulosus compared to the PBS control group. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that rEgHCDH can induce partial immune protection against infection with E. granulosus and could be an effective candidate for the development of new vaccines.	0
35450541	A prospective cohort study of head circumference and its association with neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants and young children in rural Guatemala.	Microcephaly, an anthropometric marker of reduced brain volume and predictor of developmental disability, is rare in high-income countries. Recent reports show the prevalence of microcephaly to be much higher in lower resource settings. We calculated the prevalence of microcephaly in infants and young children (n = 642; age range = 0.1-35.9 months), examined trends in occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) growth in the year after birth and evaluated the relationship between OFC and performance on the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) in rural Guatemala. Multivariable regression analyses adjusted for age were performed: (1) a model comparing concurrent MSEL performance and OFC at all visits per child, (2) concurrent OFC and MSEL performance by age group, and (3) OFC at enrollment and MSEL at final visit by age group. Prevalence of microcephaly ranged from 10.1% to 25.0%. OFC z-score decreased for most infants throughout the first year after birth. A significant positive association between continuous OFC measurement and  MSEL score suggested that children with smaller OFC may do worse on ND tests conducted both concurrently and ∼1 year later. Results were variable when analyzed by OFC cutoff scores and stratified by 6-month age groups. OFC should be considered for inclusion in developmental screening assessments at the individual and population level, especially when performance-based testing is not feasible.	0
34893307	Periprosthetic femoral fracture type and location are influenced by the presence  of an ipsilateral knee arthroplasty implant: A case-control study of 84 interprosthetic femoral fractures.	BACKGROUND: This multicentre case-control study compares Vancouver Classification System (VCS) grade and Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen/Orthopaedic Trauma Association (AO/OTA) fracture type in interprosthetic femoral fractures (IPFFs) between primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) and ipsilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to periprosthetic femoral fracture (PFF) without ipsilateral TKA. METHODS: Data were collected following institutional approval. Eighty-four IPFFs  were assessed for VCS grade and AO/OTA type. Each IPFF case (84) was matched to five PFF controls (360) by age, gender and stem fixation philosophy (SMD<0.1). VCS grade and AO/OTA type were compared between the IPFF and PFF groups using weighted proportions and medians. RESULTS: Median (IQR) age of IPFF patients was 81.75 (76.57-85.33) years and 61 (72.6%) were female. The commonest VCS grade was B1 (34, 40.5%). The commonest AO/OTA type was spiral (51.8% of VCS B fractures; 50.0% of VCS C fractures). A greater proportion of fractures occurred distal to the stem in IPFF patients versus PFF patients (33.3% versus 18.2%, p = 0.003). VCS grade was significantly  different between groups (p = 0.015). For VCS C fractures, twice as many AO/OTA transverse and wedge fractures occurred in the IPFF group compared to the PFF group (25.0% versus 12.6% and 7.1% versus 3.3%, respectively) although the overall difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.407). CONCLUSION: The presence of an ipsilateral TKA affects the location of PFF with more fractures occurring distal to the stem. A greater proportion of bending type fractures occurred when an ipsilateral TKA was present. These unstable fractures  often require more complex surgery.	0
35192431	Association of SNPs within PTPN3 gene with wool production and growth traits in a dual-purpose sheep population.	Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 3 (PTPN3), a member of the membrane-associated non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family, plays significant roles in the cytoplasm and affects the development and growth of skin and hair. A recent study identified the PTPN3 as the potential gene related to sheep wool quality. To detect single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PTPN3 and elucidate its association with wool production and growth traits in fine wool sheep a total of 644 healthy SG (South African mutton merino♂ × Gansu alpine fine-wool sheep♀, SG) and SSG (South African mutton merino♂ × SG♀, SSG) hybrid sheep were selected. Pooled-DNA sequencing and SNPscan methods were used to scan  and genotype SNPs within PTPN3. Association analyses between SNPs and wool production and growth traits were implemented. Consequently, the results revealed that PTPN3 has six SNPs (two missense mutations, one synonymous mutation, and three intron mutations), of which four loci (SNP2, SNP3, SNP4, and SNP5) were significantly positively correlated with growth and wool traits (p < 0.05). SNP4  was significantly (p < 0.05) linked with thigh wool length, and SNP6 was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with abdomen wool length. Moreover, one strongly linked SNP block was identified to be correlated with wool production and growth traits (body weight and body size). The significant SNPs founded by this study could serve as useful genetic markers for breeding fine-wool sheep.®.	0
35158726	Effects of Leptin, Growth Hormone and Photoperiod on Pituitary SOCS-3 Expression  in Sheep.	This study examined how leptin affects growth hormone (GH) release and investigated the effects of leptin, GH, and day length on the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) mRNA levels in the adenohypophyses of sheep. The study consisted of two experiments. The first experiment was conducted during long (LD) and short (SD) days. Within-season and replicate sheep were centrally infused with Ringer-Locke buffer or leptin three times at 60-min intervals at the beginning of experiments. The second experiment involved adenohypophyses collected from sheep that were euthanized in May or November. Pituitary explants  were treated with medium alone (Control) or medium with leptin or GH at different concentrations and incubated for various times. The results of the first experiment indicated GH concentrations were seasonally dependent and that leptin  had no effect on GH secretion. The results of the second experiment indicated a stronger influence of leptin on the expression of SOCS-3 during the SD season than the LD season. During SDs, significant effects of both GH doses on SOCS-3 expression were observed. These results indicate a strong association between leptin, GH, and SOCS-3, which may explain the disruption of SOCS-3 leptin and GH  signaling and the dominant effect of photoperiod on the above relationships.	0
34879913	Genome-wide association study of a thermo-tolerance indicator in pregnant ewes exposed to an artificial heat-stressed environment.	Environmental heat stress negatively influences sheep production in warm semi-arid regions. An animal's ability to tolerate warm weather is difficult to measure naturally due to environmental variability and genetic variation between  animals. In this study we developed a thermo-tolerance indicator (TTI) to define  heat stress tolerance in pregnant sheep in a controlled environment. Next, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genomic regions and  target genes associated with thermo-tolerance in sheep. Pregnant Columbia-Rambouillet crossbred ewes (n = 127) were heat-stressed inside a climate-controlled chamber for 57 days by increasing the temperature-humidity index to ≥30. Rectal temperature (RT) and feed intake (FI) data were collected daily and used for the predictive TTI analysis. After the tenth day of heat stress, the regression analyses revealed that FI was stable; however, when the ewe's RT exceeded 39.8 °C their FI was less than thermo-tolerant ewes. This average predicted temperature was used to classify each ewe as heat stress tolerant (≤39.8 °C) and non-heat stress tolerant (>39.8 °C). A GWAS analysis was  performed and genomic regions were compared between heat stress tolerant and non-tolerant ewes. The single-marker genomic analysis detected 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with heat stress tolerance (P < 0.0001), whereas the multi-marker Bayesian analysis identified 8 overlapped  1-Mb chromosomal regions accounting for 11.39% of the genetic variation associated with tolerance to heat stress. Four intragenic SNP showed a remarkable contribution to thermo-tolerance, and these markers were within the genes FBXO11  (rs407804467), PHC3 (rs414179061), TSHR (rs418575898) and STAT1 (rs417581105). In conclusion, genomic regions harboring four intragenic SNP were associated with heat stress tolerance, and these candidate genes are proposed to influence heat tolerance in pregnant ewes subjected to an artificially induced warm climate. Moreover, these genetic markers could be suitable for use in further genetic selection programs in sheep managed in semi-arid regions.	0
34894464	Are English-language online patient education materials related to breast cancer  risk assessment understandable, readable, and actionable?	PURPOSE: To evaluate the readability, understandability, and actionability of online patient education materials (OPEM) related to breast cancer risk assessment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We queried seven English-language search terms related to breast cancer risk assessment: breast cancer high-risk, breast cancer risk factors, breast cancer family history, BRCA, breast cancer risk assessment, Tyrer-Cuzick, and Gail model. Websites were categorized as: academic/hospital-based, commercial, government, non-profit or academic based on  the organization hosting the site. Grade-level readability of qualifying websites and categories was determined using readability metrics and generalized estimating equations based on written content only. Readability scores were compared to the recommended parameters set by the American Medical Association (AMA). Understandability and actionability of OPEM related to breast cancer high-risk were evaluated using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT) and compared to criteria set at ≥70%. Descriptive statistics and inter-rater reliability analysis were utilized. RESULTS: 343 websites were identified, of which 162 met study inclusion criteria. The average grade readability score was 12.1 across all websites (range 10.8-13.4). No website met the AMA recommendation. Commercial websites demonstrated the highest overall average readability of 13.1. Of the 26 websites  related to the search term breast cancer high-risk, the average understandability and actionability scores were 62% and 34% respectively, both below criteria. CONCLUSIONS: OPEM on breast cancer risk assessment available to the general public do not meet criteria for readability, understandability, or actionability. To ensure patient comprehension of medical information online, future information should be published in simpler, more appropriate terms.	0
34725768	Stretch-Induced Intimal Failure in Isolated Cerebral Arteries as a Function of Development.	Recent clinical studies have shown that traumatic brain injury is a significant risk factor for stroke. Motivated to better understand possible mechanisms of this association, we studied subfailure disruption of the intima in overstretched sheep cerebral arteries, as this has been implicated in the increased risk of stroke following blunt cerebrovascular injury. Middle cerebral arteries from four age groups (ranging from fetal to adult) were stretched axially to failure, and intimal disruption was captured with a video camera. All vessels demonstrated intimal disruption prior to catastrophic failure, with nearly all incurring disruption at stretch values well below those at ultimate stress (means of 1.56 and 1.73, respectively); the lowest stretch associated with intimal disruption was 1.29. The threshold of intimal failure was independent of age. Additional analysis showed that disruption included failure of both the endothelium and internal elastic lamina. Although our experiments were conducted at quasi-static  rates, the results likely have important implications for vessel function following trauma. Future work should seek to identify subfailure disruption of the cerebrovasculature in head trauma.	0
34730075	Variants of ADPGK gene and its effect on the male reproductive organ parameters and sperm count in Hu sheep.	ADP-dependent glucokinase (ADPGK) plays an important role instead of hexokinase in regulating energy metabolism via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas Pathway. And energy provided via glycolysis promotes testis development and spermatogenesis. In this study, 466 Hu sheep were screened for mutations in the ADPGK gene to examine the association of the ADPGK gene polymorphisms with the testis traits and spermatogenesis. The NC_056060.1: g.31295 C > T SNP was found in the 3'-UTR region, resulting in two genotypes CC and TC type with genotypic frequencies of 0.66 and 0.34, respectively. This mutation was significantly associated with testis weight, testis long circumference, testis short girth, epididymis weight,  and sperm concentration (p < 0.05). Moreover, TC genotype individuals had an increased tendency in the expression of the ADPGK gene and had significant reproductive performance advantages compared with CC genotype individuals in the  study. And compared with the small testes (<50 g), the ADPGK gene expression of big testes (>160 g) increased significantly. This indicates an association between the ADPGK gene and reproductive organ parameters and sperm count in selected Hu sheep breed, and this SNP may serve as an effective DNA molecular marker for marker-assisted selection in Hu sheep breeding programs.	0
34748666	Associations between MHC class II variation and phenotypic traits in a free-living sheep population.	Pathogen-mediated selection (PMS) is thought to maintain the high level of allelic diversity observed in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes. A comprehensive way to demonstrate contemporary selection is to examine associations between MHC variation and individual fitness. As individual fitness  is hard to measure, many studies examine associations between MHC variation and phenotypic traits, including direct or indirect measures of adaptive immunity thought to contribute to fitness. Here, we tested associations between MHC class  II variation and five phenotypic traits measured in free-living sheep captured in August: weight, strongyle faecal egg count, and plasma IgA, IgE and IgG immunoglobulin titres against the gastrointestinal nematode parasite Teladorsagia circumcincta. We found no association between MHC class II variation and weight or strongyle faecal egg count. We did, however, find associations between MHC class II variation and immunoglobulin levels which varied with isotype, age and sex. Our results suggest associations between MHC and phenotypic traits are more  likely to be found for traits more closely associated with pathogen defence than  integrative traits such as bodyweight and highlight the association between MHC variation and antibodies in wild populations.	0
34865600	Comparative analysis of genome-wide copy number variations between Tibetan sheep  and White Suffolk sheep.	The DNA copy number variations (CNVs) are widely involved in affecting various kinds of biological functions, such as environmental adaptation. Tibetan sheep and White Suffolk sheep are two representative indigenous and exotic breeds raised in Sichuan, China, and both of them have many contrasting biological characteristics. In this study, we employed high-throughput sequencing approach to investigate genome-wide CNVs between the two sheep breeds. A total of 11,135 CNV regions (CNVRs) consisting of 6,488 deletions and 4,647 duplications were detected, whose length ranged from 1,599 bp to 0.56 Mb with the mean of 4,658 bp. There were 281 CNVRs segregated between Tibetan sheep and White Suffolk sheep, and 18 of them have been fixed within both breeds. Functional analyses of candidate genes within the segregating CNVRs revealed the thyroid hormone signaling pathway and CTNNB1 gene that would be responsible for differential biological characteristics of breeds, such as energy metabolism, seasonal reproduction, and litter size. Furthermore, the segregating CNVRs identified in this study were overlapped with many known quantitative trait loci that are associated with growth, testis weight, and reproductive seasonality. In conclusion, these results help us better understanding differential biological characteristics between Tibetan sheep and White Suffolk sheep.	0
35309120	Transcriptome Sequencing-Based Mining of Genes Associated With Pubertal Initiation in Dolang Sheep.	Improving the fertility of sheep is an important goal in sheep breeding as it greatly increases the productivity. Dolang sheep is a typical representative breed of lamb in Xinjiang and is the main local sheep breed and meat source in the region. To explore the genes associated with the initiation of puberty in Dolang sheep, the hypothalamic tissues of Dolang sheep prepubertal, pubertal, and postpubertal periods were collected for RNA-seq analysis on the Illumina platform, generating 64.08 Gb clean reads. A total of 575, 166, and 648 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in prepuberty_vs._puberty, postpuberty_vs._prepuberty, and postpuberty_vs._puberty analyses, respectively. Based on Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses, the related genes involved in the initiation of puberty in Dolang sheep were mined. Ten genes that have direct or indirect functions in the initiation of puberty in Dolang sheep were screened using the GO and KEGG results. Additionally, quantitative real-time PCR was used to verify the reliability of the RNA-Seq data. This study provided a new approach for revealing the mechanism  of puberty initiation in sheep and provided a theoretical basis and candidate genes for the breeding of early-pubertal sheep by molecular techniques, and at the same time, it is also beneficial for the protection, development, and utilization of the fine genetic resources of Xinjiang local sheep.	0
35396558	Multi-week prediction of livestock chill conditions associated with the northwest Queensland floods of February 2019.	The compound extreme weather event that impacted northern Queensland in February  2019 featured record-breaking rainfall, persistent high wind gusts and relatively cold day-time temperatures. This caused livestock losses numbering around 500,000 in the northwest Queensland Gulf region. In this study, we examine the livestock  chill conditions associated with this week-long compound weather event and its potential for prediction from eleven world-leading sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) forecast systems. The livestock chill index combines daily rainfall, wind and surface temperature data. Averaged over the event week, the potential heat loss of livestock was in the moderate to high category, with severe conditions on the  day of peak rainfall (5 February). Using calibrated forecasts from the Bureau of  Meteorology's S2S forecast system, ACCESS-S1, a 1-week lead prediction showed a 20-30% probability of extreme livestock chill conditions over the northwest Queensland Gulf region, however the highest probabilities were located to the west of where the greatest livestock impacts were observed. Of the remaining ten  S2S systems, around half predicted a more than 20% chance of extreme conditions,  more than twice the climatological probability. It appears that the prediction accuracy arose from the skilful forecasts of extreme rainfall, as opposed to cold day-time temperature and strong wind forecasts. Despite a clear association between the observed extreme weather conditions and an active Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) event stalling in the western Pacific, the majority of 1-week lead S2S forecasts showed little indication of a slow-down in the MJO. As the livestock chill index was developed for southern Australian sheep, it may not be  the best metric to represent the effects of exposure on tropical cattle breeds. Hence, this study draws attention to the need for tailored diagnostics that better represent the cold effects of summer tropical cyclones and tropical depressions on northern Australian livestock.	0
34795381	Whole-genome sequence analysis unveils different origins of European and Asiatic  mouflon and domestication-related genes in sheep.	The domestication and subsequent development of sheep are crucial events in the history of human civilization and the agricultural revolution. However, the impact of interspecific introgression on the genomic regions under domestication  and subsequent selection remains unclear. Here, we analyze the whole genomes of domestic sheep and their wild relative species. We found introgression from wild  sheep such as the snow sheep and its American relatives (bighorn and thinhorn sheep) into urial, Asiatic and European mouflons. We observed independent events  of adaptive introgression from wild sheep into the Asiatic and European mouflons, as well as shared introgressed regions from both snow sheep and argali into Asiatic mouflon before or during the domestication process. We revealed European  mouflons might arise through hybridization events between a now extinct sheep in  Europe and feral domesticated sheep around 6000-5000 years BP. We also unveiled later introgressions from wild sheep to their sympatric domestic sheep after domestication. Several of the introgression events contain loci with candidate domestication genes (e.g., PAPPA2, NR6A1, SH3GL3, RFX3 and CAMK4), associated with morphological, immune, reproduction or production traits (wool/meat/milk). We also detected introgression events that introduced genes related to nervous response (NEURL1), neurogenesis (PRUNE2), hearing ability (USH2A), and placental  viability (PAG11 and PAG3) into domestic sheep and their ancestral wild species from other wild species.	0
34534381	Whole genome sequencing reveals a complex introgression history and the basis of  adaptation to subarctic climate in wild sheep.	To predict species responses to anthropogenic disturbances and climate change, it is reasonable to use species with high sensitivity to such factors. Snow sheep (Ovis nivicola) could represent a good candidate for this; as the only large herbivore species adapted to the cold and alpine habitats of northeastern Siberia, it plays a crucial role in its ecosystem. Despite having an extensive geographical distribution among all ovine species, it is one of the least studied. In this study, we sequenced and analysed six genomes of snow sheep in combination with all other wild sheep species to infer key aspects of their evolutionary history and unveil the genetic basis of their adaptation to subarctic environments. Despite their large census population size, snow sheep genomes showed remarkably low heterozygosity, which could reflect the effect of isolation and historical bottlenecks that we inferred using the pairwise sequential Markovian coalescent and runs of homozygosity. F4 -statistics indicated instances of introgression involving snow sheep with argali (Ovis ammon) and Dall (Ovis dalli) sheep, suggesting that these species might have been more widespread during the Pleistocene. Furthermore, the introgressed segments, which were identified using mainly minimum relative node depth, covered genes associated with immunity, adipogenesis and morphology-related traits, representing potential targets of adaptive introgression. Genes related to mitochondrial functions and thermogenesis associated with adipose tissue were identified to be under selection. Overall, our data suggest introgression as a mechanism facilitating adaptation in wild sheep species and provide insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying cold adaptation in snow sheep.	0
34543162	Estimation of the associations between GH and DGAT1 genes and growth traits by using decision tree in Awassi sheep.	GH and DGAT1 are candidate genes associated with growth traits in sheep breeds. This study aims to determine the association between growth traits and GH and DGAT1 gene polymorphism using three statistical methods in Awassi sheep. The polymorphism was detected by the PCR-RFLP method. Three genotypes (AA, AB and BB) were observed for GH gene locus with allele and genotype frequency 0.70(A) and 0.30(B); 0.60(AA), 0.20(AB) and 0.20(BB). Three genotypes (CC, CT and TT) were found for DGAT1 gene locus with allele and genotype frequency 0.58(C) and 0.42(T); 0.47(CC), 0.23(CT) and 0.30(TT). The genes were in agreement with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p > 0.05). CHAID, CRT and GLM were used to identify the association between growth traits and gene polymorphism. The results showed an association between GH locus and body weight and tail length. Also, found an association between DGAT1 locus and tail length. The three methods showed similar results in determining the association between genes and growth traits. Thus, the CHAID and CRT methods can evaluate the association between genes and growth traits.	0
35328037	Novel Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms and Haplotype of MYF5 Gene Are Associated with Body Measurements and Ultrasound Traits in Grassland Short-Tailed Sheep.	Myogenic factor 5 plays active roles in the regulation of myogenesis. The aim of  this study is to expose the genetic variants of the MYF5 and its association with growth performance and ultrasound traits in grassland short-tailed sheep (GSTS) in China. The combination technique of sequencing and SNaPshot revealed seven SNPs in ovine MYF5 from 533 adult individuals (male 103 and female 430), four of  which are novel ones located at g.6838G &gt; A, g.6989 G &gt; T, g.7117 C &gt; A  in the promoter region and g.9471 T &gt; G in the second intron, respectively. Genetic diversity indexes showed the seven SNPs in low or intermediate level, but each of them conformed HWE (p &gt; 0.05) in genotypic frequencies. Association analysis indicated that g.6838G &gt; A, g.7117 C &gt; A, g.8371 T &gt; C, g.9471  T &gt; G, and g.10044 C &gt; T had significant effects on growth performance and  ultrasound traits. The diplotypes of H1H3 and H2H3 had higher body weight and greater body size, and haplotype H3 had better performance on meat production than the others. In addition, the dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that there are two active regions in the MYF5 promoter located at -1799~-1197 bp and -514~-241 bp, respectively, but g.6838G &gt; A and g.7117 C &gt; A were out of the region, suggesting these two SNPs influence the phenotype by other pathway. The results suggest that the MYF5 gene might be applied as a promising candidate  of functional genetic marker in GSTS breeding.	0
35282918	Kinetics of heat-induced interactions among whey proteins and casein micelles in  sheep skim milk and aggregation of the casein micelles.	The interactions among the proteins in sheep skim milk (SSM) during heat treatments (67.5-90°C for 0.5-30 min) were characterized by the kinetics of the denaturation of the whey proteins and of the association of the denatured whey proteins with casein micelles, and changes in the size and structure of casein micelles. The relationship between the size of the casein micelles and the association of whey proteins with the casein micelles is discussed. The level of  denaturation and association with the casein micelles for β-lactoglobulin (β-LG)  and α-lactalbumin (α-LA) increased with increasing heating temperature and time;  the rates of denaturation and association with the casein micelles were markedly  higher for β-LG than for α-LA in the temperature range 80 to 90°C; the Arrhenius  critical temperature was 80°C for the denaturation of both β-LG and α-LA. The casein micelle size increased by 7 to 120 nm, depending on the heating temperature and the holding time. For instance, the micelle size (about 293 nm) of SSM heated at 90°C for 30 min increased by about 70% compared with that (about 174.6 nm) of unheated SSM. The casein micelle size increased slowly by a maximum  of about 65 nm until the level of association of the denatured whey proteins with casein micelles reached 95%, and then increased markedly by a maximum of about 120 nm when the association level was greater than about 95%. The marked increases in casein micelle size in heated SSM were due to aggregation of the casein micelles. Aggregation of the casein micelles and association of whey protein with the micelles occurred simultaneously in SSM during heating.	0
35062999	Pasture rewetting in the context of nature conservation shows no long-term impact on endoparasite infections in sheep and cattle.	BACKGROUND: Nature conservation with reduced drainage of pastures has been increasingly promoted in agriculture in recent years. However, moisture on pastures is a crucial factor for the development of free-living stages of many parasite species in ruminants. Hence, for the first time, we conducted a field study between 2015 and 2017 at the German North Sea coast to investigate the long-term effect of pasture rewetting (since 2004) on endoparasite infections in  sheep and cattle. METHODS: We examined faecal samples of 474 sheep and 646 cattle from five farms in spring, summer and autumn each year for the presence of endoparasite infections. Animals were kept on conventionally drained, undrained and rewetted pastures. The association between pasture rewetting and endoparasite infection probability was analysed in generalized linear mixed models and including further potential confounders. RESULTS: Infection frequencies for gastrointestinal strongyles, Eimeria spp. and  Strongyloides papillosus were significantly higher in sheep (62.9%, 31.7% and 16.7%) than in cattle (39.0%, 19.7% and 2.6%). Fasciola hepatica was detected with a frequency of 13.3% in sheep and 9.8% in cattle, while rumen fluke frequency was significantly higher in cattle (12.7%) than in sheep (3.8%). Nematodirus spp., lungworms (protostrongylids, Dictyocaulus viviparus), Moniezia  spp., Trichuris spp. and Dicrocoelium dendriticum were identified in less than 7% of samples. Co-infection with more than three endoparasite taxa was present significantly more often in sheep than in cattle. We identified significant positive correlations above 0.2 for excretion intensities between S. papillosus with strongyles, Eimeria spp. and Nematodirus spp. in sheep and between strongyles and Nematodirus spp. in cattle. Pasture rewetting had no long-term effect on endoparasite infections, neither in sheep nor in cattle. Interestingly, F. hepatica infections decreased significantly in sheep and cattle from 2015 (10.9% and 13.9%) to 2017 (1.4% and 2.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Pasture rewetting for nature conservation did not increase endoparasite infection probability in ruminants in the long term. This finding should be confirmed in ongoing studies aimed at further animal welfare parameters. The rapid decrease in F. hepatica infections over 3 years may suggest climatic impact or competition with rumen flukes in addition to potential anthelmintic treatment after feedback of the results to the farmers.	0
34438687	Evidence for the Continued Occurrence of Chorioretinopathy in Working Sheep Dogs  in New Zealand in 2010.	A study in conducted 1987 by Hughes et al., found that 39% of working sheep dogs  had multifocal retinitis. One of the identified causes was ocular larval migrans, which were a result of migrating ascarid larvae. Since that paper was published,  anthelmintic use in farm dogs has been highly recommended. There has been no follow-up study to determine if fundic lesions are still present. The current study aimed to investigate the prevalence of chorioretinopathy in working sheep dogs in the South-West, Waikato, New Zealand. This was a cross-sectional study of 184 working sheep dogs and 51 owners, undertaken in 2010 with owners sampled from New Zealand's South-West Waikato and Tux North Island Dog Trial Championship. Two-way tables were used to explore the relationship between variables. Significance of association was assessed using a Chi-squared or Fisher exact test as appropriate, with a p-value of <0.05 considered significant. Overall prevalence of chorioretinopathy in the working sheep dogs was 44/184 (24%). A significantly higher prevalence of chorioretinopathy was shown in dogs with increasing age, from 2 years to >8 years (p = 0.0007) and in males (p < 0.0001).  This study concluded that lesions of chorioretinopathy are still present in working sheep dogs in New Zealand.	0
35024036	The Role of Feed Restriction on DNA Methylation, Feed Efficiency, Metabolome, Biochemical Profile, and Progesterone Patterns in the Female Filial Generation (F1) Obtained From Early Feed Restricted Ewes (F0).	Deficient management of replacement animals in the farm during early developmental windows may promote adverse programming effects on reproductive traits and subsequent transmission to the next generation. In this sense, DNA methylation profiles allow researchers to decode epigenetic regulation mechanisms in mammals and identify novel candidate genes correlated with phenotype differences in both dams and offspring. Therefore, improving knowledge in the field of epigenetics and intergenerational effects caused by prenatal and postnatal early nutritional events (e.g., feed restriction) is crucial for refining strategies dedicated to animal breeding. In this study, we determined differences in the global blood methylation patterns, biochemical profile, and metabolome of ewe lambs (F1) born from either early feed restricted dams (F0-RES) or fed ad libitum (F0-ADL). Our data show that functional categories such as those related to cellular processes, phosphorylation, nervous system, immunity response, or reproductive function were enriched significantly in the F1-RES lambs due to differences in the methylation of genes in these categories. These F1-RES lambs did not show differences in feed efficiency during the replacement period but presented higher levels of insulin and triglycerides and reduced concentration of progesterone, whereas the metabolome profile demonstrated variations in the bile acid composition when compared with the F1-ADL lambs. Taken together, all these results suggest that intergenerational effects caused by early feed restriction of dams (F0) may persist in the F1 female lambs with negative consequences on genes involved in cellular processes and reproductive traits.	0
34359185	Associations among Mammary Ultrasound Measurements, Milk Yield of Non-Dairy Ewe Lambs and the Growth of Their Single Lambs.	Mammary cistern size was positively correlated with milk yield of mature dairy ewes, but the association in ewe lambs is unknown. This experiment aimed to examine the associations between mammary ultrasound measurements and the milk yield of ewe lambs at one year of age and to determine the accuracy of using maternal mammary ultrasound to predict single lamb growth rates. Single-bearing ewe lambs (n = 45) were randomly selected and 30 were milked once at weeks three  (W3), five (W5), and seven (W7) of lactation. Mammary ultrasound scans were performed at day 110 of pregnancy, W3, W5, W7, and weaning (L69). Single lambs (n = 30) were weighed at birth and at each mammary scanning event. Udder measurements explained 26.8%, 21.4%, and 38.4% of the variation in milk yield at  W3, W5 and W7, respectively, and 63.5% and 36.4% of the variation in single lamb  growth to W3 and to L69. This ultrasound technique was more accurate in predicting single lamb growth to W3 than milk yield and may enable the identification of pregnant ewe lambs whose progeny would have greater growth rates. More research is needed to identify accurate indicators of superior milk yield and determine whether ultrasound could be used to select ewe lambs.	0
34588087	The relationship between mitochondrial ND5 gene polymorphisms and in vitro embryo production in Sanjabi sheep.	The aim of this study was to investigate mitochondrial ND5 gene polymorphisms and their relationship with in vitro maturation (IVM) and in vitro culture (IVC) of Sanjabi sheep. Blood and ovarian samples of adult ewes were obtained from a local slaughterhouse. For each ovarian sample, cumulus-oocyte complexes larger than 3 mm in diameter were aspirated from follicles, and their IVM and IVC rates were recorded. A 666-bp fragment of the ND5 gene was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction. The samples were genotyped using a modified single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method, and an association study was conducted with IVM and IVC rates. Six different SSCP patterns, designated A, B, C, D, E and F with respective frequencies of 8, 47, 4, 4, 32 and 5%, respectively, were observed. According to the results of association analysis, there was no significant association between the ND1 gene polymorphisms and the IVM and IVC rates (P > 0.05).	0
35423875	Hybrid renewable energy/hybrid desalination potentials for remote areas: selected cases studied in Egypt.	For many socio-economic and demographic issues, majority of the Egyptian population live near the Nile River for thousands of years. Shortage of freshwater resources at remote and rural areas is limiting population settlement  and development. Therefore, it is necessary to find alternative solutions including saline water desalination processes to assist obtaining fresh water for domestic and industrial purposes in these remote areas. The energy needed for the desalination process represents another challenge due to the available fossil fuel limitation, increasing prices and their negative impacts on the environment. These challenges may be tackled by applying hybrid renewable energy (RE) resources such as solar and wind energies as the driving power for the desalination technologies. Many studies are conducted in Egypt, Middle East region and worldwide investigating the possibilities of different desalination systems driven by RE. This article presents a recent review of the global desalination processes with a focus on membrane desalination systems such as reverse osmosis (RO), membrane distillation (MD), hybrid desalination technologies and processes as well as advanced plasmonic nanomaterials for water  distillation derived by RE suitable for remote and isolated areas. Some recent activities for coupling desalination systems with hybrid RE carried-out by the co-authors will be highlighted.	0
35179595	Left ventricular remodelling patterns in patients with moderate aortic stenosis.	AIMS: Moderate aortic stenosis (AS) is associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Because outcomes in patients with AS are ultimately driven by the condition of the left ventricle (LV) and not by the valve, assessment of LV remodelling seems important for risk stratification. This study evaluated the association between different LV remodelling patterns and outcomes in patients with moderate AS. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with moderate AS (aortic valve area 1.0-1.5 cm2) were identified and stratified into four groups according to the LV remodelling pattern: normal geometry (NG), concentric remodelling (CR), concentric hypertrophy (CH), or eccentric hypertrophy (EH). Clinical outcomes were defined as all-cause mortality and a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality and aortic valve replacement (AVR). Of 1931 patients with moderate AS (age 73 ± 10 years, 52% men), 344 (18%) had NG, 469 (24%) CR, 698 (36%) CH, and 420 (22%) EH. Patients with CH and EH showed higher 3-year mortality rates (28% and 32%, respectively) when compared with patients with NG (19%) (P < 0.001). After multivariable adjustment, CH remained independently associated with mortality (HR 1.258, 95% CI 1.016-1.558; P = 0.035), whereas both CH (HR 1.291, 95% CI 1.088-1.532; P = 0.003) and EH (HR 1.217, 95% CI 1.008-1.470; P = 0.042) were associated with the composite endpoint of death or AVR. CONCLUSION: In patients with moderate AS, those who develop CH already have an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Assessment of the LV remodelling patterns  may identify patients at higher risk of adverse events, warranting closer surveillance, and possibly earlier intervention.	0
35454221	Use of Fecal Indices as a Non-Invasive Tool for Ruminal Activity Evaluation in Extensive Grazing Sheep.	For a simple, non-invasive evaluation of nutritional status of sheep kept under extensive grazing conditions on annual rangeland, fecal indices (2,6 diaminopimelic acid, nitrogen, and phosphorus) obtained during the vegetative, reproductive, and dry grassland phenological stages, were correlated with ruminal physiological biomarkers (volatile fatty acids and ruminal ammonia). Through correlation analysis and linear regressions, the degree of association between the variables studied was established. The fecal indices that presented the highest degree of association with ruminal variables were FN and FP, being highly correlated with the production of branched-chain volatile fatty acids (isobutyrate and isovalerate) and with ruminal ammonia (r ≥ 0.65), establishing simple linear regression equations of high significance (p ≤ 0.05). Therefore, fecal indices, especially fecal concentrations of N and P, could reflect the metabolism at the ruminal level and with it the availability of compounds for microbial growth, which would help to establish the nutritional status of sheep herds under extensive grazing conditions.	0
34887490	Genome-wide association study and genomic heritabilities for blood protein levels in Lori-Bakhtiari sheep.	Serum protein levels are related to physiological and pathological status of animals and could be affected by both genetic and environmental factors. This study aimed to evaluate genetic variation of serum protein profile in sheep. Blood samples were randomly collected from 96 Lori-Bakhtiari ewes, a heavy meat-type breed. Total protein, albumin, globulin, α1, α2, β and γ globulins and  IgG levels were measured in blood serum. The samples were genotyped using the Illumina OvineSNP50 BeadChip. The studied traits adjusted for age, birth type, birth season and estimate of breeding value for body weight were considered as pseudo-phenotypes in genome-wide association analysis. In the GWAS model, the first five principal components were fitted as covariates to correct the biases due to possible population stratification. The Plink, R and GCTA software were used for genome-wide association analysis, construction of Q-Q and Manhattan plots and estimation of genetic variances, respectively. Noticeable genomic heritabilities ± SE were estimated for total and γ globulins (0.868 ± 0.262 and 0.831 ± 0.364, respectively), but other protein fractions had zero or close to zero estimates. Based on the Bonferroni adjusted p values, four QTLs located on 181.7 Mbp of OAR3, 107.7 Mbp of OAR4, 86.3 Mbp of OAR7 and 83.0 Mbp of OAR8 were  significantly associated with α1, β, β and γ globulins, respectively. The results showed that the PKP2, IGF2R, SLC22A1 and SLC22A2 genes could be considered as candidate genes for blood serum proteins. The present study showed significant genetic variations of some blood protein fractions.	0
34365864	Interpersonal Communication Influence on Health-Protective Behaviors Amid the COVID-19 Crisis.	Drawing on a multiplicity of mass media and health behavior theories, we propose  an integrated health communication (IHC) framework to understand and leverage the ways in which mass mediated and interpersonal sources of health information influence the public's health behavior in the context of their prescription drug  decisions. Building on the agenda setting theory, two-step flow theory, and the Health Belief Model, we dig into the interrelationships between mass media and interpersonal information sources and information seeking engagement. Employing survey methodology, our framework was tested using a sample of U.S. adults (N=628). The major results include (a) information gained through interpersonal sources and perceived benefits of the prescription drugs positively and sequentially mediate the association between mass media exposure and intent to seek prescription drug information, (b) interpersonal health information positively moderate the mediation of mass media exposure-perceived benefits-intent to seek prescription drug information, and (c) the inexpert interpersonal information's positive interaction effect with mass media exposure  on intent to seek prescription drug information mediated through perceived benefits was greater with high expert interpersonal communication. These results  impart valuable theoretical contributions and have the potential to guide integrated health communication (IHC) campaigns.	0
34388932	Key factors affecting seed germination in phytotoxicity tests during sheep manure composting with carbon additives.	The germination index (GI) was widely applied to evaluate the phytotoxicity of compost. This study investigated the key phytotoxicity factors affecting seed germination in compost by using aqueous extracts in seed germination tests. The relationship between water-soluble substances in compost and seed germination, and their association with the microbial community were identified. In this study, sheep manure (SM) composted along or with three carbon additives (mushroom substrate, MS; cornstalks, CS; garden substrate, GS) for 49 days and, during this time, changes in multiple physical-chemical parameters, carbon and nitrogen matters, germination indexes (GI) and the compost microbiome were monitored. The  results showed that all additives decreased water-soluble total nitrogen (TN), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) and low molecular weight organic acids, and significantly improved the seed germination indexes (seed germination rate, radical length and GI). The GI was correlated with water-soluble carbon degradation products (TOC, butyric acid, humic acid) and certain bacteria (Planifilum, Oceanobacillus, Ruminococcaceae_UCG_005 and Saccharomonospora). A structural equation model revealed that the main factors affecting seed germination were TOC (SM compost), acetic acid (SM+MS compost), humic acid (SM+CS compost), and pH (SM+GS compost). Low TOC and low molecular weight organic acids  contents and higher humic acid content promoted GI. The research results could provide theoretical basis and measures for directional regulation of compost maturity.	0
34919579	Use of spineless cactus associated with legume hay in the feedlot-finishing of lambs in semi-arid regions.	"The objective of this study were to examine the effects of diets containing spineless cactus associated with hays of different legume species [gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium), ""catingueira"" (Caesalpinia bracteosa), ""sabiá"" (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth) and ""catanduva"" (Piptadenia moniliformis Benth)] on the intake, digestibility, performance and carcass traits of lambs. Twenty-four ½ Santa Inês × ½ Soinga lambs with an average body weight of 21.4 ± 2.53 kg were distributed into four treatments in a completely randomized design. Treatments consisted of diets formulated with the association of spineless cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica Mill) and hay of four legume species, namely, ""catanduva"", ""sabiá"" ""catingueira"" and gliricidia. The lowest intakes (P<0.05) of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and total carbohydrates occurred in the animals that received the diet containing catingueira hay. However, there were no diet effects (P>0.05) on the intakes of crude protein (CP), ether extract and non-fibrous carbohydrates. The diets also did not change  (P>0.05) the weight gain (0.197 kg/day) or final weight (33.18 kg) of the lambs or the apparent digestibility coefficients of DM, OM, CP and NDF. Consequently, the parameters of live weight at slaughter (34.10 kg), hot carcass weight (14.81  kg), cold carcass weight (14.66 kg), hot carcass yield (45.60%) and cold carcass  yield (45.07%) exhibited the no response to treatment. In addition to these variables, the diets also did not influence subcutaneous fat thickness (2.54 mm), longissimus muscle area (13.34 cm2), morphometric measurements of the carcass, or the proportions of muscle and fat. Therefore, legume hays associated with spineless cactus can be used to feed ½ Santa Inês × ½ Soinga lambs in the feedlot, as this strategy provides heavy animals at the time of slaughter and carcasses with desirable degrees of muscularity and adiposity."	0
34941843	Roles of WNT6 in Sheep Endometrial Epithelial Cell Cycle Progression and Uterine  Glands Organogenesis.	The uterus, as part of the female reproductive tract, is essential for embryo survival and in the maintenance of multiple pregnancies in domestic animals. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of WNT6 on Hu sheep endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) and uterine glands (UGs) in Hu sheep, with high prolificacy rates. In the present study, Hu sheep with different fecundity, over  three consecutive pregnancies, were divided into two groups: high prolificacy rate group (HP, litter size = 3) and low prolificacy rate group (LP, litter size  = 1). A comparative analysis of the endometrial morphology was performed by immunofluorescence. RNA-seq was used to analyze the gene's expression in endometrium of HP and LP Hu sheep, providing a candidate gene, which was investigated in EECs and organoid culture. Firstly, higher density of UGs was found in the HP Hu sheep groups (p < 0.05). The RNA-seq data revealed the importance of the WNT signaling pathway and WNT6 gene in Hu sheep endometrium. Functionally, WNT6 could promote the cell cycle progression of EECs via WNT/β-catenin signal and enhance UGs organogenesis. Taken together, WNT6 is a crucial regulator for sheep endometrial development; this finding may offer a new insight into understanding the regulatory mechanism of sheep prolificacy.	0
35022681	One-year performance of biorestorative polymeric coronary bypass grafts in an ovine model: correlation between early biomechanics and late serial Quantitative  Flow Ratio.	OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the impact of mechanical factors at baseline on the patency of a restorative conduit for coronary bypass grafts in an ovine model at serial follow-up up to 1 year. METHODS: The analyses of 4 mechanical factors [i.e. bending angle, superficial wall strain and minimum and maximum endothelial shear stress (ESS)] were performed in 3D graft models reconstructed on baseline (1-month) angiograms frame by frame by a core laboratory blinded for the late follow-up. The late patency was documented by Quantitative Flow Ratio (QFR®) that reflects the physiological  status of the graft. The correlation between 4 mechanical factors and segmental QFR (△QFR) were analysed on 10 equal-length segments of each graft. RESULTS: A total of 69 graft geometries of 7 animals were performed in the study. The highest △QFR at 12 months was colocalized in segments of the grafts with the  largest bending angles at baseline. Higher △QFR at 3 months were both at the anastomotic ends and were colocalized with the highest superficial wall strain at baseline. High baseline ESS was topographically associated with higher △QFR at the latest follow-up. Correlations of minimum and maximum ESS with △QFR at 3 months were the strongest among these parameters (ρ = 0.30, 95% CI [-0.05 to 0.56] and ρ = 0.27, 95% CI [-0.05 to 0.54], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limited number of grafts, this study suggests an association between early abnormal mechanical factors and late flow metrics of the grafts. The understanding of the mechanical characteristics could help to improve this novel conduit.	0
35078996	A genome-wide association study of serum proteins reveals shared loci with common diseases.	With the growing number of genetic association studies, the genotype-phenotype atlas has become increasingly more complex, yet the functional consequences of most disease associated alleles is not understood. The measurement of protein level variation in solid tissues and biofluids integrated with genetic variants offers a path to deeper functional insights. Here we present a large-scale proteogenomic study in 5,368 individuals, revealing 4,035 independent associations between genetic variants and 2,091 serum proteins, of which 36% are  previously unreported. The majority of both cis- and trans-acting genetic signals are unique for a single protein, although our results also highlight numerous highly pleiotropic genetic effects on protein levels and demonstrate that a protein's genetic association profile reflects certain characteristics of the protein, including its location in protein networks, tissue specificity and intolerance to loss of function mutations. Integrating protein measurements with  deep phenotyping of the cohort, we observe substantial enrichment of phenotype associations for serum proteins regulated by established GWAS loci, and offer new insights into the interplay between genetics, serum protein levels and complex disease.	0
34597752	Mendelian randomization study of the relation between adiponectin and heart function, unravelling the paradox.	High adiponectin concentrations are generally regarded as beneficial with regard  to cardiometabolic health, but have been paradoxically associated with increased  cardiovascular disease risk, specifically heart failure, in individuals at high cardiovascular risk. We aimed to investigate the association between adiponectin  and heart function parameters, and inversely, we estimated the effect of genetically-determined heart function and NT-proBNP as the main marker of heart failure on adiponectin using Mendelian randomisation. Observational analyses between adiponectin and measures of heart function, i.e. E/A ratio, left, and right ventricular ejection fraction, were performed in participants of the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity (NEO) study, assessed by MRI of the heart (n  = 1,138). Two-sample Mendelian randomisation analyses were conducted to estimate  the effect of NT-proBNP and heart function on adiponectin concentrations using publicly-available summary statistics (ADIPOGen; the PLATO trial). The mean (standard deviation) age was 56 (6) years and mean body mass index was 26 (4) kg/m2. Per five μg/mL higher adiponectin, the E/A ratio was -0.05 (95 % CI: -0.10, -0.01) lower, left ventricle ejection fraction was -0.5 % (95 % CI: -1.1,  0.1) lower, and right ventricle ejection fraction was 0.5 % (95 % CI: -0.1, 1.2)  higher. Genetically-determined NT-proBNP was causally related to adiponectin concentrations in ADIPOGen: per doubling of genetically-determined NT-proBNP, adiponectin concentrations were 11.4 % (95 % CI: 1.7, 21.6) higher. With causal MR methods we showed that NT-proBNP affects adiponectin concentrations, while adiponectin is not associated with heart function parameters. Therefore, reverse  causation may explain the adiponectin paradox observed in previous studies.	0
34974772	An inherited night blindness in Wiltshire sheep.	Twelve cases of adult-onset blindness were identified in a flock of 130 polled Wiltshire sheep in New Zealand over a 3-year period. Affected sheep developed night blindness between 2 and 3 years of age, which progressed to complete blindness by 4 to 5 years of age. Fundic examination findings included progressive tapetal hyperreflectivity and attenuation of retinal blood vessels. Histologically, the retinas had a selective loss of rod photoreceptors with initial preservation of cone photoreceptors. Retinal degeneration was not accompanied by any other ocular or central nervous system abnormalities, and pedigree analysis suggested an inherited basis for the disease. Mating an affected Wiltshire ram to 2 affected Wiltshire ewes resulted in 6 progeny that all developed retinal degeneration by 2 years of age, while mating of the same affected ram to 6 unaffected ewes resulted in 8 unaffected progeny, consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance. Homozygosity mapping of 5 affected Wiltshire sheep and 1 unaffected Wiltshire sheep using an OvineSNP50 Genotyping BeadChip revealed an identical-by-descent region on chromosome 5, but none of the genes within this region were considered plausible candidate genes. Whole-genome  sequencing of 2 affected sheep did not reveal any significant mutations in any of the genes associated with retinitis pigmentosa in humans or progressive retinal atrophy in dogs. Inherited progressive retinal degeneration affecting rod photoreceptors has not been previously reported in sheep, but this disease has several similarities to inherited retinal dystrophies in other species.	0
35097043	Lesion Material From Treponema-Associated Hoof Disease of Wild Elk Induces Disease Pathology in the Sheep Digital Dermatitis Model.	A hoof disease among wild elk (Cervus elaphus) in the western United States has been reported since 2008. Now present in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California, this hoof disease continues to spread among elk herds suggesting an infectious etiology. Causing severe lesions at the hoof-skin junction, lesions can penetrate the hoof-horn structure causing severe lameness, misshapen hooves,  and in some cases, sloughed hooves leaving the elk prone to infection, malnutrition, and premature death. Isolated to the feet, this disease has been termed treponeme-associated hoof disease due to the numerous Treponema spp. found within lesions. In addition to the Treponema spp., treponeme-associated hoof disease shares many similarities with digital dermatitis of cattle and livestock  including association with several groups of anaerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides, Clostridia, and Fusobacterium, neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate, and restriction of the disease to the foot and hoof tissues. To determine if there was a transmissible infectious component to this disease syndrome, elk lesion homogenate was used in a sheep model of digital dermatitis. Ten animals were inoculated with lesion material and lesion development was followed over 7 weeks. Most inoculated feet developed moderate to severe lesions at 2- or 4-weeks post-inoculation timepoints, with 16 of 18 feet at 4 weeks also had spirochetes associated within the lesions. Histopathology demonstrated spirochetes at the invading edge of the lesions along with other hallmarks of elk hoof disease, neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrates, and keratinocyte erosion. Treponema-specific PCR demonstrated three phylotypes associated with elk hoof disease and digital dermatitis were present. Serum of infected sheep had increased anti-Treponema IgG when compared to negative control sheep and pre-exposure samples. Analysis of the bacterial microbiome by sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene showed a community structure in sheep lesions that was highly similar to the elk lesion homogenate used as inoculum. Bacteroidies, Fusobacterium, and Clostridia were among the bacterial taxa overrepresented in infected samples as compared to negative control samples. In conclusion, there is a highly transmissible, infectious bacterial component to elk treponeme-associated hoof disease which includes several species of Treponema as  well as other bacteria previously associated with digital dermatitis.	0
35352359	Genetic polymorphisms within the ETAA1 gene associated with growth traits in Chinese sheep breeds.	Ewing tumor-associated antigen 1 (ETAA1) is an important candidate gene for fat deposition in sheep. This study aimed to investigate the indel variations in the  ETAA1 gene and their associations with growth traits in the 1619 sheep. The polymorphism information content of this indel ranged from 0.308 to 0.375, with medium genetic diversity (0.25 ≤ polymorphism information content ≤ 0.5). The correlation analysis showed that an 8-bp insertion within the ETAA1 gene was significantly associated with growth traits in Luxi Blackhead sheep (LXBH), Lanzhou fat-tailed sheep, Hu sheep, Tong sheep, and Tan sheep (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the ETAA1 gene was significantly associated with several growth traits (p < 0.01), such as chest width and paunch girth of LXBH, Tong, and Tan rams. It was significantly related to the body morphometric traits of LXBH, Lanzhou fat-tailed sheep, Hu, Tong, and Tan ewes. In conclusion, the detected 8-bp indel within the ETAA1 gene was confirmed in sheep, significantly affecting  the growth traits, and might be a potential DNA marker for the selection of high-quality individuals in marker-assisted selection for sheep breeding.	0
34394181	Whole-Transcriptome Analysis of Preadipocyte and Adipocyte and Construction of Regulatory Networks to Investigate Lipid Metabolism in Sheep.	Many local sheep breeds in China have poor meat quality. Increasing intramuscular fat (IMF) content can significantly improve the quality of mutton. However, the molecular mechanisms of intramuscular adipocyte formation and differentiation remain unclear. This study compared differences between preadipocytes and mature  adipocytes by whole-transcriptome sequencing and constructed systematically regulatory networks according to the relationship predicted among the differentially expressed RNAs (DERs). Sequencing results showed that in this process, there were 1,196, 754, 100, and 17 differentially expressed messenger RNAs (mRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), respectively. Gene Ontology analysis showed that most DERs enriched in Cell Part, Cellular Process, Biological Regulation, and Binding terms. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis found that the DERs primarily focused on Focal adhesion, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathways. Forty (40) DERs were randomly selected from the core regulatory network to verify the accuracy of the sequence data. The results of qPCR showed that the DER expression trend was consistent with sequence data. Four novel promising candidate miRNAs (miR-336, miR-422, miR-578, and miR-722) played crucial roles in adipocyte differentiation, and they also participated in multiple and important regulatory networks. We verified the expression pattern of the miRNAs and related pathways' members at five time points in the adipocyte differentiation process (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 days) by qPCR, including miR-336/ACSL4/LncRNA-MSTRG71379/circRNA0002331, miR-422/FOXO4/LncRNA-MSTRG54995/circRNA0000520, miR-578/IGF1/LncRNA-MSTRG102235/circRNA0002971, and miR-722/PDK4/LncRNA-MSTRG107440/circ RNA0002909. In this study, our data provided plenty of valuable candidate DERs and regulatory networks for researching the molecular mechanisms of sheep adipocyte differentiation and will assist studies in improving the IMF.	0
34707374	Serum Albumin as a Cross-Reactive Component in Furry Animals May Be Related to the Allergic Symptoms of Patients with Rhinitis.	BACKGROUND: The prevalence of allergies has increased significantly in the past decade. Further research on allergic diseases caused by furry animals is of great importance for the clinical prevention, diagnosis and treatment of allergies. OBJECTIVE: To identify the sensitization profile and clinical association of various furry animal crude extracts and components based on component resolved diagnosis (CRD). METHODS: A total of 211 patients with allergic rhinitis with sensitivities to cats and/or dogs were recruited, and the specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) against various furry animals (such as dog/cat extracts and their components, pigeon, parrot, duck, chicken, sheep, rat, mouse, goose, cow and horse extracts) were measured to analyze the sensitization profiles, cross-reactivity and clinical relevance with regards to allergies. RESULTS: A total of 91.67% of cat-sensitized patients were sensitive to Fel d 1,  while only 16.03% of cat-sensitized patients responded to Fel d 2. Can f 1 and Can f 5 were the major components of dogs, and the positive rates were 23.53% and 16.18%, respectively. Twenty percent of patients were sensitized to 10 other furry animals, and the positive rate was between 0% and 19.12%. There was a significant correlation between components (Can f 1-5 and Fel d 2) and 5 furry animals (mouse, sheep, Horse, rat, cow), especially between serum albumin (SA) (Can f 3, Fel d 2) and furry animals. Most of the animal crude extracts and components sensitization rates in patients who were SA-positive were significantly higher than that of patients who were SA-negative. In particular, for sensitization to mice, sheep, horses, rats and cows, more than 10-fold higher in patients who were SA-positive than in patients who were SA-negative. The VAS of symptoms and life of quality (LoQ) in the SA-sensitized patients was higher than that in unsensitized patients, and the patients with lipocalin sensitivities had a worse LoQ. CONCLUSION: Serum albumin Fel d 2 and Can f 3, as minor allergens in cats and dogs, but not lipocalin or prostatic kallikrein, is associated with other furry animals presumably due to serum albumin cross-reactivity. Patients sensitized with serum albumin had a significantly higher risk of sensitization to other animals and had a higher rhinitis VAS score.	0
34727013	Variation in the ovine FOXP3 gene and its effect on growth traits in Egyptian Barki sheep.	The aim of the present study was to detect the FOXP3 gene polymorphisms in Barki  sheep at a variable region covering exon 13, intron 13 and the coding sequence in exon 14 and to test the association of these polymorphisms with growth traits. 122 Barki lambs were phenotyped for various growth traits, viz., birth weight (BW), weaning weight (WW), pre-weaning daily gain in weight (ADG1), post-weaning  daily gain in weight (ADG2) and marketing bodyweight (MW). The polymerase chain reaction - single-strand conformational polymorphisms (PCR-SSCP) and DNA sequencing methods were used to identify the genetic variants in the FOXP3 gene.  The associations between the variation in FOXP3 gene and growth traits were tested using a general linear model. Two variants (F1 and F2 with gene frequencies of 0.64 and 0.36, respectively), and three genotypes (F1F1, F1F2 and  F2F2 with frequencies of 0.37, 0.53 and 0.10, respectively) were detected. The association of FOXP3 genotype was significant (p < 0.05) with ADG2 and MW. It is  concluded that FOXP3 genotype might be helpful for sheep breeders to produce fast-growing lambs. However, further studies are needed in a large population to  confirm the association we found.	0
35074618	Ovine footrot in Southern Portugal: Detection of Dichelobacter nodosus and Fusobacterium necrophorum in sheep with different lesion scores.	The Mediterranean climate region of Alentejo in the Southern of Portugal is an important sheep production centre but little is known about the presence and characteristics of Dichelobacter nodosus in association with Fusobacterium necrophorum in the different footrot lesion scores. DNA from 261 interdigital biopsy samples, taken from 14 footrot affected flocks and from three non-affected flocks, were analysed for the presence of D. nodosus and F. necrophorum by real-time PCR. Both virulence and serogroup were determined for 132 and 53 D. nodosus positive biopsy samples, respectively. The co-infection with both bacteria was the commonest epidemiological finding associated with a greater disease severity. There was a statistically significant association (p = 0.002) between footrot-affected flocks and the presence of D. nodosus. Most D. nodosus positive samples were virulent (96.2 %) and belonged to serogroup B (90 %).	0
35177909	Seroprevalence and Associated Risk Factors of Ovine Brucellosis in South Omo Zone, Southern Ethiopia.	BACKGROUND: Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease with economic and public health significance in developing countries that rely on livestock production including  Ethiopia. This study intended to establish the seroprevalence and associated risk factors of ovine brucellosis. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out on seroepidemiology of ovine brucellosis from January 2017 to June 2020 G.C in five districts of South Omo zone, Southern Ethiopia. A total of 1536 sera samples were collected from sheep and serially tested using modified Rose Bengal plate test, competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and complement fixation test to detect antibodies against natural infection by Brucella species. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from individual animals, and flocks for the analysis of the association between expounding and outcome variables. Data were analyzed using STATA version 14.0 and potential risk factors for seropositivity of brucellosis were analyzed using logistic regression. RESULTS: The study discovered an overall 5.40% (95% CI: 6.34, 14.25) and 39.74% (95% CI: 6.50, 6.97) seroprevalence of ovine brucellosis at individual and flock  level, respectively, by a confirmatory test. Age groups, sex, flock size, district, history of abortion, and body condition were significantly associated risk factors with Brucella seropositivity (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: To conclude, the prevalence of ovine brucellosis in the South Omo Zone was relatively high which needs integrated intervention approaches in place  to curb the spread of the disease.	0
34763255	Allele/haplotype variation in the MHC-DQA2 gene in Spanish sheep and its association with footrot susceptibility.	Footrot is a contagious disease that affects the hoof of sheep and other ungulates. The severity of the disease varies from a slight limp to the death of  the individual due to injuries that prevent them from feeding. Variants of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)-DQA2 gene (MHC-DQA2) have been associated  with a greater or lesser susceptibility to footrot in Greek, New Zealand and German sheep. In this study, variation in ovine MHC-DQA2, the absence or presence of footrot and the severity of infection was analysed in 117 Spanish Merino, Black Merino and Churra Lebrijana sheep. A total of 21 alleles/haplotypes and 65  genotypes were found with different frequencies in these breeds. As found in other studies, the MHC-DQA2 allele *1101 appeared to be associated with increased susceptibility to footrot, while allele *1201 appeared to be associated with decreased susceptibility. Overall this would suggest the ovine MHC plays a role in controlling susceptibility to footrot infection and that there are breed differences in susceptibility. Sheep might therefore be able to be selected by their MHC-DQA2 alleles/haplotypes to reduce the incidence of the disease in flocks.	0
35146584	Effects of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) by-products and linseed (Linumusitatissimum) intake on digestibility, body weight gain, and estimated tissular composition in cull fat-tailed ewes.	The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) residues (RR) as dietary supplement in association with linseed (Linumusitatissimum) on digestive aspects and body weight (BW) gain in fat-tailed Barbarine ewes. To achieve this, 24 cull ewes (BW: 33 ± 2.7 kg) were divided into four groups receiving a basal diet composed of 500 g of straw for two groups (S)  and 300 g of straw in addition to 200 g of RR for two other groups (R). All animals received 750 g of concentrate; the usual concentrate (UC) was offered for one S (S-UC) and one R group (R-UC); the linseed concentrate (LC) was also offered for one S (S-LC) and one R group (R-LC). The fattening and digestibility  trials lasted 90 days. The dry matter (DM) intake and digestibility were similar  across the groups. However, the crude protein (CP) intake and digestibility and the neutral detergent fiber intake were significantly affected by the treatments  (P > 0.05). The nitrogen intake (NI), the fecal, and retained nitrogen were significantly affected by the regimen (P < 0.05); however, the urinary nitrogen was unchanged. The nitrogen balance was positive for all groups averaging 60% of  the NI. The ruminal pH, ammonia nitrogen, and protozoa concentration were not affected by the RR intake and linseed supply; however, the control time affected  significantly these parameters. Final BW, the average daily gain, the muscle, and fat contents were neither affected by the basal diet nor by the concentrate type  (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the RR intake in association with linseed did not alter the animal's performances by improving their productive characteristics and consequently, the commercial value of this sheep's category.	0
34514660	The association between female reproductive performance and leukocyte telomere length in wild Soay sheep.	Telomere length (TL), typically measured across a sample of blood cells, has emerged as an exciting potential marker of physiological state and of the costs of investment in growth and reproduction within evolutionary ecology. While there is mounting evidence from studies of wild vertebrates that short TL predicts raised subsequent mortality risk, the relationship between reproductive investment and TL is less clear cut, and previous studies report both negative and positive associations. In this study, we examined the relationship between TL and different aspects of maternal reproductive performance in a free-living population of Soay sheep. We find evidence for shorter TL in females that bred, and thus paid any costs of gestation, compared to females that did not breed. However, we found no evidence for any association between TL and litter size. Furthermore, females that invested in gestation and lactation actually had longer TL than females who only invested in gestation because their offspring died shortly after birth. We used multivariate models to decompose these associations  into among- and within-individual effects, and discovered that within-individual  effects were driving both the negative association between TL and gestation, and  the positive association between TL and lactation. This suggests that telomere dynamics may reflect recent physiologically costly investment or variation in physiological condition, depending on the aspect of reproduction being investigated. Our results highlight the physiological complexity of vertebrate reproduction, and the need to better understand how and why different aspects of  physiological variation underpinning life histories impact blood cell TL.	0
34963194	A mutation modulating DDX3Y gene expression cosegregates with the major Y-chromosomal haplogroups and with testis size in Hu sheep.	Variations in the Y-chromosome are usually correlated with male-specific traits.  However, this condition has been described only sporadically, even in human genetics. The present study was conducted to clone the full-length gene sequence  of ovine DEAD-box helicase 3, Y-linked (DDX3Y), and investigate the effect of the expression and variation of DDX3Y on the reproductive traits of Hu sheep. Consequently, we identified the full coding sequence and genomic sequence of ovine DDX3Y. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis showed that ovine DDX3Y was highly  expressed in testis, and the expression level increased during testicular development. Furthermore, individuals with larger testis at 6 months expressed significantly more DDX3Y mRNA in the testis than individuals with smaller testis. Notably, a novel SNP (g. 12657 C>A) in the 3' untranslated region was identified  in Hu sheep and Tan sheep according to the investigation of the full DDX3Y genomic sequence of 1069 individuals from nine sheep breeds. Association analysis revealed that the SNP was significantly related to testis size in Hu sheep. Meanwhile, Hu rams with the derived C allele showed significantly higher expression levels of DDX3Y in testis than those with the ancestral A allele. In addition, data mining in a previous study showed that the C allele cosegregated with the globally major Y-chromosomal haplogroups y-HA and y-HC, and the A allele is found in all rams with haplogroups y-HB1, y-HB2 and y-HD. This study suggests  that the association of the Y-chromosomal haplogroups with testis size in Hu sheep can be extrapolated to the sheep population worldwide.	0
35192073	Association between host genetics of sheep and the rumen microbial composition.	A synergy between the rumen microbiota and the host genetics has created a symbiotic relationship, beneficial to the host's health. In this study, the association between the host genetics and rumen microbiome of Damara and Meatmaster sheep was investigated. The composition of rumen microbiota was estimated through the analysis of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, while the sheep blood DNA was genotyped with Illumina OvineSNP50 BeadChip and the genome-wide association (GWA) was analyzed. Sixty significant SNPs dispersed in 21 regions across the Ovis aries genome were found to be associated with the relative abundance of seven genera: Acinetobacter, Bacillus, Clostridium, Flavobacterium, Prevotella, Pseudomonas, and Streptobacillus. A total of eighty-four candidate genes were identified, and their functional annotations were mainly associated with immunity responses and function, metabolism, and signal transduction. Our results propose that those candidate genes identified in the study may be modulating the composition of rumen microbiota and further indicating the significance of comprehending the interactions between the host and rumen microbiota to gain better insight into the health of sheep.	0
34593736	Bone Mineralization and Spinal Fusion Evaluation of a Truss-based Interbody Fusion Device: Ovine Finite Element Analysis with Confirmatory In Vivo Outcomes.	STUDY DESIGN: Finite element analysis (FEA) and in vivo ovine spinal interbody fusion study. OBJECTIVE: To determine comparative load-induced strain amplitudes, bone mineralization and fusion outcomes associated with different diameter struts in a truss-based interbody fusion device. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Additive manufacturing technology has been employed to develop implants that actively participate in the fusion process. The truss device enables the optimal transfer of compressive and tensile stresses via the struts. Mechanobiologic principles postulate that strut diameter can be regulated to allow different magnitudes of strain distribution within the struts which may  affect fusion rates. METHODS: Modeling of strain distributions as a function of strut diameter (0.75,  1.0, 1.25, and 1.5 mm) employed FEA that simulated physiologic loading conditions. A confirmatory in vivo ovine lumbar spinal interbody fusion study compared fusion scores and bone histomorphometric variables for cages with 0.75 and 1.5 mm strut diameters. Outcomes were compared at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up intervals. RESULTS: FEA showed an inverse association between strut diameter and peak strain amplitude. Cages with 1.0, 1.25, and 1.5 mm struts had peak strain values that were 36%, 60%, and 73% lower than the 0.75 mm strut strain value. In vivo results showed the mean fusion score for the 0.75 mm diameter strut cage was significantly greater by 3-months versus the 1.5 mm strut cage, and remained significantly higher at each subsequent interval (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Fusion rates were 95%, 100%, and 100% (0.75 mm) and 72.7%, 86.4%, and 95.8% (1.5 mm) at 3, 6, and 12 months. Thinner struts had greater mineralized bone tissue and less fibrous/chondral tissue than the thicker struts at each follow-up. CONCLUSION: Validating FEA estimates, cages with smaller diameter struts exhibited more rapid fusion consolidation and more aggressive osseointegration compared with cages with larger diameters struts.Level of Evidence: 4.	0
34429028	Variations in the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and its association with growth traits in Chinese black Tibetan sheep (Ovis aries).	This paper presented the results on the study of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) polymorphisms in Chinese black Tibetan sheep. Via DNA direct sequencing, four variations within 3' untranslated region (UTR) of IRS1, including g.9382T > G, g.9569T > G, g.9572C > T and g.9695A > C were detected in the black  Tibetan sheep population. Based on the χ2 test, those four loci deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p < 0.05). In g.9569T > G locus, genotype of GG possessed advantage on body weight (p < 0.05). In g.9572C > T locus, individuals  with genotype of TT homozygous mutation decreased significantly on body weight, withers height, body length and chest circumference (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). In g.9695A > C locus, the body weight and chest circumference were also higher in AA carriers than in CC carriers (p < 0.05). Our results provided evidence that polymorphisms in IRS1 were associated with growth efficiency traits by quantitative genetic analysis, and may be used for marker-assisted selection in Chinese indigenous sheep.	0
34971343	Polymorphism of sheep PRKAA2 gene and its association with growth traits.	Small ruminants farming plays an important role in the livelihood of a large part of the population. Herein we aimed to analyze the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms in PRKAA2 gene on the growth-related traits of Hu sheep and Dorper  sheep. The body weight and body type of 1254 sheep were measured at 80, 100, 120, 140, 160 and 180d, and 37620 phenotypic data were collected. RT-qPCR analysis was performed to test PRKAA2 gene expressed in different tissues of sheep, with the highest expression level in spleen, followed by kidney. In the present study, the PRKAA2 gene sequencing revealed one polymorphism located on Chr1 (Oar_rambouillet_v1.0), termed as chr1:32832382 G > A, and were significantly associated with growth traits of sheep (p < 0.05). The body weight, body length,  chest circumference, and cannon circumference of individuals with AA genotype were significantly higher than those with the GG and GA genotypes (p < 0.05). Our findings reveal that PRKAA2 gene could be used as a marker-assisted selection to  improve the growth-related traits of sheep.	0
34893624	Using imputation to provide harmonized longitudinal measures of cognition across  AIBL and ADNI.	To improve understanding of Alzheimer's disease, large observational studies are  needed to increase power for more nuanced analyses. Combining data across existing observational studies represents one solution. However, the disparity of such datasets makes this a non-trivial task. Here, a machine learning approach was applied to impute longitudinal neuropsychological test scores across two observational studies, namely the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study (AIBL) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) providing an overall harmonised dataset. MissForest, a machine learning algorithm, capitalises on the underlying structure and relationships of data to impute test  scores not measured in one study aligning it to the other study. Results demonstrated that simulated missing values from one dataset could be accurately imputed, and that imputation of actual missing data in one dataset showed comparable discrimination (p < 0.001) for clinical classification to measured data in the other dataset. Further, the increased power of the overall harmonised dataset was demonstrated by observing a significant association between CVLT-II test scores (imputed for ADNI) with PET Amyloid-β in MCI APOE-ε4 homozygotes in the imputed data (N = 65) but not for the original AIBL dataset (N = 11). These results suggest that MissForest can provide a practical solution for data harmonization using imputation across studies to improve power for more nuanced analyses.	0
34928775	The ND1 and CYTB genes polymorphisms associated with in vitro early embryo development of Sanjabi sheep.	This study aimed to investigate the association between polymorphisms of ND1 and  CYTB genes and in vitro early embryo development of Sanjabi sheep. Blood and ovarian samples were collected from a local slaughterhouse. The cumulus-oocyte complexes with a diameter greater than 3 mm were aspirated from follicles, and in vitro maturation (IVM) and in vitro culture (IVC) rates of them were recorded. A respective 1200 bp and 980 bp fragments of ND1 and CYTB genes were genotyped using a modified single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method. The results of this study revealed that four different patterns, named as A, B, C, and D were observed for both ND1 and CYTB genes. The ND1 gene polymorphisms had significant effects on the IVM and IVC rate (p < 0.05). The pattern C of the ND1  gene significantly increased the IVM rate compared to the patterns A, B and D. For the IVC, the highest and lowest means were related to the C and B patterns, respectively. The CYTB gene polymorphisms also had significant effects on IVC (p < 0.01), but the IVM did not affected (p = 0.07). Here, the pattern D had the  highest and the pattern C had the lowest means for both IVM and IVC rates.	0
35127102	Genotypic and allelic frequency of a mutation in the NHEJ1 gene associated with collie eye anomaly in dogs in Italy.	BACKGROUND: A 7.8-kb deletion in intron 4 of the NHEJ1 canine gene is associated  with Collie Eye Anomaly (CEA). This deletion has been described in sheep-herding  breeds related to the collie lineage and in several other dog breeds. A genetic test based on this association can distinguish three genotypes: normal, carrier and affected. The present study is a retrospective investigation of the presence  of the CEA allele frequencies in selected breeds from the Italian dog population  over a 10-year time span. METHODS: Genotype data, for the 7.8 kb deletion in intron 4 of the NHEJ1 gene, from 496 dogs belonging to Border collie (BC, n = 334), Shetland Sheepdog (SS, n = 74), Australian Shepherd (AS, n = 52), Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever (NS, n = 20) and Rough Collie (RC, n = 16) were analysed. The genetic frequency of CEA allele was estimated in breeds with higher observations (BC, SS and AS). RESULTS: Healthy carriers were 50%, 45%, 29.6%, 17.3% and 12.5% in SS, NS, BC, AS and RC, respectively. The affected recessive homozygotes were 81.3%, 10.8% and 1.5% in RC, SS and BC, respectively. The CEA allelic frequencies were 0.36, 0.16  and 0.087 in SS, BC and AS, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results support the usefulness of this type of genetic analysis to optimize the care of dogs where the CEA mutation is present, including assessing the health risk to susceptible dogs within a breed and to provide an objective basis for breeding programmes.	0
34962189	The time-continuous association between turnout and axial joint moments in the competitive Irish dance 'fly' landing.	Turnout is a key technical and aesthetic element in competitive Irish dance involving external rotation of the lower limb and must be sustained during landings. 'Forced' turnout, aided by floor friction rather than active hip rotation, is likely to result in large internal rotation moments at the knee and  ankle, which may increase the risk of injury. The aim of the current study was to establish the relationship between the hip and ankle external rotation vector field and maximum internal rotation moments of the ankle and knee. Thirteen (12 female) competitive Irish dancers performed 10 flys (common Irish dance leap) onto a force plate while being recorded by a ten-camera motion capture system. Time-continuous data were analysed over the duration of landing using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). A positive correlation (p < 0.05) was found between the hip-ankle turnout vector field and maximum ankle internal rotation moments throughout most of the landing. Post-hoc analyses showed that hip external rotation contributed the most to the maximum ankle internal rotation moment (p < 0.05). Increasing hip turnout during landing could reduce internal rotation moments, assuming hip turnout brings the thigh and foot axial orientation more in line with each other.	0
34550484	Can roughage: concentrate ratio affect the action of red propolis extract on sheep metabolism?	The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the addition of red propolis extract (RPE), in different roughage: concentrate (R:C) ratios, influences the intake, digestibility, ruminal parameters, and serum biochemistry of sheep. We used eight Santa Inês sheep with an average body weight of 29.45 ± 1.58 kg, housed in metabolism cages for 60 days, and distributed in two simultaneous Latin square designs in a 2 × 2 factorial scheme. The factors consisted of two R:C ratios (70:30 and 30:70) with or without the addition of 15 mL/day of RPE. No interactions were found (P > 0.05) between R:C ratios and with or without RPE. Sheep fed 30:70 ratio showed higher (P < 0.05) intake and dry matter (DM) digestibility and non-fibrous carbohydrates and lower (P < 0.05) intake and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility. The addition of RPE did not influence (P > 0.05) the intake or nutrients digestibility, but the sheep that received RPE had a higher (P < 0.05) ruminal pH and longer (P < 0.05) time of rumination (min/kg DM) compared to the group without propolis. The ruminal ammonia concentration was higher for sheep fed 70:30 ratio, but the concentrations of total protein and albumin did not differ between R:C ratios. The addition of 15 mL of RPE does not influence the intake, digestibility, ingestive behavior, and rumen ammonical nitrogen of sheep. There is no association between the R:C ratio and the addition of 15 mL/day of RPE for sheep.	0
34864942	Moderate aortic stenosis: importance of symptoms and left ventricular ejection fraction.	AIMS: The aim of this study is to investigate the independent determinants of survival in patients with moderate aortic stenosis (AS), stratified by severity of symptoms and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with a first diagnosis of moderate AS (aortic valve area >1.0 and ≤1.5 cm2) were identified. Patients were stratified by New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class (NYHA I, NYHA II, or NYHA III-IV) and LVEF (LVEF ≥60%, LVEF 50-59%, or LVEF <50%) at the time of moderate AS diagnosis. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, while the secondary endpoint included all-cause mortality and aortic valve replacement. Of 1961 patients with  moderate AS (mean age 73 ± 10 years, 51% men), 1108 (57%) patients were in NYHA class I, while 527 (27%) and 326 (17%) patients had symptoms of NYHA class II and III-IV, respectively. Regarding LVEF, 1032 (53%) had LVEF ≥60%, 544 (28%) LVEF 50-59%, and 385 (20%) LVEF <50%. During a median follow-up of 50 (23-82) months,  868 (44%) patients died. On multivariable analysis, NYHA class II [hazard ratio (HR): 1.633; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.431-1.864; P < 0.001], NYHA class III-IV (HR: 2.084; 95% CI: 1.797-2.417; P < 0.001), LVEF 50-59% (HR: 1.194; 95% CI: 1.013-1.406; P = 0.034), and LVEF <50% (HR: 1.694; 95% CI: 1.417-2.026; P < 0.001) were independently associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSION: Moderate AS is associated with poor long-term survival. Baseline symptom severity and LVEF are associated with worse outcomes in these patients. Patients with low-normal LVEF (<60%) and mild symptoms (NYHA II) already have an  increased risk of adverse events.	0
34551677	Mutations in porin LamB contribute to ceftazidime-avibactam resistance in KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae.	Ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI) shows promising activity against carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP), however, CAZ-AVI resistance have emerged recently. Mutations in KPCs, porins OmpK35 and/or OmpK36, and PBPs are known to contribute to the resistance to CAZ-AVI in CRKP. To identify novel CAZ-AVI resistance mechanism, we generated 10 CAZ-AVI-resistant strains from 14 CAZ-AVI susceptible KPC-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) strains through in vitro multipassage resistance selection using low concentrations of CAZ-AVI. Comparative genomic analysis for the original and derived mutants identified CAZ-AVI resistance-associated mutations in KPCs, PBP3 (encoded by ftsI), and LamB, an outer membrane maltoporin. CAZ-AVI susceptible KPC-Kp strains became resistant when complemented with mutated blaKPC genes. Complementation experiments also showed that a plasmid borne copy of wild-type lamB or ftsI gene  reduced the MIC value of CAZ-AVI in the induced resistant strains. In addition, blaKPC expression level increased in four of the six CAZ-AVI-resistant strains without KPC mutations, indicating a probable association between increased blaKPC expression and increased resistance in these strains. In conclusion, we here identified a novel mechanism of CAZ-AVI resistance associated with mutations in porin LamB in KPC-Kp.	0
34704550	Stearic acid does not overcome conjugated linoleic acid trans-10, cis-12-induced  milk fat depression in lactating ewes.	The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that stearic acid (SA) supplementation increases milk fat content and overcomes the antilipogenic effects of trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in lactating ewes. Twenty-eight Lacaune ewes (36 (sd 2) days in lactation; 70·5 (sd) 9·6 kg of body  weight), producing 1·8 (sd 0·4) kg of milk/d, were used in a completely randomised design (seven ewes/treatment) for 21 d. The treatments were: (1) Control; (2) CLA (6·4 g/d of trans-10, cis-12 CLA); (3) SA (28 g/d of SA) and (4) SA in association with trans-10, cis-12 CLA (CLASA; 6·4 g/d of trans-10, cis-12 CLA plus 28 g/d of SA). All data were analysed using a mixed model that included  the fixed effect of treatment and the random effect of ewe. SA did not alter milk fat content and yield relative to Control (91·9 v. 91·2 (sd 4·1) g/d). CLASA was  not able to overcome the reduction in fat content and fat yield induced by CLA (75 v. 82 (sd 0·14) g/d). SA increased the relative abundance of CD36, fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) and PPAR-γ mRNA by 140, 112 and 68 % compared with CLASA. SA also reduced the relative abundance of acetyl-CoA carboxylase α promoter II and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) when compared with Control (45 and  39 %). Compared with CLA, CLASA treatment had no effect on the mRNA abundance of  fatty acid synthase, lipoprotein lipase, CD36, SCD, FABP4, acylglycerolphosphate  acyltransferase 6, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and PPAR-γ. In conclusion, SA supplementation did not increase milk fat synthesis and did not overcome the CLA-induced milk fat depression when associated with trans-10, cis-12 CLA.	0
35299915	Synergistic action of Viteselen with anti-Fasciola drug as a tool for improving fertility and hemato-biochemical biomarkers in Fasciola infected sheep.	Fasciolosis causes public health problems and economic losses all over the world. The present study aimed to evaluate the synergistic action between Viteselen (anti-oxidant) and specific anti-Fasciola drug [Triclalbendazole (TCBZ)] for improving the body condition of F. gigantica naturally infected sheep with reference to some hematological and biochemical biomarkers in their sera. Animals were divided into five groups include G-1 as control non-infected animals, G-2 to G-5 are Fasciola naturally infected animals. G-2 are non-treated animals, G-3 treated with TCBZ, animals in G-4 were injected by Viteselen and those in G-5 were treated by both TCBZ and Viteselen. The results revealed a significant decrease in mean eggs in feces and F. gigantica circulating antigens (FCAg) in sera of TCBZ treated sheep after the 1st week post treatment. Complete disappearance of eggs from feces of drug treated groups was recorded at 21st d.p.t. While the value of FCAg decreased to negative at 14th d.p.t. The highest significant improvement (p < 0.05) in the estimated hematological parameters (RBCs, Hb and TLC), liver enzymes (AST and ALT), oxidative stress and anti-oxidant markers (TAC, MDA, SOD and GSH) and reproductive hormones (Progesterone and Estradiol) was recorded in animals in G-5 followed by G-3. While non-significant improvement was recorded in animals in G-4 in comparison with those in the control group. This improvement increased with increasing the time post treatment. In conclusion; using of Viteselen in association with specific anti-parasitic drug improved the general health parameters and reproductive performance of the investigated sheep.	0
35378505	Prevalence of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus among Livestock and Ticks in  Zhambyl Region, Kazakhstan, 2017.	Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a highly fatal zoonotic disease endemic to Kazakhstan. Previous work estimated the seroprevalence of CCHF virus (CCHFV) among livestock owners in the Zhambyl region of southern Kazakhstan at 1.2%. To estimate CCHFV seroprevalence among cattle and sheep, we selected 15 villages with known history of CCHFV circulation (endemic) and 15 villages without known circulation (nonendemic) by cluster sampling with probability proportional to livestock population size. We collected whole blood samples from 521 sheep and 454 cattle from randomly selected households within each village and collected ticks found on the animals. We tested livestock blood for CCHFV-specific IgG antibodies by ELISA; ticks were screened for CCHFV RNA by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and CCHFV antigen by antigen-capture ELISA. We administered questionnaires covering animal demographics and livestock  herd characteristics to an adult in each selected household. Overall weighted seroprevalence was 5.7% (95% CI: 3.1, 10.3) among sheep and 22.5% (95% CI: 15.8,  31.2) among cattle. CCHFV-positive tick pools were found on two sheep (2.4%, 95%  CI: 0.6, 9.5) and three cattle (3.8%, 95% CI: 1.2, 11.5); three CCHFV-positive tick pools were found in nonendemic villages. Endemic villages reported higher seroprevalence among sheep (15.5% versus 2.8%, P < 0.001) but not cattle (25.9% versus 20.1%, P = 0.42). Findings suggest that the current village classification scheme may not reflect the geographic distribution of CCHFV in Zhambyl and underscore that public health measures must address the risk of CCHF even in areas without a known history of circulation.	0
35079000	Coding and regulatory variants are associated with serum protein levels and disease.	Circulating proteins can be used to diagnose and predict disease-related outcomes. A deep serum proteome survey recently revealed close associations between serum protein networks and common disease. In the current study, 54,469 low-frequency and common exome-array variants were compared to 4782 protein measurements in the serum of 5343 individuals from the AGES Reykjavik cohort. This analysis identifies a large number of serum proteins with genetic signatures overlapping those of many diseases. More specifically, using a study-wide significance threshold, we find that 2021 independent exome array variants are associated with serum levels of 1942 proteins. These variants reside in genetic loci shared by hundreds of complex disease traits, highlighting serum proteins' emerging role as biomarkers and potential causative agents of a wide range of diseases.	0
35456472	Genetic Polymorphisms of IGF1 and IGF1R Genes and Their Effects on Growth Traits  in Hulun Buir Sheep.	The identification of candidate genes and genetic variations associated with growth traits is important for sheep breeding. Insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and insulin like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) are well-accepted candidate genes that affect animal growth and development. The current study attempted to assess the association between IGF1 and IGF1R genetic polymorphisms  and growth traits in Hulun Buir sheep. To achieve this goal, we first identified  three and ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in exons of IGF1 and IGF1R in Hulun Buir sheep and then constructed six haplotypes of IGF1R based on linkage disequilibrium, respectively. Association studies were performed between SNPs and haplotypes of IGF1 and IGF1R with twelve growth traits in a population encompassing 229 Hulun Buir sheep using a general linear model. Our result indicated three SNPs in IGF1 were significantly associated with four growth traits (p &lt; 0.05). In IGF1R, three SNPs and two haplotype blocks were significantly associated with twelve growth traits (p &lt; 0.05). The combined haplotype H5H5 and H5H6 in IGF1R showed the strong association with 12 superior growth traits in Hulun Buir sheep (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, we identified SNPs and haplotype combinations associated with the growth traits, which provided genetic resources for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in Hulun Buir sheep breeding.	0
34481004	Expression of ovine CTNNA3 and CAP2 genes and their association with growth traits.	Growth traits is a critical economic trait for animal husbandry. In this study, the SNPs of CTNNA3 and CAP2 genes were investigated to check whether they are associated with growth traits (body weight, body height, body length and chest circumference) in Hu sheep. The result of the association analysis indicated that the mutation in CTNNA3 (g.2018018 A > G) were associated significantly with body  weight, body height, body length and chest circumference (P < 0.05), the mutation in CAP2 (g.8588 T > C) were associated significantly with body height at 140, 160, 180 days (P < 0.05), AA and CC of CTNNA3 and CAP2 were the dominant genotypes associated with growth traits in Hu sheep. Moreover, combined effect analyses indicated that the growth traits with combined genotypes AACTNNA3-CCCAP2 and AACTNNA3-CTCAP2 were higher than those with genotype GGCTNNA3-CTCAP2. RT-qPCR indicated that CTNNA3 expression levels were significantly higher in liver and lung than in other nine tissues (P < 0.05), CAP2 expression levels were significantly higher in bone, heart, liver, lung and duodenum than in other six tissues (P < 0.05). In conclusion, CTNNA3 and CAP2 polymorphisms could be used as genetic markers for improving growth traits in Hu sheep husbandry.	0
34872433	Effects of SPARCL1 on the proliferation and differentiation of sheep preadipocytes.	Important candidate genes that regulate lipid metabolism have the potential to increase the content of intramuscular fat (IMF) and improve meat quality. Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine like 1(SPARCL1) is a secreted glycoprotein with important physiological functions and is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of various cells. However, the role of the SPARCL1 gene in sheep preadipocytes and its regulatory mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we explored the effect of SPARCL1 on the proliferation and differentiation of sheep preadipocytes. The results showed that the expression level of the SPARCL1 gene is higher in fat tissue than in other tissues, and the gene was significantly increased on the 6th day of preadipocyte  differentiation. In the preadipocyte proliferation stage, interference of SPARCL1 gene reduced cell viability and increased cell apoptosis. In preadipocyte differentiation stage, SPARCL1 overexpression significantly inhibited lipid droplets accumulation and triglyceride content by increasing Wnt10b, Fzd8, IL6, and β-catenin and inhibiting PPARγ, C/EBPα, LPL, and IGF1 genes expression, whereas SPARCL1 deficiency significantly promoted cell differentiation by inhibiting β-catenin and increasing GSK3β, PPARγ, C/EBPα, and LPL. The results of this study suggest that SPARCL1 plays a negative role during preadipocyte differentiation and may become a novel target for regulating preadipocyte differentiation and improving IMF.Abbreviations: IMF: Intramuscular fat SPARCL1:  Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine like 1 PPARγ: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ C/EBPα: CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α LPL: Lipoprotein lipase IGF1: Insulin-like growth factor 1 Wnt10b: Wnt family member 10B Fzd8: Frizzled class receptor 8 IL6: Interleukin 6 β-catenin: Catenin beta interacting protein 1 GSK3β: Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta LRP5/6: Low-density  lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6.	0
35215417	Genetic Biomarkers of Metabolic Detoxification for Personalized Lifestyle Medicine.	Metabolic detoxification (detox)-or biotransformation-is a physiological function that removes toxic substances from our body. Genetic variability and dietary factors may affect the function of detox enzymes, thus impacting the body's sensitivity to toxic substances of endogenous and exogenous origin. From a genetic perspective, most of the current knowledge relies on observational studies in humans or experimental models in vivo and in vitro, with very limited  proof of causality and clinical value. This review provides health practitioners  with a list of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within genes involved in Phase I and Phase II detoxification reactions, for which evidence of  clinical utility does exist. We have selected these SNPs based on their association with interindividual variability of detox metabolism in response to certain nutrients in the context of human clinical trials. In order to facilitate clinical interpretation and usage of these SNPs, we provide, for each of them, a  strength of evidence score based on recent guidelines for genotype-based dietary  advice. We also present the association of these SNPs with functional biomarkers  of detox metabolism in a pragmatic clinical trial, the LIFEHOUSE study.	0
35104000	Polymorphisms and association of GRM1, GNAQ and HCRTR1 genes with seasonal reproduction and litter size in three sheep breeds.	Litter size is one of the important economic traits of livestock. Seasonal oestrus, ovulation and lambing of sheep have severely restricted the development  of sheep farming in Xinjiang, China. The purpose of this study was to investigate the polymorphisms and genetic correlation between GRM1, GNAQ and HCRTR1 genes and the seasonal reproduction and litter size in three sheep breeds. The DNA mixed pool sequencing and PCR-SSCP methods were used to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of GRM1, GNAQ and HCRTR1 genes in seasonal oestrous (Kazakh  and Chinese Merino [Xinjiang Junken type]) and perennial oestrous (Hu) sheep breeds. The association between genetic polymorphism and litter size was also analysed. The results showed that T945C in exon 2 of GRM1 gene, C589T in exon 2 of HCRTR1 gene and A191G in exon 2 of GNAQ gene were identified by Sanger sequencing, and three genotypes were existed in each SNP site, which all belonged to the synonymous mutation. GRM1 (CC), GNAQ (GA) and HCRTR1 (TC) were the dominant genotypes of seasonal reproduction and litter size in Kazakh sheep and Chinese Merino sheep, respectively, while, in perennial oestrous Hu sheep populations, the dominant genotypes were GRM1 (TC), GNAQ (GA) and HCRTR1 (TC), respectively, and association analysis also confirmed the results. The above results implied that GRM1, GNAQ and HCRTR1 genes are significantly associated with lambing traits in Kazakh, Chinese Merino and Hu sheep. Among them, the locus of GRM1 (T945C), GNAQ (A191G) and HCRTR1 (C589T) might be considered as a potential molecular marker, which controls seasonal reproduction and litter size  in sheep.	0
35125115	Insights into the role of major bioactive dietary nutrients in lamb meat quality: a review.	Feed supplementation with α-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA) increases their content in muscle, ALA increases n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and decrease n-6/n-3 ratio in muscle, and LA increases rumenic acid. However, high LA supplementation may have negative effects on lambs' lipid oxidative stability of  meat. When the sources of ALA and LA are fed as fresh forage, the negative effects are counterbalanced by the presence of other bioactive compounds, as vitamin E (mainly α-tocopherol) and polyphenols, which delay the lipid oxidation  in meat. There is a wide consensus on the capability of vitamin E delaying lipid  oxidation on lamb meat, and its feed content should be adjusted to the length of  supplementation. A high dietary inclusion of proanthocyanidins, phenolic compounds and terpenes reduce the lipid oxidation in muscle and may improve the shelf life of meat, probably as a result of a combined effect with dietary vitamin E. However, the recommended dietary inclusion levels depend on the polyphenol type and concentration and antioxidant capacity of the feedstuffs, which cannot be compared easily because no routine analytical grading methods are yet available. Unless phenolic compounds content in dietary ingredients/supplements for lambs are reported, no specific association with animal physiology responses may be established.	0
34485439	Association of DGAT1 With Cattle, Buffalo, Goat, and Sheep Milk and Meat Production Traits.	Milk fatty acids are essential for many dairy product productions, while intramuscular fat (IMF) is associated with the quality of meat. The triacylglycerols (TAGs) are the major components of IMF and milk fat. Therefore,  understanding the polymorphisms and genes linked to fat synthesis is important for animal production. Identifying quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and genes associated with milk and meat production traits has been the objective of various mapping studies in the last decade. Consistently, the QTLs on chromosomes 14, 15, and 9 have been found to be associated with milk and meat production traits in cattle, goat, and buffalo and sheep, respectively. Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) gene has been reported on chromosomes 14, 15, and 9 in cattle, goat, and buffalo and sheep, respectively. Being a key role in fat metabolism and TAG synthesis, the DGAT1 has obtained considerable attention especially in animal milk production. In addition to milk production, DGAT1 has also been a subject of interest in animal meat production. Several polymorphisms  have been documented in DGAT1 in various animal species including cattle, buffalo, goat, and sheep for their association with milk production traits. In addition, the DGAT1 has also been studied for their role in meat production traits in cattle, sheep, and goat. However, very limited studies have been conducted in cattle for association of DGAT1 with meat production traits in cattle. Moreover, not a single study reported the association of DGAT1 with meat  production traits in buffalo; thus, further studies are warranted to fulfill this huge gap. Keeping in view the important role of DGAT1 in animal production, the current review article was designed to highlight the major development and new insights on DGAT1 effect on milk and meat production traits in cattle, buffalo, sheep, and goat. Moreover, we have also highlighted the possible future contributions of DGAT1 for the studied species.	0
34372496	First Survey of SNPs in TMEM154, TLR9, MYD88 and CCR5 Genes in Sheep Reared in Italy and Their Association with Resistance to SRLVs Infection.	Maedi-visna virus (MVV) and caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV), referred to as small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs), belong to the genus Lentivirus of the  Retroviridae family. SRLVs infect both sheep and goats, causing significant economic losses and animal welfare damage. Recent findings suggest an association between serological status and allelic variants of different genes such as TMEM154, TLR9, MYD88 and CCR5. The aim of this work was to investigate the role of specific polymorphisms of these genes in SRLVs infection in some sheep flocks  in Italy. In addition to those already known, novel variants in the TMEM154 (P7H, I74V, I105V) gene were detected in this study. The risk of infection was determined finding an association between the serological status and polymorphisms P7H, E35K, N70I, I74V, I105V of TMEM154, R447Q, A462S and G520R in  TLR9 gene, H176H* and K190K* in MYD88 genes, while no statistical association was observed for the 4-bp deletion of the CCR5 gene. Since no vaccines or treatments  have been developed, a genetically based approach could be an innovative strategy to prevent and to control SRLVs infection. Our findings are an important starting point in order to define the genetic resistance profile towards SRLVs infection.	0
35433706	Integration Analysis of Transcriptome and Proteome Reveal the Mechanisms of Goat  Wool Bending.	Zhongwei goat is a unique Chinese native goat breed for excellent lamb fur. The pattern of flower spikes of the lamb fur was significantly reduced due to the reduction of the bending of the hair strands with growth. In order to explore the molecular mechanism underlying hair bending with growth, we performed the comprehensive analysis of transcriptome and proteome of skins from 45-days, 108-days and 365-days goat based on TMT-based quantitative proteomics and RNA-seq methods. In the three comparison groups, 356, 592 and 282 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were screened, respectively. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that DEPs were significantly enriched in a set of signaling pathways related to wool growth and bending, such as ECM-receptor interaction, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, PPAR signaling pathway, protein digestion and absorption, and  metabolic pathways. In addition, 20 DEPs abundance of goat skin at three development stages were examined by PRM method, which validated the reliability of proteomic data. Among them, KRT and collagen alpha family may play an important role in the development of goat hair follicle and wool bending. COL6A1, COL6A2, CRNN, TNC and LOC102178129 were identified as candidate genes based on combined analysis of transcriptome and proteome data and PRM quantification. Our  results identify the differential expressed proteins as well as pathways related  to the wool bending of Zhongwei goats and provide a theoretical basis for further revealing the molecular mechanism underlying wool bending of goats.	0
35219814	Variation in caprine KRTAP1-3 and its association with cashmere fibre diameter.	Keratin-associated proteins (KAPs) are components of cashmere fibres. The gene encoding the KAP1-3 protein (KRTAP1-3) has been described in goats, but little is known about sequence variation in this gene and if it affects cashmere fibre traits. In this study, we used a polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) technique to screen for nucleotide sequence  variation in caprine KRTAP1-3 in 327 Longdong cashmere goats, then analysed association between the genetic variation that was revealed and some cashmere fibre traits. Six PCR-SSCP patterns representing six different variant sequences  of KRTAP1-3 (named A to F) were revealed. Among these variant sequences, seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected, with two of them being non-synonymous. Goats with genotype AC had higher mean fibre diameter (MFD) than  those with genotype AB (P < 0.001), while goats with genotype AB had higher MFD than those with AA (P < 0.001). The presence of C (P < 0.001) and B (P = 0.006) in a genotype was associated with increased MFD, and together this suggests that  variation in caprine KRTAP1-3 affects the key fibre trait of MFD.	0
34489888	Genome Sequencing and Comparative Genomics of Indian Isolates of Brucella melitensis.	Brucella melitensis causes small ruminant brucellosis and a zoonotic pathogen prevalent worldwide. Whole genome phylogeny of all available B. melitensis genomes (n = 355) revealed that all Indian isolates (n = 16) clustered in the East Mediterranean lineage except the ADMAS-GI strain. Pangenome analysis indicated the presence of limited accessory genomes with few clades showing specific gene presence/absence pattern. A total of 43 virulence genes were predicted in all the Indian strains of B. melitensis except 2007BM-1 (ricA and wbkA are absent). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis indicated all except one Indian strain (ADMAS-GI) falling into sequence type (ST 8). In comparison with MLST, core genome phylogeny indicated two major clusters (>70% bootstrap support values) among Indian strains. Clusters with <70% bootstrap support values represent strains with diverse evolutionary origins present among animal and human hosts. Genetic relatedness among animal (sheep and goats) and human strains with 100% bootstrap values shows its zoonotic transfer potentiality. SNP-based analysis indicated similar clustering to that of core genome phylogeny. Among the Indian strains, the highest number of unique SNPs (112 SNPs) were shared by a node that involved three strains from Tamil Nadu. The node SNPs involved several  peptidase genes like U32, M16 inactive domain protein, clp protease family protein, and M23 family protein and mostly represented non-synonymous (NS) substitutions. Vaccination has been followed in several parts of the world to prevent small ruminant brucellosis but not in India. Comparison of Indian strains with vaccine strains showed that M5 is genetically closer to most of the Indian strains than Rev.1 strain. The presence of most of the virulence genes among all  Indian strains and conserved core genome compositions suggest the use of any circulating strain/genotypes for the development of a vaccine candidate for small ruminant brucellosis in India.	0
34159253	An investigation of the effects of BMPR1B, BMP15, and GDF9 genes on litter size in Ramlıç and Dağlıç sheep.	This study was carried out to determine the presence of polymorphisms in genes affecting litter size. The SNPs in bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 1B (BMPR1B), bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP15), and growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) genes were detected in 60 uniparous and 60 multiparous ewes from  Ramlıç and Dağlıç breeds. The ewes are maintained in nine public herds at the breeding station of the Afyonkarahisar Sheep and Goats Breeders' Association and  lambed in two consecutive breeding seasons. PCR and DNA sequencing analyses were  conducted, and 36, 4, and 11 SNPs in Ramlıç and 40, 3, and 11 SNPs in Dağlıç were detected in BMPR1B, BMP15, and GDF9 genes, respectively. A total of 16 SNPs in Ramlıç and 10 SNPs in Dağlıç breeds for three genes were found to be significant  ( P < 0.05 ). The resulting analyses showed that four SNPs (g.49496G>A, c.1658A>C, c.2037C>T, c.2053C>T) of the BMPR1B gene and one deletion mutation (c.28_30delCTT) in the BMP15 gene of the Ramlıç breed as well as five SNPs (c.1487C>A, c.2492C>T, c.2523G>A, c.2880A>G, and c.2763G>A) of the BMPR1B gene of the Dağlıç breed have significant positive regression coefficients in the desired direction of the rare allele. The observed mutations have potential to be used as genetic markers in the selection of prolific animals for both breeds.	0
34747683	Association analysis for SNPs of KRT26 and TCHH genes with cashmere production performance, body measurement traits and milk production traits in Liaoning cashmere goats.	Cashmere fineness is getting thicker, which is one of the key problems in cashmere breeding, however, there have been no systematic studies on the molecular regulation of cashmere fineness. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between KRT26 and TCHH gene polymorphism and production performance in Liaoning cashmere goats (LCG). The potential single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of LCG were detected by sequence alignment and PCR-Seq polymorphism of KRT26 and TCHH genes and analyzed the effect of SNPs on production performance by SPSS software. Two SNPs sites (A559T and A6839G) of two genes were detected. The AA genotype of KRT26 A559T locus was the dominant genotype. AG and GG at TCHH A6839G locus were the dominant genotypes. AAAA was the dominant haplotype combination. The results showed that KRT26 and TCHH genes  were associated with cashmere fineness of LCG, and A559T (AA) and A6839G (GG) genotypes were the preferred marker genotypes for cashmere fineness, which provided more theoretical basis for further research on cashmere fineness.	0
34626930	Evaluation of candidate point mutation of Kisspeptin 1 gene associated with litter size in Indian Goat breeds and its effect on transcription factor binding  sites.	Kisspeptin gene (Kiss1) has a significant role in reproductive processes in mammals. However, only little information is available about the association of Kiss1 gene with litter size in Indian goat breeds. Thus, blood samples from 285 randomly selected animals were collected for DNA isolation and SNP profiling. The PCR product of 242 bp size harboring g.2540C>T mutation of Kiss1 gene was digested with the restriction enzyme Sac1. Least squares analysis revealed that Barbari goats showed significantly higher average litter size (2.86±0.08) compared to Beetal, Sirohi and Sojat breeds (P < 0.01). SNP locus g.2540C>T of Kiss1 gene also showed significant effect on litter size (P < 0.01). Goats with Genotype CT (2.66 ± 0.07) and TT (2.67 ± 0.26) had significantly higher (P < 0.01) litter size than CC (1.50 ± 0.05). From the transcription factor binding site analysis, it was predicted that due to g.2540C>T SNP, both native and mutant variant forms coded for putative binding sites for different transcription Factor. Allele T had putative binding sites for the androgen receptor which plays a significant role in the signaling pathway involved in increase in ovulation rate; which consequently can have a tremendous effect on average litter size.	0
35092859	Genome-wide detection of selective signals for fecundity traits in goats (Capra hircus).	Fecundity in livestock is an economically important complex quantitative trait that is influenced by both genetics and the environment. However, the underlying  genetic mechanism of reproductive performance in goats has not been well investigated. To investigate the genomic basis of fecundity in goats, genomic sequencing data of the Jining grey goat (a high prolificacy breed in China) were  collected, as well as data for other commonly available goat breeds, and a mass of genomic variants were generated after variation calling. We screened the Jining grey goat (20 individuals) using a selective sweep with the Asian wild goat population (5 individuals), and potential candidate genes were proposed, such as STIM1, ESR1, LRRC14B and SLC9A3. Among, STIM1 is a most promising one associated with high reproductive capacity. When compared to Chinese domestic goats with low fecundity (17 individuals), the genes including MLLT10, SPIRE2, TCF25, ZNF276 and FANCA were screened, and the SPIRE2 gene was thought to be associated with fecundity traits. Meanwhile, the functional enrichment of these candidate genes revealed that they were involved in biological processes of mammary gland morphogenesis, uterus development, gastrulation, mesoderm morphogenesis and formation, and blood vessel development, which might undergo natural or artificial selection during reproductive trait formation in goats. Thus, our findings could enrich the genetic basis of reproductive trait selection during goat domestication, which may serve to improve goat breeding practices.	0
35359681	Crossing the Line: Seroprevalence and Risk Factors for Transboundary Animal Diseases Along the Tanzania-Zambia Border.	Transboundary pathogens pose a threat to livelihood security in countries such as Zambia and Tanzania. This study aimed to investigate the seroprevalence of peste  des petits ruminants virus (PPRV), foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), sheep and goat pox virus (SGPV), Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and Brucella spp. in sheep  and goats along the Tanzania-Zambia border. Another aim was to assess the association between certain predictor variables and seroprevalence, focusing on trade and proximity to an international border, to a town and to the Tanzania-Zambia highway. During September-October 2018, 486 serum samples from small ruminants in Zambia and 491 in Tanzania were collected and analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). A questionnaire focused on management strategies was administered to each household. The animal-level seroprevalence in Zambia was 0.21% [95% confidence interval (CI) (0.01-1.14) for PPRV, 1.03% (95% CI 0.33-2.39) for FMDV, 0% (95% CI 0-0.76) for SGPV, 2.26% (95% CI 1.14-4.01) for RVFV and 1.65% (95% CI 0.71-3.22) for Brucella spp.]. In Tanzania, animal-level seroprevalence was 2.85% (95% CI 1.57-4.74) for PPRV, 16.9% (95% CI 13.7-20.5) for FMDV, 0.20% (95% CI 0.01-1.13) for SGPV, 3.26% (95% CI 1.87-5.24) for RVFV and 20.0% (95% CI 14.5-26.5) for Brucella spp. For PPRV (OR 6.83, 95% CI 1.37-34.0, p = 0.019) and FMDV (OR 5.68, 95% CI 1.58-20.3, p = 0.008), herds situated more than 30 km from an international border were more likely to be seropositive, while being located 10-30 km (OR 4.43, 95% CI 1.22-16.1 p = 0.024)  from a border was identified as a risk factor for Brucella spp. For FMDV (OR 79.2, 95% CI 4.52-1388.9, p = 0.003), being situated within 30 km from a town was associated with seropositivity. Furthermore, contact with wild ruminants (OR 18.2, 95% CI 1.36-244), and the presence of sheep in the household (OR 5.20, 95%  CI 1.00-26.9, p = 0.049), was associated with seropositivity for PPRV, and FMDV.  No significant associations between trade or distance to the Tan-Zam highway and  seroprevalence were found. We recommend that the impact of trade and proximity to borders, towns and roads should be further evaluated in larger studies, ideally incorporating aspects such as temporal trade fluctuations.	0
34474792	Eleven years of Toxoplasma gondii serological follow-up in a goat herd and association of toxoplasmosis with reproductive losses.	Toxoplasmosis is considered one of the most important causes of abortion in small ruminants. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between Toxoplasma gondii antibody titres and reproductive losses over an 11 year period  in a goat farm located in Buenos Aires province, Argentina. Blood samples were obtained from 85 goats, representing three breeds, during the last third of gestation (n = 165 gestations), in consecutive pregnancies (2008-2019), and from  51 goats during kidding to analyze seroconversion. Serum was evaluated by IFAT with T. gondii antigen, using 1:100 dilution as the cut-off titre and processed to end titre. An overall reproductive loss of 31% (51/165) was detected, including 16.4% (27/165) abortions and 14.6% (24/165) perinatal deaths. The seropositivity to T. gondii was 100% (85/85) with all animals positive in successive samplings and, therefore, considered chronically infected. Antibody titres showed average values greater than 1100 in each year and breed group. Differences in antibody levels were associated with breed and were lower in those that were predominately Creole and higher in those that were predominately Saanen. Seroconversion was detected in 16.2% (6/37) and 57.1% (8/14) of goats from the Creole and Sannen breed groups, respectively. There were no significant  differences in the antibody titre average between goats with reproductive losses  and those with healthy kids, although the goats with perinatal deaths had a significantly higher titre average. These results suggest reinfection or reactivation, although no association with reproductive losses was observed. Higher antibody titres were associated with perinatal deaths. The high T. gondii  antibody titres in a farm with 100% seroprevalence did not allow for association  with reproductive losses, particularly abortion, to be assessed.	0
34566313	Association of the KiSS1 gene with litter size in Cyprus and Iraqi black goats.	AIM: The study investigated the genetic polymorphism of the kisspeptin (KiSS1) gene and its relationship with litter size in Cyprus and Iraqi black goats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples (n=124) were collected from the two goat breeds reared at the Agricultural Research-Ruminant Research Station Breeding Station, Baghdad, Iraq. Genomic DNA was isolated using a DNA extraction kit. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the KiSS1 gene. All PCR products were sequenced and samples were used for further analysis using NCBI-Blast online on the exon 1 (595 bp) region of the KiSS1 gene. RESULTS: The results of this study revealed a significantly (P<0.05) larger litter size of the Cyprus goat breed than in the Iraqi black goats in the first and second parity. Three (893G/C, 973C/A, and 979T/G) substitutions relative to the KiSS1 gene reference sequence (GenBank ID: J × 047312.1, KC989928.1) were identified. Only the mutation g893G>C was identified as a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated with litter size. Furthermore, the average alleles  in KiSS1 gene of both types of goats 0.567 and 0.3715 GG, were recorded. The genotyping at locus g893C>G was demonstrating domination of fecundity quality litter size, Both genotypes SNP of GC were classified at this marked region of KiSS1 gene. CONCLUSION: The study concluded that the role of the KiSS1 gene in fecundity, revealing the status of this gene as an indicator in the assisted of caprine breeding selection.	0
34364641	Distribution of somatic cell count and udder pathogens in Norwegian dairy goats.	Compared with dairy cows, goat somatic cell count (SCC) is higher and probably more affected by physiological factors such as parity, stage of lactation, and season. Thus, SCC is believed to be a less precise indicator of intramammary infections in dairy goats, and no consensus exists on SCC thresholds for considering goats as infected. The Norwegian Goat Recording System maintains individual goat production records and results from microbiological analyses of milk samples. In this retrospective observational study, we used recordings over  a 10-yr period (2010 to 2020) to describe the association between individual goat SCC and noninfectious factors, as well as intramammary infections. The median SCC in the 1,000,802 milk recordings included in the study was 440,000 cells/mL, and  the mode was 70,000 cells/mL. Somatic cell count increased with parity, days in milk, estrus, pasture season, and intramammary infections. The effect of parity and stage of lactation was significantly higher in infected compared with uninfected goats. Staphylococci dominated as causes of intramammary infections, with Staphylococcus aureus as the udder pathogen associated with highest SCC. The most prevalent non-aureus staphylococci were Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus caprae. This study provides guidelines for interpretation of goat SCC at different parities and stages of lactations under Norwegian management conditions. We revealed a considerable variation in SCC associated with physiological factors, indicating that the cutoff for identifying infected goats should be a dynamic threshold adjusted for  parity, stage of lactation, and season.	0
35327177	Preliminary Investigation of Mixed Orchard Hays on the Meat Quality, Fatty Acid Profile, and Gastrointestinal Microbiota in Goat Kids.	This preliminary investigation was designed to study the effects of different mixed orchard hays on meat quality, fatty acids, amino acids, rumen intestinal microflora, and the relationship between rumen bacteria and fatty acids in the longissimus dorsi muscle of Saanen dairy goats. In this preliminary investigation, goats were separately fed crop straws (corn and wheat straws) and  alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) (CK group), alfalfa + oats (Avena sativa L.) (group  I), alfalfa + perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) (group II), and hairy vetch  (Vicia villosa Roth.) + perennial ryegrass (group III). There were differences in shear force and cooking loss between treatments. The contents of saturated fatty  acids (SFAs) C14:0, C16:0, and C18:0 in the CK group were significantly higher than those in other three groups (p &lt; 0.001). The 16S rDNA sequencing results  showed that the relative abundance of Proteobacteria in group II were higher than those in other three groups (p &lt; 0.05). Association analysis showed that Prevotella_1 was negatively correlated with C18:0 and significantly positively correlated with C16:1, while Clostridium and Romboutsia showed a positive correlation with monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Therefore, feeding mixed hays can increase beneficial fatty acids  and the percentages of associated bacteria in rumen and intestines.	0
34765142	Genome-wide selective detection of Mile red-bone goat using next-generation sequencing technology.	The ecotype population of goats (Capra hircus) was created by long-term artificial selection and natural adaptation. Mile red-bone goat is an indigenous  breed with visible red bones, and its special bone structure has received extensive attention. This study aimed to identify genetic variants and candidate  genes associated with specific bone phenotypes using next-generation sequencing technology (NGS). The results revealed that 31,828,206 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained from 72 goats (20 Mile red-bone goats and 52 common goats) by NGS. A total of 100 candidate genes were identified on the basis top 1% window interaction from nucleotide diversity (π), π ratio (π A/π B), and pairwise fixation index (F ST). Exactly 77 known signaling pathways were enriched. Specifically, three coding genes (NMNAT2, LOC102172983, and PNLIP) were annotated in the vitamin metabolism signaling pathways, and NCF2 was annotated to the osteoclast (OC) differentiation pathway. Furthermore, 5862 reliable copy number variations (CNVs) were obtained, and 14 and 24 genes were annotated with the top 1‰ CNV based on F ST (>0.490) and V ST (>0.527), respectively. Several pathways related to bone development and metabolism of exogenous substances in vivo, including calcium signaling pathway, OC differentiation, and glycerophospholipid metabolism, were annotated. Specifically, six genes from 19 candidate CNVs, which were obtained by interaction of the top 1‰ CNVs with F ST and V ST, were annotated to mucin-type O-glycan biosynthesis and metabolic pathways. Briefly, the results implied that pseudopurpurin and specific genetic variants work together to contribute to the red-bone color and specific bone structure of Mile red-bone goat. This study is helpful to understanding the genetic basis of the unique bone phenotype of Mile red-bone goats.	0
34749304	Nontyphoidal Salmonella among Children under 5 Years Old in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study.	Factors associated with nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) infection have not been well characterized to date. We aimed to compare the associated factors among children under age 5 years with NTS infection in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Data from children having moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) and asymptomatic children with NTS isolated from fecal specimens were extracted from  the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), conducted from December 2007 to March 2011. Compared with NTS-negative children, NTS-associated MSD cases in South Asia were associated with the presence of goat in the house (adjusted odds  ratio [aOR]: 2.15; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25-3.70) and handwashing after handling an animal (aOR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.36-3.74). In sub-Saharan Africa, children with NTS associated MSD had a greater association with stunting (1.21 95% CI: 1.01-1.45), longer duration of diarrhea (aOR: 1.25 95% CI: 1.19-1.31); presence of cow in house (aOR: 1.54 95% CI: 1.09-2.16), handwashing after handling animal (aOR: 2.41 95% CI: 1.74-3.33). Drinking tube well water (aOR: 0.54 95% CI: 0.32-0.91), availability of toilet facility (aOR: 0.58 95% CI: 0.53-0.65), and handwashing before eating (aOR: 0.76 95% CI: 0.57-1.00) and after defecation (aOR: 0.80 95% CI: 0.69, 0.94) were found to be protective. The differentials between children of both regions having fecal NTS are distinct and  underscore the need for policymaking for preventive and control strategies targeting stunted children.	0
34206971	Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Genes Encoding Toll-Like Receptors 7 and 8 and Their Association with Proviral Load of SRLVs in Goats of Polish Carpathian Breed.	Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7 and 8 are important in single-stranded viral RNA recognition, so genetic variation of these genes may play a role in SRLVs infection and disease progression. Present study aimed to identify SNPs in genes  encoding TLR7 and TLR8 in goats of Carpathian breed and analyze their association with the SRLVs provirus concentration as index of disease progression. A total of 14 SNPs were detected, 6 SNPs in the TLR7 gene locus and 8 SNPs in the TLR8 gene. Nine of the 14 identified polymorphisms, 4 in the TLR7 gene and 5 in TLR8 gene, were significantly associated with the SRLVs proviral concentration. These SNPs were located in 3'UTR, 5'UTR and intron sequences as well as in the coding sequences, but they led to silent changes. Homozygous genotypes of three TLR7 SNPs (synonymous variant 1:50703293, 3'UTR variant 1:50701297 and 5'UTR variant 1:50718645) were observed in goats with lower provirus copy number as well as in  seronegative animals. The results obtained in this study suggest that SNPs of TLR7/TLR8 genes may induce differential innate immune response towards SRLVs affecting proviral concentration and thereby disease pathogenesis and progression. These findings support a role for genetic variations of TLR7 and TLR8 in SRLVs infection and warrants further studies on the effect of TLR7/TLR8 polymorphisms on SRLVs infection in different populations.	0
34438843	Thyroid and Lipidic Profiles in Nicastrese Goats (Capra hircus) during Pregnancy  and Postpartum Period.	This study aimed to determine the thyroid and lipid profiles in 30 Nicastrese goats, along different physiological periods: before mating (nonpregnant goats),  during the whole pregnancy (pregnant goats), and during postpartum and early lactation (milking goats). Blood samples were collected monthly from March 2020 to January 2021. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), total and free triiodothyronine (T3, fT3), and thyroxine (T4, fT4) concentrations were measured  using immunoenzymatic assay kits and serum lipid panels (triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (tCho)) by enzymatic colorimetric method; very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL Cho) was calculated. Pregnant and milking goats showed the lower T3 (p < 0.0002) and T4 (p < 0.0005) concentrations, with lower BCS (p < 0.001) only in pregnant ones. Milking goats showed tCho (p < 0.006) concentrations lower than nonpregnant ones, and TG and VLDL Cho (p < 0.001) lower than both pregnant and nonpregnant goats. T4:T3 and T3:fT3 were significantly and positively correlated in both pregnancy and lactation. Under similar environmental, nutrition, and management conditions, different physiological phases play a significant role in the thyroid and lipid profiles in Nicastrese goats. These endocrine and metabolic resources could contribute to the knowledge  useful for the salvage of this endangered, local, native breed.	0
34854798	Distribution of DGAT1 copy number variation in Chinese goats and its associations with milk production traits.	Goat is an important sector for meat and dairy products. Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), which is a key gene in milk production, has been recently detected to overlap with a novel copy number variation (CNV) in goats. CNVs could be genetic markers providing new insights into the genetic basis of phenotypic variation. Up to now, there are no reports on the DGAT1-related CNV (DGAT1 CNV) in Chinese goats. This study first detected the distribution of the DGAT1 CNV in Chinese seven goat breeds, finding substantial differences among dairy, meat, and fiber goats (P < 0.01). The association analysis between the DGAT1 CNV and milk production traits revealed significant associations: Xinong Sannen (XS) dairy goat with copy number loss type had higher freezing point depression (FPD) (P < 0.01) and milk solids-not-fat (SNF) content (P < 0.05). Overall, our study unraveled the distribution of DGAT1 CNV in Chinese goats for the first time and found the potential role of this CNV in the marker-assisted selection of dairy goat breeding.	0
34350222	Effect of Weeping Teats on Intramammary Infection and Somatic Cell Score in Dairy Goats.	"Mastitis is the most common disease affecting dairy goats and causing economic losses. Although it is accepted that increased somatic cell count (SCC) is mainly a response to infection, its reliability for subclinical mastitis detection in goats is controversial. Indeed, many physiological and extrinsic variables can increase SCC, including breed, parity, age, stage of lactation, seasonal variations, and milking methods. In some animals, milk-secreting tissue is present in the wall of the teat and, in some instances, milk can filter through pores in the skin to the udder surface. This condition is known as ""weeping teat"" (WT). In these animals, mammary tissue might be prone to develop bacterial infections, although limited information is provided. Weeping teat seems to have  a genetic background and is reported to be especially found in goat breeds selected for high milk production. Moreover, it is observed a genetic correlation between WT and decreased milk yield as well as increased somatic cell scores (SCS). Since information on this topic is very limited, this study aimed at investigating any possible relationship between WT, high SCC, and the presence of bacteria in goat milk. Alpine goat farms in Northern Italy were selected based on the presence of WT. Each herd was divided into two age-matched groups, identified as case (WT+) and control (WT-). Half-udder milk samples were collected aseptically at three timepoints; bacteriological analysis was performed, and SCC  were determined and transformed in SCS. There was a positive association between  SCS and the presence of bacteria in milk (P = 0.037) overall, whereas WT udder defect was associated with positive bacterial culture in just one herd (P = 0.053). Thus, this herd was further investigated, repeating the sampling and the  analysis on the following year. The positive association between high SCS and the presence of bacteria in milk was then confirmed (P = 0.007), whereas no association with WT condition was found. These results indicate that WT defect is usually unrelated to both the outcome of milk bacterial culture and SCS. As a side outcome, we could confirm the role of bacterial infection in increasing SCS."	0
34696389	Risk Factors Associated with the Alpine Multispecies Farming System in the Eradication of CAEV in South Tyrol, Italy.	South Tyrol has implemented, in 2007, a mandatory eradication program against Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis Virus (CAEV), a virus known to cause economic losses related to decreases in milk production and milk quality in goats, along with poor animal welfare and premature death. After a great initial decrease in the seroprevalence, the program has reached a tailing phase with scattered positivities. Potential risk factors associated with the multispecies farming system, a traditional approach in South Tyrol, are evaluated in this study, in order to better understand some of the potential causes leading to the tailing phenomenon. A statistically significant number of farms was selected for the present study, based on the risk factors evaluated. Even though there is no statistically significant association between the practices evaluated and the incidence of infection, the authors believe that it is important to highlight potential risks that may threaten the outcome of this eradication program.	0
34484167	Dodecapeptide Cathelicidins of Cetartiodactyla: Structure, Mechanism of Antimicrobial Action, and Synergistic Interaction With Other Cathelicidins.	In this study, dodecapeptide cathelicidins were shown to be widespread antimicrobial peptides among the Cetruminantia clade. In particular, we investigated the dodecapeptide from the domestic goat Capra hircus, designated as ChDode and its unique ortholog from the sperm whale Physeter catodon (PcDode). ChDode contains two cysteine residues, while PcDode consists of two dodecapeptide building blocks and contains four cysteine residues. The recombinant analogs of the peptides were obtained by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli cells.  The structures of the peptides were studied by circular dichroism (CD), FTIR, and NMR spectroscopy. It was demonstrated that PcDode adopts a β-hairpin structure in water and resembles β-hairpin antimicrobial peptides, while ChDode forms a β-structural antiparallel covalent dimer, stabilized by two intermonomer disulfide bonds. Both peptides reveal a significant right-handed twist about 200  degrees per 8 residues. In DPC micelles ChDode forms flat β-structural tetramers  by antiparallel non-covalent association of the dimers. The tetramers incorporate into the micelles in transmembrane orientation. Incorporation into the micelles and dimerization significantly diminished the amplitude of backbone motions of ChDode at the picosecond-nanosecond timescale. When interacting with negatively charged membranes containing phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG), the ChDode peptide adopted similar oligomeric structure and was capable to form ion-conducting pores without membrane lysis. Despite modest antibacterial activity of ChDode, a considerable synergistic effect of this peptide in combination with another goat cathelicidin - the α-helical peptide ChMAP-28 was observed. This effect is based on an increase in permeability of bacterial membranes. In turn, this mechanism can lead to an increase in the efficiency of the combined action of the synergistic pair ChMAP-28 with the Pro-rich peptide mini-ChBac7.5Nα targeting the bacterial ribosome.	0
34307087	Patellar luxation in Hejazi goats.	Background: Patellar luxation (PL) is a common orthopedic affection among farm and pet animals with mostly congenital (environmental and/or genetic) background. Aim: We report here the first observation of lateral PL in Hejazi goats bred in Libya. Methods: Five Hejazi goats aged between 4 months and 2 years with severe hind limb lameness were admitted to Al-Sorouh veterinary clinic in Tripoli during the  period from 2016 to 2018. The goats were thoroughly examined clinically and radiographically. Two goats were surgically treated, and the other three cases were not because of either the cost limitation or expected poor prognosis. The surgical intervention involved femoral trochlear sulcoplasty, medial joint capsule imbrication, and tibial tuberosity transposition. Results: The clinical examination showed grade III-IV lateral PL. Radiologically, there were unilateral or bilateral, ventrocaudal, and dorsal PLs. Two cases were  referred to surgical correction. One case almost restored the normal movement of  stifle joint together with a good general status 1 year postsurgery. However, the surgical treatment was not effective in correcting the luxated patella in the second case. Conclusion: Lateral PL is common among orthopedic affections in Hejazi goats in Libya, and its surgical treatment provided a quite convenient approach. An association between inbreeding and the PL was suggested in those cases.	0
34255980	The InDel variants of sheep IGF2BP1 gene are associated with growth traits.	Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) plays positive roles in the growth, proliferation of cells and early embryos development by binding mRNA targets. Recently, it had been shown that some polymorphic loci within IGF2BP1 gene were associated with growth traits in animals, especially in  goats. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that some variants within IGF2BP1 gene may be also involved in growth traits of sheep. Nine insertion/deletion (InDel) mutations within IGF2BP1 were identified and three loci were polymorphic. Meanwhile, the association analyses between three InDels and growth traits were carried out in 745 sheep. The results showed that all InDels included 5 bp InDel  in downstream region, 9 bp InDel in intron 4 and 15 bp InDel in intron 2 within IGF2BP1 were significantly associated with growth traits (p<.05). Furthermore, at 5 and 9 bp InDel loci, the individuals of heterozygous genotype (ID) had superior growing performance especially at body weight (BW). In all, three InDels were crucial variants correlated with growth traits and could be applied in marker-assisted selection (MAS) in sheep.	0
34291885	Comparison of mtDNA control region among descendant breeds of the extinct Zaupel  sheep revealed haplogroup C and D in Central Europe.	The consideration of the descendance is indispensable in the preservation of endangered animal breeds. The authors compared mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control  region sequence in three descendant breeds of the extinct Zaupel sheep, firstly.  Their investigation was carried out in order to prove the common origin of Waldschaf (Austria), Bovec sheep (Slovenia) and Cikta (Hungary). A total of 118 biological samples were taken from non-related representatives of the three breeds between 2015 and 2017. A newly designed primer pair was also used to amplify the segment (1180 bp) to be tested. The total number of haplotypes in the whole study population was 49. The majority of which fell into haplogroup B. The  significant negative value of the Fu's Fs statistic (Fs statistic = -3.296, p = 0.013) based on haplotype frequencies demonstrated a moderate foreign gene flow. As a novel observation haplogroups C and D appeared in Cikta and Bovec sheep, respectively. The Tajima D-test value in the entire study population was -0.914 (p > 0.10), meaning that the separation of the three descendant breeds did not cause genetic drift, these are collectively in genetic equilibrium. The genetic information confirmed the common origin of the breeds known from the breed history.	0
35172715	Time-course RNA-seq analysis reveals stage-specific and melatonin-triggered gene  expression patterns during the hair follicle growth cycle in Capra hircus.	BACKGROUND: Cashmere goat is famous for its high-quality fibers. The growth of cashmere in secondary hair follicles exhibits a seasonal pattern arising from circannual changes in the natural photoperiod. Although several studies have compared and analyzed the differences in gene expression between different hair follicle growth stages, the selection of samples in these studies relies on research experience or morphological evidence. Distinguishing hair follicle growth cycle according to gene expression patterns may help to explore the regulation mechanisms related to cashmere growth and the effect of melatonin from a molecular level more accurately. RESULTS: In this study, we applied RNA-sequencing to the hair follicles of three  normal and three melatonin-treated Inner Mongolian cashmere goats sampled every month during a whole hair follicle growth cycle. A total of 3559 and 988 genes were subjected as seasonal changing genes (SCGs) in the control and treated groups, respectively. The SCGs in the normal group were divided into three clusters, and their specific expression patterns help to group the hair follicle  growth cycle into anagen, catagen and telogen stages. Some canonical pathways such as Wnt, TGF-beta and Hippo signaling pathways were detected as promoting the hair follicle growth, while Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Jak-STAT, Fc epsilon RI, NOD-like receptor, Rap1, PI3K-Akt, cAMP, NF-kappa B and many immune-related pathways were detected in the catagen and telogen stages. The PI3K-Akt signaling, ECM-receptor interaction and Focal adhesion were found in the transition stage between telogen to anagen, which may  serve as candidate biomarkers for telogen-anagen regeneration. A total of 16 signaling pathways, 145 pathway mRNAs, and 93 lncRNAs were enrolled to construct  the pathway-mRNA-lncRNA network, which indicated the function of lncRNAs through  interacting with their co-expressed mRNAs. Pairwise comparisons between the control and melatonin-treated groups also indicated 941 monthly differentially expressed genes (monthly DEGs). These monthly DEGs were mainly distributed from April and September, which revealed a potential signal pathway map regulating the anagen stage triggered by melatonin. Enrichment analysis showed that Wnt, Hedgehog, ECM, Chemokines and NF-kappa B signaling pathways may be involved in the regulation of non-quiescence and secondary shedding under the influence of melatonin. CONCLUSIONS: Our study decoded the key regulators of the whole hair follicle growth cycle, laying the foundation for the control of hair follicle growth and improvement of cashmere yield.	0
34856818	Listeria monocytogenes at the interface between ruminants and humans: A comparative pathology and pathogenesis review.	The bacterium Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is widely distributed in the environment as a saprophyte, but may turn into a lethal intracellular pathogen upon ingestion. Invasive infections occur in numerous species worldwide, but most commonly in humans and farmed ruminants, and manifest as distinct forms. Of those, neuroinfection is remarkably threatening due to its high mortality. Lm is  widely studied not only as a pathogen but also as an essential model for intracellular infections and host-pathogen interactions. Many aspects of its ecology and pathogenesis, however, remain unclear and are rarely addressed in its natural hosts. This review highlights the heterogeneity and adaptability of Lm by summarizing its association with the environment, farm animals, and disease. It also provides current knowledge on key features of the pathology and (molecular)  pathogenesis of various listeriosis forms in naturally susceptible species with a special focus on ruminants and on the neuroinvasive form of the disease. Moreover, knowledge gaps on pathomechanisms of listerial infections and relevant  unexplored topics in Lm pathogenesis research are highlighted.	0
34220107	Study on bacterial pathogens through multiplex polymerase chain reaction system and their antimicrobial resistance pattern in goats presumed with fever and/or diarrhea.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Goat is one of the major livestock species, plays an important role in the economy of Bangladesh. However, the outbreak of different infectious diseases in goats causes high mortality and economic losses due to lack of proper diagnosis and treatment. Conventional culture-based methods for detecting specific pathogens as confirmatory diagnosis are laborious as well as time-consuming in comparison to multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR), by which multiple pathogens can be detected at a time. The present study was aimed to perform faster molecular identification of bacterial pathogens from goats presumed with fever and/or diarrhea and their antimicrobial resistance (AMR) pattern. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 200 blood samples were collected from goats at  S. A. Quaderi Teaching Veterinary Hospital (SAQTVH) in Chattogram Veterinary and  Animal Sciences University for the period of July 2017-April 2018. DNA was extracted and subsequently, mPCR assay was performed for the screening of several bacterial pathogens (Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, Clostridium perfringens, Vibrio cholerae, and Staphylococcus aureus). An antimicrobial susceptibility test against ten antimicrobials for positive samples of each organism was conducted using the Kirby-Bauer Disk-Diffusion Method on selective media. RESULTS: S. aureus, C. perfringens, L. monocytogenes, and Salmonella spp. were detected from collected samples and their overall prevalence was 11.5%, 3.5%, 1%, and 20.5%, respectively. The most common clinical signs were mild fever, nasal discharge, dyspnea, and coughing (39.1%) for S. aureus, diarrhea, convulsion, abdominal pain, and incoordination (57.1%) for C. perfringens, fever, protrusion  of tongue, and incoordination (100%) for L. monocytogenes, and fever, anorexia, dehydration with mucous feces (36.6%) for Salmonella spp. infection in goats. AntimGentamicinicrobial diagram of S. aureus showed resistance against Cefotaxime (74%), Cefixime (65%), and Tetracycline (65%); highly sensitive against Amoxicillin (48%), Ciprofloxacin (44%), and Gentamicin (44%). On the other hand,  C. perfringens showed highly resistant against Ampicillin (71%), Gentamicin (71%), sensitive against Penicillin (57%), and Cefotaxime (57%). L. monocytogenes were found to be sensitive to Penicillin (100%) and Cefixime (100%) and Salmonella spp. showed resistance to Ampicillin (78%) and Amoxicillin (59%) but sensitive to Ciprofloxacin (54%). CONCLUSION: This study identified pathogens with their specific clinical signs in goats presumed fever and/or diarrhea through mPCR with their AMR pattern in SAQTVH, Chattogram. Potential risk factors, measuring the strength of association of disease caused by these particular pathogens, were also determined. mPCR may use as an effective tool for rapid detection of pathogens in animal.	0
34438796	Polymorphisms of Codons 110, 146, 211 and 222 at the Goat PRNP Locus and Their Association with Scrapie in Greece.	Scrapie is considered an endemic disease in both sheep and goats in Greece. However, contrary to sheep, in goats more than one prion protein (PrP) polymorphism has been recognized as a candidate for resistance breeding against the disease. For an impression, candidates which are circulating, (i) brain samples (n = 525) from scrapie-affected (n = 282) and non-affected (n = 243) animals within the national surveillance program, and (ii) individual blood samples (n = 1708) from affected (n = 241) and non-affected (n = 1467) herds, in  a large part of mainland Greece and its islands, were collected and assayed. A dedicated Taqman method was used to test for amino acid polymorphisms 110T/P, 146N/S/D, 211R/Q, and 222Q/K. Highly prevalent genotypes were 110TT, 146NN, 211RR, and 222QQ. The frequencies of polymorphisms in blood and negative brain samples for codons 110P, 211Q, and 222K were 4.0%, 3.0%, and 1.9%, respectively,  while 146D (0.7%) was present only on Karpathos island. Codon 110P was exclusively found in scrapie-negative brains, and homozygous 110P/P in two scrapie-negative goats. It is concluded that breeding programs in Karpathos could focus on codon 146D, while in other regions carriers of the 110P and 222K allele  should be sought. Case-control and challenge studies are now necessary to elucidate the most efficient breeding strategies.	0
34359192	Detection of 15-bp Deletion Mutation within PLAG1 Gene and Its Effects on Growth  Traits in Goats.	Stature and weight are important growth and development traits for animals, which also significantly affect the productivity of livestock. Polymorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1) is located in the growth-related quantitative trait nucleotides (QTN),  and its variation has been determined to significantly affect the body stature of bovines. This study found that novel 15-bp InDel could significantly influence important growth traits in goats. The frequencies of genotypes of the 15-bp mutation and relationship with core growth traits such as body weight, body height, height at hip cross, chest circumference, hip width and body index were explored in 1581 individuals among 4 Chinese native goat breeds. The most frequent genotypes of Shaanbei white Cashmere goat (SWCG), Inner Mongolia White Cashmere goat (IMCG) and Guanzhong Dairy goat (GZDG) were II genotypes (insertion/insertion), and the frequency of ID genotype (insertion/deletion) was  found to be slightly higher than that of II genotype in Hainan Black goat (HNBG), showing that the frequency of the I allele was higher than that of the D allele.  In adult goats, there were significant differences between 15-bp variation and body weight, chest circumference and body height traits in SWCG (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the locus was also found to be significantly correlated with the body index of HNBG (p = 0.044) and hip width in GZDG (p = 0.002). In regard to lambs, there were significant differences in height at the hip cross of SWCG (p = 0.036) and hip width in IMWC (p = 0.005). The corresponding results suggest that  the 15-bp InDel mutation of PLAG1 is associated with the regulation of important  growth characteristics of both adult and lamb of goats, which may serve as efficient molecular markers for goat breeding.	0
34097819	Disentangling adaptation from drift in bottlenecked and reintroduced populations  of Alpine ibex.	Identifying local adaptation in bottlenecked species is essential for conservation management. Selection detection methods have an important role in species management plans, assessments of adaptive capacity, and looking for responses to climate change. Yet, the allele frequency changes exploited in selection detection methods are similar to those caused by the strong neutral genetic drift expected during a bottleneck. Consequently, it is often unclear what accuracy selection detection methods have across bottlenecked populations. In this study, simulations were used to explore if signals of selection could be  confidently distinguished from genetic drift across 23 bottlenecked and reintroduced populations of Alpine ibex (Capra ibex). The meticulously recorded demographic history of the Alpine ibex was used to generate comprehensive simulated SNP data. The simulated SNPs were then used to benchmark the confidence we could place in outliers identified in empirical Alpine ibex RADseq derived SNP data. Within the simulated data set, the false positive rates were high for all selection detection methods (FST outlier scans and Genetic-Environment Association analyses) but fell substantially when two or more methods were combined. True positive rates were consistently low and became negligible with increased stringency. Despite finding many outlier loci in the empirical Alpine ibex SNPs, none could be distinguished from genetic drift-driven false positives. Unfortunately, the low true positive rate also prevents the exclusion of recent local adaptation within the Alpine ibex. The baselines and stringent approach outlined here should be applied to other bottlenecked species to ensure the risk  of false positive, or negative, signals of selection are accounted for in conservation management plans.	0
35158687	Carcass Quality Profiles and Associated Genomic Regions of South African Goat Populations Investigated Using Goat SNP50K Genotypes.	Carcass quality includes a battery of essential economic meat traits that play a  significant role in influencing farmer breed preferences. A preliminary study was undertaken to investigate the carcass quality and the associated genomic regions  in a small nucleus of animals that are representative of South African goat genetic resources. Samples of the South African Boer (n = 14), Northern Cape Speckled (n = 14), Eastern Cape Xhosa Lob ear (n = 12), Nguni/Mbuzi (n = 13), and Village (n = 20) were genotyped using the Illumina goat SNP50K and were phenotyped for carcass quality traits. SA Boer goats had heavier warm and cold carcass weights (17.2 ± 2.3 kg and 16.3 ± 2.3 kg). Pella village goats raised under an intensive system had significantly (p < 0.05) heavier warm and cold carcass weights (9.9 ± 1.1 kg and 9.2 ± 1.2 kg) compared to the village goats that are raised extensively (9.1 ± 2.0 kg and 8.4 ± 1.9). A total of 40 SNPs located on chromosomes 6, 10, 12, 13, 19, and 21 were significantly associated with carcass traits at (-log10 [p < 0.05]). Candidate genes that were associated  with carcass characteristics (GADD45G, IGF2R, GAS1, VAV3, CAPN8, CAPN7, CAPN2, GHSR, COLQ, MRAS, and POU1F1) were also observed. Results from this study will inform larger future studies that will ultimately find use in breed improvement programs.	0
34650601	Genetic Variations and Differential DNA Methylation to Face Contrasted Climates in Small Ruminants: An Analysis on Traditionally-Managed Sheep and Goats.	The way in which living organisms mobilize a combination of long-term adaptive mechanisms and short-term phenotypic plasticity to face environmental variations  is still largely unknown. In the context of climate change, understanding the genetic and epigenetic bases for adaptation and plasticity is a major stake for preserving genomic resources and the resilience capacity of livestock populations. We characterized both epigenetic and genetic variations by contrasting 22 sheep and 21 goats from both sides of a climate gradient, focusing on free-ranging populations from Morocco. We produced for each individual Whole-Genome Sequence at 12X coverage and MeDIP-Seq data, to identify regions under selection and those differentially methylated. For both species, the analysis of genetic differences (FST) along the genome between animals from localities with high vs. low temperature annual variations detected candidate genes under selection in relation to environmental perception (5 genes), immunity (4 genes), reproduction (8 genes) and production (11 genes). Moreover, we found for each species one differentially methylated gene, namely AGPTA4 in goat and SLIT3 in sheep, which were both related, among other functions, to milk production and muscle development. In both sheep and goats, the comparison between genomic regions impacted by genetic and epigenetic variations suggests that climatic variations impacted similar biological pathways but different genes.	0
35108172	Association between the copy number variation of CCSER1 gene and growth traits in Chinese Capra hircus (goat) populations.	Recently, Coiled-coil serine-rich protein 1 (CCSER1) gene is reported to be related to economic traits in livestock, and become a hotspot. In our study, we detected CCSER1 gene CNV in 693 goats from six breeds (GZB, GZW, AN, BH, HG, TH)  by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and the association analysis between the types of CNV and growth traits. Then, CCSER1 gene expression pattern was discovered in seven tissues from NB goats. Our results showed that the CCSER1 gene copy numbers were distributed differently in the aforementioned six breeds.  The type of CCSER1 gene CNV was significantly associated with body weight and heart girth traits in GZW goat, in which individuals with deletion type were dominant in body weight trait (P < 0.05), while the normal type individuals were  more advantageous in heart girth trait (P < 0.01); and there was a significant association with heart girth in TH goat (P < 0.05), which normal type was the dominant one. The expression profile revealed that CCSER1 gene has the highest level in the lung, followed by the small intestine and heart. In conclusion, our  result is dedicated to an in-depth study of the novel CCSER1 gene CNV site and to provide essential information for Chinese goats molecular selective breeding in the future.	0
34767242	Intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin test in the diagnosis of caprine tuberculosis.	Tuberculosis remains one of the most important infectious diseases with well-known zoonotic nature that affect humans, wildlife, and domestic animals, including goats. Nonetheless, no intradermal tuberculin test has been standardized for caprine diagnosis of tuberculosis. The present study investigated the intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin test (ICCTT) in the  diagnosis of tuberculosis among 60 goats from farms with history of tuberculosis. The cutoff applied to goats was based on a study where goats had been experimentally infected with Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium avium. Clinical examination, bacteriological culture, and histopathological staining were assessed to the diagnosis. Isolates compatible with mycobacteria were subjected for molecular diagnosis based on gyrB-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and PCR restriction-enzyme analysis (PRA) of hsp65 gene by BstEII and HaeIII, namely PRA-hsp65 assay. From all goats, 60% (n = 36/60), 3.3% (n = 2/60), and 36.7% (n = 22/60) showed positive, inconclusive, and negative reactions, respectively. Out of 36 goats with ICCTT positive, 75% (n = 27/36) had isolation of mycobacteria and were detected M. bovis by gyrB-RFLP. Molecular diagnosis and histopathological findings compatible with tuberculosis showed 86.1% (n = 31/36) concordance with the ICCTT. When compared ICCTT with M. bovis isolation, gyrB-RFLP, and histopathology, the better arithmetic means of sensitivity and specificity were 2.5 mm for ICCTT compared with M. bovis isolation and gyrB-RFLP, and 4.55 mm when compared with histopathology. Both receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves presented statistical significance (P < 0.001). The identification of other mycobacteria, e.g., M. kansasii, M. flavescens, M. avium, M. florentinum, M. lentiflavum, M. simiae, and Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, not influenced positive results in ICCTT. The concordance between bacteriological, histopathological, and molecular identification with ICCTT findings indicate that the tuberculin test may be used as a valuable tool for diagnosis of caprine tuberculosis and reinforce the importance of association of methods to diagnostic of the disease from animal origin.	0
35366687	Proteomic analysis of coarse and fine skin tissues of Liaoning cashmere goat.	Proteomics is the study of all proteins expressed by a cell or even an organism.  However, knowledge of proteins that regulate the fineness of cashmere is limited. Liaoning cashmere goat (LCG) is a valuable genetic resource of China. The skin samples of Liaoning cashmere goats during the growing period were collected, performed tandem mass tag (TMT) method, and identified 117 differentially expressed proteins in CT_LCG (course type) and FT_LCG (fine type). To verify proteins differentially expressed in LCG, we performed PRM validation on three candidate proteins (ALB, SDC1, and ITGB4) in CT-LCG and FT-LCG. Furthermore, primary metabolic process and lysosome are most enriched in the GO and KEGG pathways, respectively. In addition, we also derived a protein-protein interaction (PPI) regulatory network from the perspective of bioinformatics. This study sought to elucidate the molecular mechanism of differential proteins regulating cashmere fineness of Liaoning cashmere goats by using TMT quantitative proteomics analysis. Differentially expressed proteins ALB and SDC1 may regulate  cashmere fineness; ITGB4 can become a promising protein for further study. They can be used as key proteins to lay a foundation for studying cashmere fineness of Liaoning cashmere goats.	0
35227969	Effects of maternal feed intake restriction on the blood parameters, fatty acid profile and lipogenetic genes expression of perirenal fat in offspring kids.	Maternal nutritional restriction impacted lipogenic gene expression in adipose tissue of offspring, but the association of this programming with DNA methylation is not yet clear. Therefore, this experiment aimed to investigate the effects of  maternal feed intake restriction on offsprings' blood indexes, lipid metabolism of perirenal adipose tissue (PAT) and DNA methylation of lipogenic genes. Blood and PAT were collected from the fetuses (at d 100 of gestation) and kids (at d 90 after birth). Maternal undernutrition (at d 45 to d 100) decreases heart and kidney weight of kid goats after birth. Maternal undernutrition decreased the content of leptin in the umbilical cord blood of fetuses. The expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) was decreased in fetal PAT of the restriction group,  but fatty acid synthetase (FASN) was increased. Protein abundance of UCP1 and FASN was down-regulated in the fetal PAT from the restriction group. Furthermore, only the methylation level of the CpG site (from -756 to -757 bp) in the promoter region of FASN gene was increased for the fetal PAT from the restriction group. These results revealed that maternal feed intake restriction influenced the leptin secretion, changed the expression of FASN and UCP1 gene of fetal PAT. This alteration was able to recover in the kids after removing intake restriction, but the growth performance and visceral organ mass were still impaired, suggesting abnormal fat metabolism may happen in the future.	0
35340540	Association between Serum Trace Elements Levels, Steroid Concentrations, and Reproductive Disorders in Ewes and Does.	This study aimed to investigate the association of different reproductive disorders with the status of serum trace elements and steroid hormones in ewes and goats. This study included 131 barren and 11 fertile (control) ewes and 94 barren and 9 fertile (control) goats. Animals were examined gynecologically for reproductive soundness. The animals were bled, and their serum was harvested and  assayed for manganese (Mn), selenium (Se), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), estrogen (E2), and progesterone (P4) levels. The results showed that genital affections were associated with significant changes in serum Se (P=0.001), Fe (P=0.008), and Zn (P=0.01) levels in ewes, as well as Mn (P=0.01) levels in goats. Ewes and goats with cystic ovaries had higher serum Se, Fe, and Zn levels (P=0.0001) than ewes with uterine affections, ovarian inactivity, and controls. Ovarian inactivity was linked to low Se levels in ewes and low Se and Zn levels in goats (P=0.05). Ewes  and goats with estrogen-dominant reproductive disorders had higher Se (P=0.01), Fe (P=0.03), and Zn (P=0.01) compared with the control group. Se (P=0.02) and Zn  (P=0.05) were lower in ewes and goats affected with P4-dominant genital disorders compared with the control group. It can be concluded that the reproductive disorders are associated with changes in the level of trace elements in blood of  ewes and goats. There is a reciprocal relationship between the levels of estrogen and progesterone with those of the trace elements in serum of ewes and goats.	0
34237919	Genetic parameters for somatic cell score, milk yield and type traits in Nigerian Dwarf goats.	OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to estimate multi-trait genetic parameters for somatic cell score (SCS), milk yield and type traits in Nigerian Dwarf (ND) goats from the United States. METHODS: Data from 1,041 ND goats in the United States with kiddings in 95 herds  were used to estimate multi-trait genetic parameters for SCS, milk (MILK), fat (FAT), and protein (PROT) yields, and 14 type traits. An 18-trait mixed linear animal model for lactation mean SCS (Log2), MILK, FAT, PROT, and 14 type traits was applied. A factor analytic approach (FA1) in ASReml software was used to obtain convergence. RESULTS: Averages for SCS were low (2.85±1.29 Log2), and were 314±110.6, 20.9±7.4, and 14±4.9 kg, respectively, for MILK, FAT, and PROT. Heritabilities for SCS, MILK, FAT, and PROT were 0.32, 0.16, 0.16, and 0.10, respectively. The highest heritabilities for type traits were for stature (0.72), teat diameter (0.49), and rump width (0.48), and the lowest estimates were for dairyness (0.003) and medial suspensory ligament (0.03). Genetic correlations of SCS with MILK, FAT, and PROT were positive but low (0.25, 0.18, and 0.23, respectively). Genetic and phenotypic correlations between MILK, FAT, and PROT were high and positive (≥0.66). Absolute values of genetic correlations involving SCS with type traits were generally low or no different from zero. Most of the phenotypic correlations involving SCS with type traits were low. No serious unfavorable genetic correlations between milk yield traits and SCS or between milk yield traits or SCS and type traits were found. CONCLUSION: Genetic variation exists in the ND breed for most studied traits. The development of selection programs based on these estimates may help accelerate favorable multitrait genetic changes in this breed.	0
34822225	Intersex goats show different gene expression levels in the hypothalamus and pituitary compared with non-intersex goats based on RNA-Seq.	The conditions for sex reversal in vertebrate species have been extensively studied, and the results highlighted numerous key factors involved in sex differentiation. However, the transcriptomes in hypothalamic and pituitary tissues from intersex goats have rarely been studied. The aim of this study was to screen candidate genes and signalling pathways related to sex reversal in Huai goats by analyzing gene expression in hypothalamic and pituitary tissues via transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analyses. In total, 612 and 139 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the intersex and non-intersex groups in the hypothalamus and pituitary, respectively. The DEGs in  the hypothalamus and pituitary were significantly enriched in 41 and 16 signalling pathways, respectively, including the calcium signalling pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction signalling pathway, and oestrogen signalling pathway, which might be related to intersex sex development disorders. A candidate gene from the tachykinin family (TACR1) was significantly enriched in the calcium signalling pathway. Thirty-one DEGs were shared between these two comparisons and were enriched in several acetyl-CoA-related processes and the oestrogen signalling pathway. The results of the real-time PCR analysis show that the transcriptome sequencing results were reliable. The transcriptome data indicate that the regulation of various physiological systems is involved in intersex goat development. Therefore, these results provide helpful data enhancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying intersex syndrome in goats.	0
34147084	Caprine PRNP polymorphisms N146S and Q222K are associated with proteolytic cleavage of PrPC.	Expression of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) is crucial for the development of prion diseases. Amino acid changes in PrPC or a reduced amount of PrPC may modulate disease resistance. The relative abundance of C1, a natural α-cleavage fragment of PrPC, was previously found to be associated with a resistant PRNP genotype in sheep. Goats are another small ruminant where classical scrapie susceptibility is under strong genetic control. In this study, we assessed PrPC in goats for the existence of similar associations between PrPC fragments and genotype. Brain tissue homogenates from scrapie-free goats with wild type PRNP or polymorphisms (I142M, H143R, N146S, or Q222K) were deglycosylated prior to immunoblot for assessment of the relative abundance of the C1 fragment of PrPC. The presence of K222 or S146 alleles demonstrated significantly different relative levels of C1 compared to that observed in wild type goats, which suggests that the genotype association with C1 is neither unique to sheep nor exclusive to the ovine Q171R dimorphism.	0
35299078	Molecular detection and characterization of tick-borne parasites in goats and ticks from Thailand.	Ticks and tick-borne pathogens (TTBPs) pose a serious economic threat to ruminant production worldwide. Despite this, investigations focused on goats remain limited compared to those for pathogens infecting cattle. We carried out PCR-based surveys and phylogenetic analyses to examine TTBPs from 6 provinces in  Thailand between January 2016 and June 2020. A total of 93 tick samples were collected as well as 969 blood samples from goats. All ticks were morphologically identified as Rhipicephalus microplus and confirmed for species based on 16S rRNA and cox1 gene sequences. The mitochondrial cox1 sequences in the present study were clustered into clades A and C. The overall infection rates of Anaplasma spp., piroplasmids, and co-infections of both parasites in goats were 13.5% (131/969), 2.7% (24/880), and 0.7% (7/969), respectively. We observed no statistically significant association between TTBP infections and age or sex. However, TTBP infections and the rainy season were linked (p < 0.05). Anaplasma bovis, Anaplasma marginale, and Anaplasma ovis were detected for the first time in goats in the country using primers targeting the chaperonin GroEL (groEL), major surface protein 2 (msp2), and major surface protein 4 (msp4) genes, while Anaplasma capra and Anaplasma phagocytophilum were not detected. Anaplasma bovis, A. marginale, and A. ovis isolates were clustered in a subclade that differed from the strains found in other countries. Among piroplasmids, only Theileria luwenshuni was detected in the current investigation. This work will add to the current understanding regarding the prevalence, genetic diversity, and genetic relationships of A. bovis, A. marginale, A. ovis, and T. luwenshuni among global  isolates and those in Thailand.	0
35064854	Training needs assessment of veterinary practitioners in Ethiopia.	Pastoral and agro-pastoral farming are extensively practised in Ethiopia, and the main livestock kept are cattle, goats, sheep, poultry, and camels. The livestock  sector is faced with complex challenges including limited availability of well-trained and skilled animal health professionals. The objective of this study was to identify and prioritise areas for training with the goal of providing evidence to guide strategies to improve the skills, delivery, and governance of veterinary services across Ethiopia. A cross-sectional survey was developed and administered electronically to veterinary professionals in Ethiopia using the Qualtrics platform. Data were collected on select parameters including demographics, diseases of economic significance, diagnosis, disease prevention, biosecurity, disease control, treatment, epidemiology, One Health, disease reporting, and the participants' opinions about training. The survey data was downloaded in Microsoft Excel and descriptive statistics performed. A total of 234 veterinary professionals completed the survey. Most participants were male (89.7%) and aged between 26 and 35 years (81.2%). Of the total respondents, 56.4% worked in government and 8.5% in private practice. Most participants perceived training on laboratory diagnostic testing, disease prevention, antimicrobial resistance, antibiotic sensitivity testing, basic epidemiology, and clinical procedures, as most beneficial. In addition, most respondents would like to receive training on diseases affecting cattle, poultry, and small ruminants. The  findings from this study provide baseline information on priority training areas  for veterinary professionals and could potentially contribute to national efforts to develop and implement a continuing professional development programme in the veterinary domain, in view of improving veterinary service delivery.	0
34749570	Genetic polymorphism of microsatellite loci in MHC class II exon 2 gene and its association with endoparasitic infestation, predominantly Haemonchus contortus in Salem black goat.	MHC gene is highly polymorphic and plays central molecule in immune system in recognition of pathogens and parasites. The present study examined the variability of MHC class II DRB exon 2 gene using microsatellite analysis, and its association with Haemonchus contortus infestation in Salem Black goat population. Animals were naturally exposed to mixed infestation of endoparasites, predominantly Haemonchus contortus. Pooled fecal coproculture and larval identification showed predominant presence of haemonchus (L3) larva. Fecal egg count (FEC) and packed cell volume (PCV) were used as indicator traits. All the three studied loci, OarCP73, DYA, and ODRB1.2, were polymorphic having three, four, and four alleles and four, eight, and nine genotypes, respectively. The loci showed low to moderate values of polymorphic information content. The mean fecal egg count estimates were 477.12 ± 34.14 eggs per gram of feces and the mean PCV values were within the normal range; however, they showed negative correlation with FEC values. All the three microsatellite loci and the effect of  genotypes on indicator traits were found to be statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05). The present study will be helpful in selection and breeding of goats  for Haemonchosis resistance.	0
34537924	Differences in burden of gastrointestinal nematode infestations in indigenous does foraging in grassland and forestland vegetation types.	Gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) infestations remain a major challenge to the health, productivity and reproductive performance of small ruminants. A longitudinal study was conducted to assess the effect of vegetation type, season  and parity on the burden of GIN in indigenous does that were foraging in grassland and forestland vegetation types. Body condition scores (BCS), packed cell volume (PCV), FAMACHA score and faecal egg counts (FEC) were determined in Xhosa lob-eared does (n = 165) during the cool-dry, hot-wet and post-rainy seasons in both vegetation types. Faecal samples were collected from the rectum and analysed using the modified McMaster technique. There was a significant association between vegetation type and season on the recorded BCS, body weight (BW), FEC, PCV and FAMACHA scores. Xhosa lob-eared does in the forestland had higher (P < 0.05) BCS as compared to those in grassland. Higher FEC (P < 0.05) were observed in Xhosa lob-eared does in the grassland vegetation compared to those in forestland. Body condition scores, FEC and FAMACHA scores were significantly higher in the hot-wet season than cool-dry and post-rainy seasons,  while PCV was significantly higher during the cool-dry compared to hot-wet season in forestland. Strongyles and Strongyloides eggs were higher in does grazing in the grassland than those in the forestland during the hot-wet season. Strategies  for the effective control of GIN in goats should consider that infestation levels differ with vegetation type, season and parity. Controlling of GIN in goats, therefore, requires an integrated control strategy that should consider the vegetation type that the goats are reared on.	0
34208578	A Candidate Gene Association Study for Economically Important Traits in Czech Dairy Goat Breeds.	Milk production is influenced by many factors, including genetic and environmental factors and their interactions. Animal health, especially udder health, is usually evaluated by the number of somatic cells. The present study described the effect of polymorphisms in the ACACA, BTN1A1, LPL, and SCD genes on the daily milk yield, fat, and protein percentages and somatic cell count. In this study, 590 White Shorthaired (WSH) and Brown Shorthaired (BSH) goats were included. SNP genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP and multiplex PCR followed by  SNaPshot minisequencing analysis. The linear mixed model with repeated measurement was used to identify the genetic associations between the studied genes/SNPs and chosen traits. All selected genes were polymorphic in the tested goat populations and showed significant associations with milk traits. Only BTN1A1 (SNP g.599 A > G) showed a significant association with the somatic cell score. After Bonferroni correction, a significant effect of LPL g.300G > A on daily milk yield and fat percentage, LPL g.185G > T on protein percentage, and LPL G50C, SCD EX3_15G > A, and SCD EX3_68A > G on fat percentage was found. The importance of environmental factors, such as the herd-year effect, month of milking, and lactation order on all milk performance indicators was confirmed.	0
34777526	Antibiotic sensitivity patterns in Staphylococcus spp. isolated from goat milk in association with molecular detection of antibiotic resistance genes.	BACKGROUND: Microbes become unresponsive to the drugs used to treat infections due to their ability to acquire antimicrobial resistance. AIMS: The present research aimed to study the patterns of phenotypic and genotypic antimicrobial resistance in Staphylococcus spp. isolated from goat milk. METHODS: A total of 200 milk samples were collected to isolate Staphylococcus spp. from mastitic and healthy goats from Punjab state, India. The isolates were  then identified biochemically and molecularly (polymerase chain reaction (PCR)).  An antibiotic sensitivity test was conducted using 15 different antibiotics. Molecular detection of antibiotic resistance genes was done using PCR. Chi-square test was done to study the association between genotypic and phenotypic resistance patterns among the isolates. RESULTS: A total of 47 Staphylococcus spp. were isolated of which 33 and 14 isolates were respectively coagulase positive and negative. The isolates phenotypically showed the highest resistance to Penicillin G (P) (91.4%). Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was found 56.25%. Amongst the  antibiotic resistance genes, tetK (87.23%) was the most prevalent isolated gene followed by blaZ (85.10%), mecA (48.93%), and tetM (14.89%). Statistical analysis revealed that the genotypic and phenotypic resistance patterns were significantly associated with penicillin and methicillin (MET) resistances. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus spp., especially MRSA, in goat milk is of concern and needs to be addressed in this area.	0
35196466	Changes in colostrum ingredients of Hu sheep, as well as the missense mutation genes associated with colostrum yield.	This study focused on the changes in the composition and immune evolution in milk from birth to 144 h postpartum and the genes associated with the colostrum yield  of Hu sheep. Twelve Hu sheep, which were bred carefully under animal health standards and have a litter size of two kids and similar gestation length (149 ± 1 days), were used. Lambs were transferred into their own cots to avoid interference. The compositional content (i.e., fat, protein, and lactose) and some other properties, including daily colostrum yield, DM, and SNF, were determined. In addition, immunity molecules (IgG, IgA, and IgM concentrations) received remarkable attention. The DM, SNF, fat, and protein contents were higher in the first days postpartum and then dropped quickly from the time of birth to 144 h postpartum. However, the lactose content displayed an increasing pattern and reached normal milk percentage at 48 h. The highest IgG (103.17 mg/mL), IgA (352.82 μg/mL), and IgM (2.79 mg/mL) colostrum concentrations were observed at partum, decreased quickly, and finally stabilized. The change law of concentration of IgA and IgM in colostrum are the same with IgG. Furthermore, the whole-genome resequencing was performed, and a missense variant locus in the SRC  gene and two missense locus variants in the HIF1A gene were significantly associated with the colostrum yield of sheep by using the whole-genome selection  signal detection analysis. In conclusions, colostrum contains abundant nutrients  especially immunoglobulin, and the HIF1A gene may be used as candidate genes for  colostrum yield, which has important information as a basic knowledge for the Hu  sheep breeding program.	0
34503498	Comprehensive transcriptome and methylome analysis delineates the biological basis of hair follicle development and wool-related traits in Merino sheep.	BACKGROUND: Characterization of the molecular mechanisms underlying hair follicle development is of paramount importance in the genetic improvement of wool-related traits in sheep and skin-related traits in humans. The Merino is the most important breed of fine-wooled sheep in the world. In this study, we systematically investigated the complexity of sheep hair follicle development by  integrating transcriptome and methylome datasets from Merino sheep skin. RESULTS: We analysed 72 sequence datasets, including DNA methylome and the whole  transcriptome of four gene types, i.e. protein-coding genes (PCGs), lncRNAs, circRNAs, and miRNAs, across four embryonic days (E65, E85, E105, and E135) and two postnatal days (P7 and P30) from the skin tissue of 18 Merino sheep. We revealed distinct expression profiles of these four gene types across six hair follicle developmental stages, and demonstrated their complex interactions with DNA methylation. PCGs with stage-specific expression or regulated by stage-specific lncRNAs, circRNAs, and miRNAs were significantly enriched in epithelial differentiation and hair follicle morphogenesis. Regulatory network and gene co-expression analyses identified key transcripts controlling hair follicle development. We further predicted transcriptional factors (e.g. KLF4, LEF1, HOXC13, RBPJ, VDR, RARA, and STAT3) with stage-specific involvement in hair follicle morphogenesis. Through integrating these stage-specific genomic features with results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of five wool-related traits in 7135 Merino sheep, we detected developmental stages and genes that were relevant with wool-related traits in sheep. For instance, genes that were specifically upregulated at E105 were significantly associated with most of wool-related traits. A phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) demonstrated that  candidate genes of wool-related traits (e.g. SPHK1, GHR, PPP1R27, CSRP2, EEF1A2,  and PTPN1) in sheep were also significantly associated with dermatological, metabolic, and immune traits in humans. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides novel insights into the molecular basis of hair follicle morphogenesis and will serve as a foundation to improve breeding for wool traits in sheep. It also indicates the importance of studying gene expression in the normal development of organs in understanding the genetic architecture of economically important traits in livestock. The datasets generated here are useful resources for functionally annotating the sheep genome, and for elucidating early skin development in mammals, including humans.	0
34680806	Prevalence, Patterns, Association with Biofilm Formation, Effects on Milk Quality and Risk Factors for Antibiotic Resistance of Staphylococci from Bulk-Tank Milk of Goat Herds.	The objectives of this work were to study the prevalence and the patterns of antibiotic resistance of staphylococcal isolates from bulk-tank milk of goat herds across Greece, to assess possible associations of the presence of antibiotic resistance with the quality of milk in these herds and to evaluate herd-related factors potentially associated with the presence of antibiotic resistance among these staphylococcal isolates. A cross-sectional study was performed on 119 goat herds in Greece. Bulk-tank milk samples were collected for  bacteriological examination; staphylococcal isolates were evaluated for resistance to 20 antibiotics. Oxacillin-resistant, resistant to at least one antibiotic, and multi-resistant staphylococcal isolates were recovered from 5.0%, 30.3%, and 16.0% of herds, respectively. Of 80 isolates, 7.5% were resistant to oxacillin, 50.0% were resistant to at least one antibiotic and 27.5% were multi-resistant. Resistance was seen more frequently among coagulase-negative staphylococci (59.3%) than among Staphylococcus aureus (23.8%). Resistance was more frequent against penicillin and ampicillin (41.3% of isolates) and fosfomycin (27.5%). No association was found with biofilm formation by staphylococci. For recovery of oxacillin-resistant isolates, the presence of working staff in the herds emerged as a significant factor; respective factors for the isolation of staphylococci resistant to at least one antibiotic were part-time farming and high (>10) number of systemic disinfections in the farm annually. The same three factors concurrently were also identified to be significant for the recovery of multi-resistant isolates.	0
35320991	TIMP1 may affect goat prolificacy by regulating biological function of granulosa  cells.	Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1) is associated with animal reproductive processes, such as follicular growth, ovulation, luteinization, and  embryo development in mammals. The purposes of this study were to explore the expression and localization of TIMP1 in the ovarian tissues and determine the effect of TIMP1 on the function of granulosa cells and the association of TIMP1 with lambing-related genes of the goats. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that TIMP1 protein was strongly expressed by granulosa cells. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results showed that TIMP1 overexpression promoted the secretion of estradiol of granulosa cells after 12, 24, and 48 h of transfection. Moreover, in vitro experiments indicated that TIMP1 had the ability to promote the cell proliferation and elevate the transcriptional levels of four genes associated with goat prolificacy, including BMPR-1B, BMP15, GDF9, and FSHB, in granulosa cells. In conclusion, TIMP1 could be an important molecule in regulating reproductive performance of the goats by affecting estrogen secretion  and cell proliferation, as well as the expression of lambing-related genes of granulosa cells in the goats.	0
35158679	Association of Hard Ticks (Ixodidae) Infestation with Milk Production and Udder Health of Extensively Reared Dairy Goats.	Extensively reared ruminants are seasonally exposed to ticks. Tick-related production losses and health issues have been well documented in cows and sheep but not in goats where relevant literature is scarce. The objective here was to investigate the association of hard tick infestation with milk production and udder health of dairy goats reared extensively. A cross-sectional study was carried out during May and June, in two dairy goat farms. The farms were located  in Central and Northern Greece and were representative of typical extensive production systems. A total of 304 goats (n = 152 from each farm) were randomly selected. Each goat was examined for presence of hard ticks. Daily milk yield and quality characteristics were recorded. Udder health status was determined by milk somatic cell count (SCC) and total viable count (TVC). Tick infestation prevalence was 28.6%; it was associated with a significant (p < 0.001) increase in SCC and TVC (84.0% and 78.6%, respectively). The latter meant that infested goats were 3.7 times more prone to udder health problems (p < 0.001). There were  not any significant effects (p > 0.05) on milk production. Overall, results suggest that control of tick infestation in extensively reared dairy goat herds is important for enhancing health and welfare status.	0
35056885	The Improved Milk Quality and Enhanced Anti-Inflammatory Effect in Acetylserotonin-O-methyltransferase (ASMT) Overexpressed Goats: An Association with the Elevated Endogenous Melatonin Production.	BACKGROUND: Transgenic animal production is an important means of livestock breeding and can be used to model pharmaceutical applications. METHODS: In this study, to explore the biological activity of endogenously produced melatonin, Acetylserotonin-O-methyltransferase (ASMT)-overexpressed melatonin-enriched dairy goats were successfully generated through the use of pBC1-ASMT expression vector construction and prokaryotic embryo microinjection. RESULTS: These transgenic goats have the same normal phenotype as the wild-type goats (WT). However, the melatonin levels in their blood and milk were significantly increased (p < 0.05). In addition, the quality of their milk was also improved, showing elevated protein content and a reduced somatic cell number compared to the WT goats. No significant changes were detected in the intestinal  microbiota patterns between groups. When the animals were challenged by the intravenous injection of E. coli, the ASMT-overexpressed goats had a lower level  of pro-inflammatory cytokines and higher anti-inflammatory cytokines compared to  the WT goats. Metabolic analysis uncovered a unique arachidonic acid metabolism pattern in transgenic goats. CONCLUSIONS: The increased melatonin production due to ASMT overexpression in the transgenic goats may have contributed to their improved milk quality and enhanced the anti-inflammatory ability compared to the WT goats.	0
34446111	Animal source food eating habits of outpatients with antimicrobial resistance in  Bukavu, D.R. Congo.	BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance is a public health concern in Democratic Republic Congo and worldwide. It is usually caused by antibiotic over prescription or dispensing practices. The consumption of animal source food (ASF) could be another source of antibiotic resistance but is rarely studied. The objective of the study was to evaluate the eating habits of ASF by outpatients with antimicrobial resistance through an analysis of (i) the association of their antimicrobial resistance with ASF consumption; (ii) the influence of the types of ASF on their antimicrobial resistance. METHODS: This is a retrospective analytical study conducted at three major Hospitals in Bukavu City (D. R. Congo). A total number of 210 patients, whose samples (mainly faeces and urine) had been subjected to bacterial examination, was included in this study. Morphological, biochemical and antibiotic susceptibility (using disc diffusion method) tests were performed on the samples. This served to isolate and identify resistant bacteria. Afterwards, patients responded to questions about the types and quantity of ASF eaten in the last week. We analysed data using descriptive statistics, logistic regression and non-parametric ranking tests. RESULTS: Escherichia coli (37.1%), Klebsiella pneumonae (14.7%), and Staphylococcus aureus (13.8%) were the most prevalent bacteria. E. coli (68.4%) and K. pneumonae (87.5%) were multidrug resistant (MDR), while S. aureus (7.7%) was minor. Low beef (O.R. 0.737, C.I. 0.542-1.002) and pork (O.R. 0.743, C.I. 0.560 - 0.985) consumption led to significantly (p < 0.05) lower risks of resistance to ciprofloxacin. Patients eating three different ASF per week had the highest resistance score (20.67) and high consumption rates of goat meat, pork and milk (41.5%). CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest a contribution of human nutrition  to antimicrobial resistance frequency. Our results show the existence of a high prevalence of multi-drug resistant bacteria in patients for which eating beef, pork and drinking milk are major risk factors. Therefore, a stricter control of antibiotic usage in livestock production and of their presence in ASF is recommended.	0
34431749	A deletion mutation within the goat AKAP13 gene is significantly associated with  litter size.	A-kinase anchoring protein 13 (AKAP13) is one of the AKAP protein family members, which is correlated with estrogen receptors (ERs) and progesterone receptor (PR)  activity. Consequently, the AKAP13 gene is considered to be one of the candidate  genes for regulating female fertility. Hence, the objectives of this study were to discover the potential insertion/deletion (indel) variants within the AKAP13 gene and evaluate their associations with litter size of Shaanbei white cashmere  goats (SBWC) to screen candidate genes for the molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS). Ultimately, we found the 16-bp deletion of AKAP13 gene which displayed three genotypes (II, ID and DD). However, it was not confirmed to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in the tested population. Statistical analysis demonstrated that this 16-bp indel locus was significantly associated with litter size in goats (p < 0.05), in which the ID genotype was a key genotype for increasing litter size in goats. Besides, independent χ2 tests between different  genotypes and litter size showed that high-prolific groups had higher frequency of the 'D' allele (p < 0.05). Briefly, AKAP13 gene is a candidate gene for improving fertility, and its 16-bp indel locus can be used as a valid DNA molecular marker for the MAS in goat breeding.	0
34909451	CD45 Immunohistochemistry in Mouse Kidney.	CD45 is a pan-leukocyte marker, and CD45 stain is widely used to determine the extent of inflammatory cell infiltration and its association with tissue injury.  In this manuscript, we share a reliable immunohistochemistry (IHC) protocol for CD45 staining in sections of paraffin-embedded mouse kidney. A rat anti-CD45 antibody was used as primary antibody, and a mouse adsorbed biotin-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG was selected as secondary antibody. A horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked avidin/biotin detection system was used to amplify the signal, which was detected with 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine (DAB). With this protocol, we show that the CD45 antibody recognizes cells of hematolymphoid lineage in bone marrow, as well as monocyte/macrophages in liver and lung tissue. The utility of this protocol in pathology research was indicated by dramatically increased CD45-positive (CD45+) cells in the kidneys of a mouse model of diabetes. Double staining for CD45 and injury marker KIM-1 showed accumulated CD45+ cells around injured tubular cells. CD45 and F4/80 macrophage staining on adjacent tissue sections revealed overlap of CD45+ cells with other inflammatory cells.	0
34557989	Evaluation of resistance to gastrointestinal helminth nematodes in two naturally  infected indigenous Nigerian goat breeds.	Tropical goat breeds often have at least modest resistance to gastrointestinal nematode parasites (GIN), but enhancement of GIN resistance is important for breed improvement. This study compared changes in fecal egg count (FEC), packed cell volume, and body weight in Red Sokoto (RS) and Sahelian (SH) male and female weaner kids and adult goats. The RS is found throughout Nigeria, but the SH is found only in the arid Sahel. Goats were evaluated fortnightly for 20 times (MT)  under normal grazing conditions and natural GIN infection over 9.5 months, beginning in the dry season (November) and ending at the end of the subsequent wet season (August). Animals were dewormed at the start of the study and during the rainy season (MT 18). Breed differences in FEC and PCV were not observed in weaners. Weaner females had lower FEC than males but were rapidly re-infected after deworming, perhaps in association with attainment of puberty. Adult SH goats of both sexes had lower FEC than RS goats in MT 8 through 17, suggesting a  stronger acquired immune response. The FEC in lactating females of both breeds increased rapidly after deworming, to ≥ 3000 eggs per gram of feces at MT 19 and  20. The optimal time to evaluate GIN resistance in weaners was during the early rainy season, but the decision to focus on the initial high FEC near MT 15 or wait until mobilization of the acquired immune response near MT 17 requires further consideration.	0
35268118	Genome-Wide Association Study of Body Conformation Traits by Whole Genome Sequencing in Dazu Black Goats.	Identifying associations between genetic markers and economic traits has practical benefits for the meat goat industry. To better understand the genomic regions and biological pathways contributing to body conformation traits of meat  goats, a genome-wide association study was performed using Dazu black goats (DBGs), a Chinese indigenous goat breed. In particular, 150 DBGs were genotyped by whole-genome sequencing, and six body conformation traits, including body height (BH), body length (BL), cannon circumference (CC), chest depth (CD), chest width (CW), and heart girth (HG), were examined. In total, 53 potential SNPs were associated with these body conformation traits. A bioinformatics analysis was performed to evaluate the genes located close to the significant SNPs. Finally, 42 candidate genes (e.g., PSTPIP2, C7orf57, CCL19, FGF9, SGCG, FIGN, and SIPA1L)  were identified as components of the genetic architecture underlying body conformation traits. Our results provide useful biological information for the improvement of growth performance and have practical applications for genomic selection in goats.	0
34358232	Integrated human-animal sero-surveillance of Brucellosis in the pastoral Afar and Somali regions of Ethiopia.	BACKGROUND: Brucellosis is widespread in Ethiopia with variable reported prevalence depending on the geographical area, husbandry practices and animal species. However, there is limited information on the disease prevalence amongst  pastoral communities, whose life is intricately linked with their livestock. METHODOLOGY: We conducted an integrated human-animal brucellosis sero-surveillance study in two adjacent pastoral regions, Afar and Somali region  (SRS). This cross-sectional study included 13 woredas (districts) and 650 households. Blood samples were collected from people and livestock species (cattle, camel, goats and sheep). Sera were analyzed with C-ELISA for camels and  shoats (sheep and goats), with I-ELISA for cattle and IgG ELISA for humans. Descriptive and inferential statistics analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 5469 sera were tested by ELISA. Prevalence of livestock was 9.0% in Afar and 8.6% in SRS (ranging from 0.6 to 20.2% at woreda level). In humans, prevalence was 48.3% in Afar and 34.9% in SRS (ranging from 0.0 to 74.5%  at woreda level). 68.4% of all households in Afar and 57.5% of households in SRS  had at least one animal reactor. Overall, 4.1% of animals had a history of abortion. The proportion of animals with abortion history was higher in seropositive animals than in seronegative animals. Risk factor analysis showed that female animals were significantly at higher risk of being reactors (p = 0.013). Among the species, cattle had the least risk of being reactors (p = 0.014). In humans, there was a clear regional association of disease prevalence (p = 0.002). The older the people, the highest the odds of being seropositive. CONCLUSION: Brucellosis is widespread in humans and animals in pastoral communities of Afar and SRS with the existence of geographical hotspots. No clear association was seen between human and particular livestock species prevalence, hence there was no indication as whether B. abortus or B. melitensis are circulating in these areas, which warrants further molecular research prior to embarking on a national control programs. Such programs will need to be tailored  to the pastoral context.	0
34929412	Risk assessment and seroprevalence of bovine herpesvirus type 1 infection in dairy herds in the inner Aegean Region of Turkey.	This cross-sectional study was performed to investigate the seroprevalence and associated risk factors of bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1) infection in dairy  cattle herds in Afyonkarahisar province in the Aegean Region of Turkey. Blood samples were collected from 602 cattle from 56 unvaccinated dairy herds between May 2018 and June 2019. Animal and herd-level epidemiological information was collected with a questionnaire during blood collection. Specific antibodies against BoHV-1 and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) were detected by using a virus neutralization test and a commercial indirect ELISA kit, respectively. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine any association between categorical variables and BoHV-1 seropositivity. The animal-level and herd-level seroprevalences of BoHV-1 infection were determined to be 39.53% (95% confidence interval, CI: 35.71-43.50) and 73.21% (95% CI: 60.41-83.04), respectively. Within-herd prevalence was more than 50% in 34.14% of infected herds. Cattle age (odds ratio, OR= 2.34, 95% CI: 1.58-3.44), BVDV infection (OR= 7.74, 95% CI: 5.08-11.76), and the presence of goats in the herd (OR= 2.84, 95% CI: 1.91-4.19) were identified as risk factors for BoHV-1 seropositivity by the multivariable logistic regression model. This is the first  study conducted in Turkey using two-layer sampling and logistic regression analyses to determine the herd-level and animal-level seroprevalence and associated risk factors of BoHV-1 infection.	0
34641885	Identification of Mycoplasma species and related organisms from ruminants in England and Wales during 2005-2019.	BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma species have been associated with economically important diseases affecting ruminants worldwide and include contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) and contagious  agalactia, listed by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). The Mycoplasma Team at the Animal and Plant Health Agency provides an identification  service for Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma species of veterinary importance to the United Kingdom (UK), supporting the detection of new and emerging pathogens, as well as contributing to the surveillance of endemic, and the OIE listed diseases  exotic to the UK. Mycoplasma and other Mollicutes species were identified from diagnostic samples from farmed ruminants in England and Wales using a combination of culture and 16S rRNA gene-based PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, submitted between 2005 and 2019. RESULTS: A total of 5578 mollicutes identifications, which include mycoplasmas and the related acholeoplasmas and ureaplasmas, were made from farmed ruminant animals during the study period. Throughout the study period, the pathogen Mycoplasma bovis was consistently the most frequently identified species, accounting for 1411 (32%) of 4447 molecular identifications in cattle, primarily  detected in the lungs of pneumonic calves, followed by joints and milk of cattle  showing signs of arthritis and mastitis, respectively. M. bovirhinis, M. alkalescens, M. dispar, M. arginini and Ureaplasma diversum, were also common. Mixed species, principally M. bovis with M. alkalescens, M. arginini or M. bovirhinis were also prevalent, particularly from respiratory samples. The non-cultivable blood-borne haemoplasmas Candidatus 'Mycoplasma haemobos' and Mycoplasma wenyonii were identified from cattle, with the latter species most often associated with milk-drop. M. ovipneumoniae was the predominant species identified from sheep and goats experiencing respiratory disease, while M. conjunctivae preponderated in ocular samples. The UK remains free of the ruminant mycoplasmas listed by OIE. CONCLUSIONS: The continued high prevalence of M. bovis identifications confirms its ongoing dominance and importance as a significant pathogen of cattle in England and Wales, particularly in association with respiratory disease. M. ovipneumoniae has seen a general increase in prevalence in recent years, notably  in coughing lambs and should therefore be considered as a primary differential diagnosis of respiratory disease in small ruminants.	0
34475723	Investigation of some trace elements and hematological and biochemical parameters in the blood of emaciated Omani goats.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: The analysis of hematological and biochemical parameters is widely used in assessing animal health status. Limited information is available on trace element levels and their association with hematological and biochemical  parameters in Omani goats suffering from emaciation. Therefore, the current study aimed to determine the levels of some trace elements in emaciated Omani goats and their relationship with hematological and biochemical parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Goats suffering from emaciation and muscular dystrophy (n=18) were compared with healthy goats (n=12). Venous blood samples for the hematological, biochemical, and trace element analysis were collected from the jugular vein. RESULTS: Emaciated goats showed significantly lower white blood cell, lymphocyte, and red blood cell counts than the healthy goats. In contrast, the percentages of monocytes and eosinophils were higher in emaciated goats than in healthy ones. In addition, emaciated goats showed higher levels of biochemical parameters alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and total bilirubin but lower levels of albumin than the healthy goats. The results of trace element analysis revealed lower concentrations of zinc, iron, and selenium in serum from emaciated goats than in serum from healthy goats. CONCLUSION: This study identified significant differences in the serum levels of  some trace elements and hematological and biochemical parameters between healthy  and emaciated Omani goats. The identified differences represent valuable diagnostic biomarkers for the evaluation of the health status of Omani goats.	0
34584939	Population validation of reproductive gene mutation loci and association with the litter size in Nubian goat.	Litter size is an important component trait of doe reproduction. By improving it, production efficiency and economic benefits can be significantly provided. Genetic marker-assisted selection (MAS) based on proven molecular indicators could enhance the efficacy of goat selection, as well as litter size trait. Many  molecular markers have been identified that they can be used to improve litter size in different goat breeds. However, the presence and value of these markers vary among goat breeds. In the present study, we used the reported loci on other  breeds of goat as candidate loci to detect whether these loci appear in this Nubian goat population; then we proceed to genotype and detect surrounding loci (50 bp) by multiplex PCR and sequencing technology. As a result, 69 mutations (59 SNPs and 10 indels) were screened out from 23 candidate genes in Nubian goat population, 12 loci were significantly associated with the litter size of first-parity individuals; 5 loci were significantly associated with the litter size of second-parity individuals; 3 loci were significantly associated with the  litter size of third-parity individuals. In addition, five loci were significantly associated with the average litter size. The additive effect value  of KITLG: g.18047318 G > A in first parity, KITLG: g.18152042G > A in third parity, KISS-1: g.1341674 C > G in first parity, and GHR: g.32134187G > A in second parity exceed more than 0.40, and the preponderant alleles are G, C, A and G, respectively. Further, linkage disequilibrium analysis of 21 mutation loci shows that 3 haplotype blocks are formed, and the litter size of combination type AACC in KISS-1 gene and AAGG in KITLG gene are significantly lower than that of other combinations genotype in first parity ( P < 0.05 ). These findings can provide effective candidate DNA markers for selecting superior individuals in Nubian goat breeding.	0
34733908	Detection of mRNA Expression and Copy Number Variations Within the Goat Fec B Gene Associated With Litter Size.	The Booroola fecundity (Fec B ) gene, as the first major fecundity gene identified in Booroola sheep, has attracted careful attention. So far, previous research have uncovered the FecB mutation (Q249R) as the main mutation by virtue  of which sheep exhibits multiple lambing phenomena. This mutation is now being intensively studied and widely used. However, such effect of the FecB mutation has not been applied to goats, and similar types of the Fec B gene in goats still need to be studied. Thus, the current study attempted to verify potential mutations in the goat Fec B gene as well as investigate their functions related to fecundity. First, Fec B expression was investigated in six different goat tissues, and we found that Fec B expression was highest in the mammary gland, followed by the ovary. Next, the influence of the Fec B gene was analyzed from a  new perspective, where five potential copy number variations (CNVs) (CNV1-5) within the Fec B gene were identified for the first time, and then their effects  on litter size were measured. Our results point out that CNV3 (P = 3.44E-4) and CNV5 (P = 0.034) could significantly influence the litter size of goats. Identically, the combination genotype of CNV3 and CNV5 which consisted of their dominant genotypes was also significantly associated with goat litter size (P = 7.80E-5). Hence, CNV3 and CNV5 could serve as potential DNA molecular markers applied to DNA editing and DNA microarray. Additionally, the abovementioned study has laid a theoretical foundation for the detection of potential fertility-related quantitative trait loci within the goat Fec B gene.	0
35073837	Runs of homozygosity in Swiss goats reveal genetic changes associated with domestication and modern selection.	BACKGROUND: The domestication of goat (Capra hircus) started 11,000 years ago in  the fertile crescent. Breed formation in the nineteenth century, establishment of herd books, and selection for specific traits resulted in 10 modern goat breeds in Switzerland. We analyzed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from 217 modern goats and nine wild Bezoar goats (Capra aegagrus). After quality control, 27,728,288 biallelic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were used for the identification of runs of homozygosity (ROH) and the detection of ROH islands. RESULTS: Across the 226 caprine genomes from 11 populations, we detected 344 ROH  islands that harbor 1220 annotated genes. We compared the ROH islands between the modern breeds and the Bezoar goats. As a proof of principle, we confirmed a signature of selection, which contains the ASIP gene that controls several breed-specific coat color patterns. In two other ROH islands, we identified two missense variants, STC1:p.Lys139Arg and TSHR:p.Ala239Thr, which might represent causative functional variants for domestication signatures. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that the information from ROH islands using WGS data is suitable for the analysis of signatures of selection and allowed the detection of protein coding variants that may have conferred beneficial phenotypes during goat domestication. We hypothesize that the TSHR:p.Ala239Thr variant may have played a role in changing the seasonality of reproduction in modern domesticated  goats. The exact functional significance of the STC1:p.Lys139Arg variant remains  unclear and requires further investigation. Nonetheless, STC1 might represent a new domestication gene affecting relevant traits such as body size and/or milk yield in goats.	0
35087996	Candidate genes for productivity identified by genome-wide association study with indicators of class in the Russian meat merino sheep breed.	Genome-wide association studies allow identification of loci and polymorphisms associated with the formation of relevant phenotypes. When conducting a full genome analysis of sheep, particularly promising is the study of individuals with outstanding productivity indicators - exhibition animals, representatives of the  super-elite class. The aim of this study was to identify new candidate genes for  economically valuable traits based on the search for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with belonging to different evaluation classes in rams of the Russian meat merino breed. Animal genotyping was performed using Ovine Infinium HD BeadChip 600K DNA, association search was performed using PLINK v. 1.07 software. Highly reliable associations were found between animals belonging to different evaluation classes and the frequency of occurrence of individual SNPs on chromosomes 2, 6, 10, 13, and 20. Most of the substitutions with high association reliability are concentrated on chromosome 10 in the region 10: 30859297-31873769. To search for candidate genes, 15 polymorphisms with the highest association reliability were selected (-log10(р) > 9). Determining the location of the analyzed SNPs relative to the latest annotation Oar_rambouillet_v1.0 allowed to identify 11 candidate genes presumably associated with the formation of a complex of phenotypic traits of animals in the exhibition group: RXFP2, ALOX5AP, MEDAG, OPN5, PRDM5, PTPRT, TRNAS-GGA, EEF1A1, FRY, ZBTB21-like, and B3GLCT-like. The listed genes encode proteins involved in the control of the cell cycle and DNA replication, regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, the development of the inflammatory process and the work of circadian rhythms. Thus, the candidate genes under consideration can influence the formation of exterior features and productive qualities of sheep. However, further research is needed to confirm the influence of genes and determine the exact mechanisms for implementing this influence on the phenotype.	0
34765663	Epidemiological, Morphological, and Morphometric Study on Haemonchus spp. Recovered From Goats in Egypt.	Goats can be infected by multiple groups of external and internal parasites. Haemonchus spp. are among abomasal parasites that can result in higher mortality  and several considerable economic losses in goats. Early detection of parasites and better understanding of the major risk factors associated with infection are  among the main strategies for controlling the infection. Considering this, information on hemonchosis in goats from Egypt, and the contribution of goats in  the maintenance of the epidemiological foci of the disease is limited. This study investigated the prevalence of Haemonchus species among 240 abomasum samples collected during postmortem examination of goat carcasses from Assiut Governorate, Egypt. Moreover, the association of the major risk factors to describe the epidemiological pattern of the disease was explored. This study demonstrated that 16.66% of abomasa samples harbored Haemonchus species. Additionally, age, sex, and sampling season were the most significant risk factors associated with infection. Following the variable factors under study, goats aged 1 year or older were at higher risk, with an infection rate of 22.14%  (31 of 140), than those younger than 1 year (9%) [p = 0.008; odds ratio (OR) = 2.87; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.30-6.35]. The infection rate was 25% (19 of 76) in males and 12.8% (21 of 164) in females [p = 0.024; odds ratio (OR) = 2.26; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.13-4.53]. Moreover, the exposure to infection was higher in summer (22.22%) than in winter (8.33%) (p = 0.007; odds ratio (OR) = 0.318; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.139-0.725). More importantly, three species of the parasite-Haemonchus contortus, Haemonchus placei, and Haemonchus longistipes-were identified for the first time, and the confirmation of the identification and morphological characterization of the worms was performed using light microscopy and SEM. Collectively, this study reveals interesting epidemiological, morphological, and morphometric findings associated with the occurrence of hemonchosis among goats in Egypt. This study suggests further research for exploring the major circulating species of the parasite in Egypt, which is mandatory for controlling the disease.	0
34893919	Seroprevalence and risk factors for Leptospira spp. in small ruminants of semi-arid zone in northeastern Colombia.	Leptospirosis in small ruminants is an economically important disease that causes important losses by pathologies of the reproductive tract. The present study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with Leptospira  spp. in small ruminants under traditional husbandry systems. A cross-sectional epidemiological study was carried out in a sample of 1039 animals which included  793 sheep and 245 goats from 49 farms of 10 municipalities of northeastern areas  of Colombia. The MAT test using a panel of 13 laboratory serovars was performed to diagnose the Leptospira spp. antibodies in the serum samples of animals. A structured questionnaire was filled in each farm to obtain information on putative risk factors, and its association with Leptospira spp. infection was detected by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. The general seroprevalence showed a rate of 13.9%, the 79.6% of farms showed at least one positive animal, the 14.2% and 0.4% of positive animals showed titers ≥ 1:100 and 1:200, respectively. The seroprevalence in sheep and goats showed a rate of 13.1% and 16.2%, respectively. The most common serovars in positive animals were Autumnalis (3.6%), Tarassovi (3.4%), Bratislava (2.9%), Mini (2.9%), Bataviae (1.4%), Canicola (0.3%), and Grippotyphosa (0.3%). The univariate and multivariate analysis showed as risk factors the absence of housing system (OR = 3.412 CI: 1.347-8.152), the absence of quarantine measures to new animals (OR = 1.371 CI: 0.943-1.978), and the protective factor identified was the use of Toggenburg breed (OR = 0.571 CI: 0.249-1.074). This exploratory study showed the  Leptospira spp. positive small ruminants located in the northeastern areas of Colombia with titer associated with chronic and subclinical infection.	0
35454279	Serological Survey of Small Ruminant Lentivirus Infections in Free-Ranging Mouflon and Chamois in Slovenia.	Small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs) belong to the genus Lentivirus in the Retroviridae family, which are responsible for the diseases maedi-visna and caprine arthritis-encephalitis in sheep and goats worldwide and are also widespread in Slovenian sheep and goats. SRLVs cause lifelong infections with chronic inflammatory lesions in various organ systems. Cross-species transmission of SRLV strains in sheep and goats is well documented, but there are few data on  the ability of these viruses to infect wild ruminants. The objective of this study was to investigate whether SRLVs circulate among wild small ruminants in Slovenia. During the 2017-2018 hunting season, a total of 38 blood samples were collected from free-ranging chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) and European mouflon (Ovis ammon musimon). The serum samples were tested for antibodies against SRLV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The serological tests revealed that of all tested mouflons, 1 animal (11.1%) was seropositive, while all samples from chamois were negative. Based on the results of this study and considering the results of previous studies in which SRLV infections were detected in mouflons with low seroprevalence, it is very likely that the detected seropositive animal  was an incidental spillover host for SRLV. Although no seropositive samples were  found in chamois, we cannot speculate on whether chamois may not be a host for SRLV infection because of the small sample size and the disadvantages of the ELISA assay used when applied to samples from chamois.	0
34273992	Cross-sectional study and genotyping of rotavirus-A infections in ruminants in Kuwait.	BACKGROUND: Group A rotaviruses (RVA) are zoonotic pathogens responsible for acute enteritis in human and neonatal ruminants. This research aimed to determine the prevalence of RVA in ruminants (cattle, sheep, and goats) and investigate the circulating RVA genotypes in these animals in Kuwait. We conducted a cross-sectional study to detect RVA in ruminants, using an immunochromatography test (IC), direct sandwich ELISA test, and real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) assay using fecal samples. RESULTS: A total of 400 cattle, 334 sheep, and 222 goats were examined. The prevalence of RVA was 5.3, 1.2, and 2.3%, respectively, using IC. The ELISA test  detected RVA from 4.3% of cattle, 0.9% of sheep, and 1.8% of goats. There was a significant association between the occurrence of diarrhea and the presence of RVA in bovine fecal samples (p-value = 0.0022), while no statistical association  between diarrhea and the presence of RVA in fecal samples of sheep and goats was  observed (p-value = 0.7250; p-value = 0.4499, respectively). Twenty-three of the  IC-positive samples (17 from cattle, two from sheep, and four from goats) were tested using a RT-qPCR RVA detection assay targeting the NSP3 gene. The results showed that 21 of 23 IC-positive samples tested positive by RT-qPCR. Detection of RVA genotypes revealed that G10P[11] was the predominant strain in cattle (58.8%), followed by G8P[1] (11.7%). One sheep sample was genotyped as G8P[1]. In addition, G6P[1] and G6P[14] were detected in goat samples. CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that the IC was more sensitive in detecting RVA antigen in fecal samples than the ELISA test. A higher occurrence of RVA infection was observed in cattle than in sheep and goats. This study suggests that RVA might be a risk factor of diarrhea in bovine calves less than 2 weeks old. This research also demonstrates the circulation of RVA in sheep and goat populations in Kuwait. Finally, the G10P[11] RVA genotype was the most prevalent genotype identified from cattle samples.	0
34841617	Signatures of selection are present in the genome of two close autochthonous cattle breeds raised in the North of Italy and mainly distinguished for their coat colours.	Autochthonous cattle breeds are genetic resources that, in many cases, have been  fixed for inheritable exterior phenotypes useful to understand the genetic mechanisms affecting these breed-specific traits. Reggiana and Modenese are two closely related autochthonous cattle breeds mainly raised in the production area  of the well-known Protected Designation of Origin Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, in  the North of Italy. These breeds can be mainly distinguished for their standard coat colour: solid red in Reggiana and solid white with pale shades of grey in Modenese. In this study we genotyped with the GeneSeek GGP Bovine 150k single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip almost half of the extant cattle populations of Reggiana (n = 1109 and Modenese (n = 326) and used genome-wide information in  comparative FST analyses to detect signatures of selection that diverge between these two autochthonous breeds. The two breeds could be clearly distinguished using multidimensional scaling plots and admixture analysis. Considering the top  0.0005% FST values, a total of 64 markers were detected in the single-marker analysis. The top FST value was detected for the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene mutation, which determines the red coat colour of the Reggiana breed. Another coat colour gene, agouti signalling protein (ASIP), emerged amongst this  list of top SNPs. These results were also confirmed with the window-based analyses, which included 0.5-Mb or 1-Mb genome regions. As variability affecting  ASIP has been associated with white coat colour in sheep and goats, these results highlighted this gene as a strong candidate affecting coat colour in Modenese breed. This study demonstrates how population genomic approaches designed to take advantage from the diversity between local genetic resources could provide interesting hints to explain exterior traits not yet completely investigated in cattle.	0
35096002	Selection of Cashmere Fineness Functional Genes by Translatomics.	Cashmere fineness is an important index to evaluate cashmere quality. Liaoning Cashmere Goat (LCG) has a large cashmere production and long cashmere fiber, but  its fineness is not ideal. Therefore, it is important to find genes involved in cashmere fineness that can be used in future endeavors aiming to improve this phenotype. With the continuous advancement of research, the regulation of cashmere fineness has made new developments through high-throughput sequencing and genome-wide association analysis. It has been found that translatomics can identify genes associated with phenotypic traits. Through translatomic analysis,  the skin tissue of LCG sample groups differing in cashmere fineness was sequenced by Ribo-seq. With these data, we identified 529 differentially expressed genes between the sample groups among the 27197 expressed genes. From these, 343 genes  were upregulated in the fine LCG group in relation to the coarse LCG group, and 186 were downregulated in the same relationship. Through GO enrichment analysis and KEGG enrichment analysis of differential genes, the biological functions and  pathways of differential genes can be found. In the GO enrichment analysis, 491 genes were significantly enriched, and the functional region was mainly in the extracellular region. In the KEGG enrichment analysis, the enrichment of the human papillomavirus infection pathway was seen the most. We found that the COL6A5 gene may affect cashmere fineness.	0
35454235	Candidate Genes and Their Expressions Involved in the Regulation of Milk and Meat Production and Quality in Goats (Capra hircus).	Despite their pivotal position as relevant sources for high-quality proteins in particularly hard environmental contexts, the domestic goat has not benefited from the advances made in genomics compared to other livestock species. Genetic analysis based on the study of candidate genes is considered an appropriate approach to elucidate the physiological mechanisms involved in the regulation of  the expression of functional traits. This is especially relevant when such functional traits are linked to economic interest. The knowledge of candidate genes, their location on the goat genetic map and the specific phenotypic outcomes that may arise due to the regulation of their expression act as a catalyzer for the efficiency and accuracy of goat-breeding policies, which in turn translates into a greater competitiveness and sustainable profit for goats worldwide. To this aim, this review presents a chronological comprehensive analysis of caprine genetics and genomics through the evaluation of the available literature regarding the main candidate genes involved in meat and milk production and quality in the domestic goat. Additionally, this review aims to serve as a guide for future research, given that the assessment, determination and characterization of the genes associated with desirable phenotypes may provide information that may, in turn, enhance the implementation of goat-breeding programs in future and ensure their sustainability.	0
35327114	Women's Empowerment and Livestock Vaccination: Evidence from Peste des Petits Ruminants Vaccination Interventions in Northern Ghana.	Healthy livestock provide meaningful opportunities to enhance women's empowerment (WE) in low- and middle-income countries. Animal vaccines are important to keep livestock healthy and productive. However, gender-based restrictions limit women's access to animal health services, thereby affecting the potential of livestock to enhance their empowerment. While growing empirical evidence reveals  that women-controlled livestock (e.g., small ruminants) have important implications for WE and support better household nutrition outcomes, little empirical evidence exists from rigorous analyses of the relationship between WE and animal vaccines for women-controlled livestock species. Our analysis explores the relationship between WE and involvement with PPR vaccination in Ghana. Data collected using the Women's Empowerment in Livestock Index (WELI) tool from 465 women and 92 men farmers (who keep goats) from northern Ghana, and analyzed using PLS-SEM, revealed a significant direct positive association between knowledge about animal health and PPR vaccines and a significant indirect positive association between access to PPR vaccines and empowerment. The empowerment of women goat farmers, as revealed by our model's results for the relationship between empowerment and vaccine facets, was significantly represented by asset ownership and input into decisions concerning livestock. These study results reveal important considerations in designing effective and equitable livestock vaccine systems.	0
34844207	Ruminant-Related Risk Factors are Associated with Shiga Toxin-Producing Escherichia coli Infection in Children in Southern Ghana.	Livestock can provide benefits to low-income households, yet may expose children  to zoonotic enteropathogens that cause illness and negative long-term health outcomes. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether livestock-related risk factors, including animal ownership, exposure to animal feces, and consumption of animal-source foods, were associated with bacterial zoonotic enteropathogen infections in children 6-59 months old in Greater Accra,  Ghana. Stool samples from 259 children and 156 household chickens were analyzed for atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (aEPEC), Campylobacter jejuni/coli (C. jejuni/coli), Salmonella, and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). aEPEC, C. jejuni/coli, STEC, and Salmonella were detected in 45.6%, 11.6%, 4.3%, and 0.8% of children's stool  samples, respectively. In adjusted logistic regression models, household ownership of goats or sheep was associated with STEC detection in children (odds  ratio [95% confidence interval]: 4.30 [1.32, 14.08]), as were positive detection  of STEC in chicken feces (7.85 [2.54, 24.30]) and frequent consumption of fresh cow's milk (3.03 [1.75, 5.24]). No livestock-related risk factors were associated with aEPEC or C. jejuni/coli infection in children. Our findings suggest that ruminant ownership in southern Ghana may expose children to STEC through household fecal contamination and foodborne routes. The lack of association between livestock risk factors and the more commonly detected pathogens, aEPEC and C. jejuni/coli, warrants further research, particularly to help explain how animal-keeping and sanitation practices affect transmission of fecal pathogens that were highly prevalent in chicken feces.	0
34864564	Variation and frequency of supernumerary teats, litter size, histological features and the fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) gene expression pattern in goats.	Historically, female domestic goats carrying multiple kids are mostly unable to express sufficient nursing ability due to a limited number of functional teats. Therefore, the functional teat is an important component in prolific goat breeding, and plays a key role in the future health of their kids. With this motivation, we wanted to investigate the phenotypic features, litter size, histology of adult female mammary glands, and the gene expression profile of the  fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) gene in goats. To illustrate this, the initial dataset of the current study consists of an electronic questionnaire that includes 697 individuals (548 does and 149 bucks) of five endemic and three exotic goats from 2015 to 2020 in different geographic areas of Iran, from 59 Markhoz (MARG), 50 Azari (AZAR), 73 Busheri (BUSH), 69 Sarbisheh (SARB), 165 Mahabadi (MOHA) indigenous goats and also exotic breeds, including 183 Saanen (SANN), 39 Alpine (ALPN), and 59 Boer (BORE) goats. The results of this study confirmed that MOHA goats (4.16%), BORE (4.43%) and SANN goat breeds (5.75%) have larger litter sizes. Interestingly, the evidence gathering when SNTs occurred showed that both the BUSH and BORE goat breeds had the highest frequency of SNTs. Moreover, under the same physiological and lactation conditions, there was no statistically significant difference in histological features between the three compared does class consist of the two teats, SNTs, and four functional teats. In addition, the results of the gene expression profile significantly highlight the  FGF-2 gene pattern in two teat groups compared to other SNT groups (P < 0.01). In summary, this scenario can be used to generate further research and facts on responsible candidate genes, the variations in teat numbers in goats, examining both the incidence of SNT and litter size.	0
35255833	The fiber diameter traits of Tibetan cashmere goats are governed by the inherent  differences in stress, hypoxic, and metabolic adaptations: an integrative study of proteome and transcriptome.	BACKGROUND: Tibetan cashmere goats are served as a valuable model for high altitude adaptation and hypoxia complications related studies, while the cashmere produced by these goats is an important source of income for the herders. The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in protein abundance underlying  the fine (average 12.20 ± 0.03 μm of mean fiber diameter) and coarse cashmere (average 14.67 ± 0.05 μm of mean fiber diameter) producing by Tibetan cashmere goats. We systematically investigated the genetic determinants of fiber diameter  by integrated analysis with proteomic and transcriptomic datasets from skin tissues of Tibetan cashmere goats. RESULTS: We identified 1980 proteins using a label-free proteomics approach. They were annotated to three different databases, while 1730 proteins were mapped to the original protein coding genes (PCGs) of the transcriptomic study. Comparative analyses of cashmere with extremely fine vs. coarse phenotypes yielded 29 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), for instance, APOH, GANAB, AEBP1, CP, CPB2, GPR142, VTN, IMPA1, CTSZ, GLB1, and HMCN1. Functional enrichment analysis of these DEPs revealed their involvement in oxidation-reduction process, cell redox homeostasis, metabolic, PI3K-Akt, MAPK, and Wnt signaling pathways. Transcription factors enrichment analysis revealed the proteins mainly belong to  NF-YB family, HMG family, CSD family. We further validated the protein abundance  of four DEPs (GC, VTN, AEBP1, and GPR142) through western blot, and considered they were the most potential candidate genes for cashmere traits in Tibetan cashmere goats. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses indicated that the major biological variations underlying the difference of cashmere fiber diameter in Tibetan cashmere goats were attributed to the inherent adaptations related to metabolic, hypoxic, and stress response differences. This study provided novel insights into the breeding strategies for cashmere traits and enhance the understanding of the biological and genetic mechanisms of cashmere traits in Tibetan cashmere goats.	0
34689003	Tracking tick-borne diseases in Mongolian livestock using next generation sequencing (NGS).	The livestock industry in Mongolia accounts for 24% of national revenue, with one third of the population maintaining a pastoral lifestyle. This close connection between Mongolian population and livestock is a major concern for pathogen transfer, especially given the increase in vector-borne diseases globally. This study examines blood samples from livestock to assess the prevalence of tick-borne bacterial infections across three provinces in Mongolia (Dornogovi, Selenge, Töv). Whole blood samples from 243 livestock (cattle=38, camel=11, goat=85, horse=22, sheep=87) were analyzed with 16S metagenomics next-generation  sequencing (NGS) to screen for bacterial pathogens. Positive-NGS samples for Anaplasma, Bartonella, Ehrlichia, Francisella, Leptospira, and Rickettsia were confirmed by conventional PCR and DNA sequencing. Prevalence rates of Anaplasma,  Bartonella, and Ehrlichia were 57.6%, 12.8%, and 0.4%, respectively. A significant difference in the prevalence of Anaplasma spp. in livestock by province was observed, with a higher prevalence in Selenge (74.2%, p<0.001) and Töv (64.2% p = 0.006) compared to the semi-arid region of Dornogovi (39.8%). In contrast, no association was observed in Bartonella prevalence by provinces. All  Anaplasma sequences (N = 139) were characterized as A. ovis. For Bartonella species characterization, phylogenetic analyses of gltA and rpoB genes identified three Bartonella species including B. bovis, B. melophagi and Candidatus B. ovis. Bartonella bovis was detected in all 22-positive cattle, while B. melophagi and Candidatus B. ovis were found in four and three sheep, respectively. This study identifies a high prevalence of tick-borne pathogens within the livestock population and to our knowledge, is the first time NGS methods have been used to  explore tick-borne diseases in Mongolia. Further research is needed in Mongolia to better understand the clinical and economic burdens associated with tick-borne diseases in both livestock and pastoral herder populations.	0
34359260	Screening Candidate Genes Regulating Placental Development from Trophoblast Transcriptome at Early Pregnancy in Dazu Black Goats (Capra hircus).	This study explored the trophoblast transcriptome to understand potential functional genes involved in early placental development in goats and their enriched signaling pathways. Trophoblast samples were collected from nine Dazu Black goats on days 20, 25, and 30 of pregnancy (D20, D25, and D30). As the pregnancy progressed, the morphology and histological structures showed significant growth, adhesion, and angiogenesis. A total of 23,253 commonly expressed genes (CEGs) and 4439 differently expressed genes (DEGs) were detected  by RNA sequencing. The common highly expressed genes (ChEGs) (the top 100 CEGs) with the highest FPKM percentage (29.9%) of all CEGs were annotated to the ribosome pathway and maintain pregnancy. DEGs were abundant in D30 vs. D20 (3715  DEGs). Besides, the DEGs were associated with the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation and activation of PI3K-Akt, focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction, Rap1, and CAM signaling pathways. The RAP1 may be a central pathway  since it coordinates with others to regulate the cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and fusion of trophoblasts. qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis confirmed the transcriptional expression in IGF1, VEGFC, RAPGEF3, PIK3CA, AKT3, ITGB3, ITGA11, SPP1, NOS1, and ATP6V0B genes and protein levels in VEGF, RAPGEF3, and Akt. This is the first study of transcriptome profiling in goat placenta and  provides diverse genetic resources for further research on placenta development.	0
35158542	Evaluation of Maternal Genetic Background of Two Hungarian Autochthonous Sheep Breeds Coming from Different Geographical Directions.	The aim of our research was the evaluation of the maternal genetic background of  two Hungarian autochthonous sheep breeds of different geographical origin. A major argument for the preservation of endangered animal breeds is their documented past and historical importance. These also include the registration of pedigree data. This is the first study to evaluate and compare Tsigai and Cikta sheep in Hungary. Our investigation is based on two complete sequences of mitochondrial DNA (cytochrome b gene and control region). Our research was performed on these two sheep breeds with markedly different breed histories and breed characteristics to determine a possible common maternal genetic background, as ultimately the origin of both breeds can be traced back to Asia Minor. Between 2015 and 2017, a total of 203 biological samples were taken using a newly introduced founder sampling method. We found that the prevailing haplogroup B accounted for over 80% of both breeds, strengthening the common ancestral root. However, the pairwise genetic differentiation estimates (KST) calculated using the sequence-based statistics for cytochrome b gene and control region were 0.034 and 0.021, respectively (both at level p < 0.05); thus, revealing genetic differentiation in both sequences between the Tsigai and Cikta. We note that the  known different history of the breeds is clearly justified by the currently studied deviations in their maternal genetic background.	0
34818866	Serosurvey of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus in livestock, Kohgiluyeh and  Boyer-Ahmad, Iran, 2017.	BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne viral zoonosis with up to 50% mortality rate in humans. In addition to the role of animals in the transmission of the virus and spread of infected ticks through  livestock trade, they can be employed as sentinel hosts for monitoring the infection. Iran is one of the endemic counties for CCHF and the disease has been  documented in all provinces. However, in some provinces such as Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, the rate of the disease has been dramatically low. Therefore, this serosurvey was designed to investigate CCHF virus (CCHFV) seroprevalence among livestock in different parts of Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province. METHODS: This study was conducted in 2017, in which, blood samples were collected from 501 sheep and goats from eight different cities of Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province. CCHFV IgG antibodies were detected in livestock serum samples by specific ELISA assays for detection of ovine and caprine antibodies. RESULTS: In total, four sheep serum of out of 501 (0.8%) livestock samples (3 from Gachsaran and 1 from Dena) had CCHFV IgG antibodies. No significant association was found between CCHFV seropositivity and sex or age of animals (P>0.05). INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a minor CCHFV circulation in Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province, Iran. However, due to the notion that outbreaks of tick-borne infections is hard to predict; steady and comprehensive monitoring programs especially in ticks and animals would be critical for understanding the circulation on the pathogen in a region.	0
34338946	Seroprevalence of Spotted Fever Group Rickettsiae in extensively managed sheep and goats in Nigeria, West Africa.	Sheep and goats raised extensively are frequently infested by Ixodid ticks that may act as vectors or reservoirs of Spotted Fever Group Rickettsiae (SFGR). A study to determine the seroprevalence of SFGR infection in 300 sheep and goats in Plateau State, Nigeria was conducted from September to November, 2018 using the Indirect Fluorescence Antibody Test (IFAT). Overall, 85 out of 300 animals (28.3%) were seropositive to SFGR. Relatively higher seroprevalence was recorded  in sheep than goats (28.8% vs 28.0%) but the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Furthermore, seropositivity was not affected by age, sex  or location of the animals screened in this study. This is the first serological  study to report the prevalence of SFGR in sheep and goats using IFAT in this study area. The presence of SFGR antibodies in domestic ruminants is of public health concern considering the close association between farmers and their animals occasioned by the management system practiced in the study area. This finding calls for further studies to evaluate the level of human exposure to this group of pathogen.	0
34490978	Solid diet manipulates rumen epithelial microbiota and its interactions with host transcriptomic in young ruminants.	Solid diet supplementation in the early life stages of ruminants could improve rumen microbiota and tissue development. However, most studies focus on bacteria  in the rumen content community. The microbiota attached on rumen epithelium are rarely investigated, and their correlations with rumen content bacteria and host  transcripts are unknown. In this study, rumen digesta attached in the epithelium  from goats in three diet regimes (milk replacer only, milk replacer supplemented  concentrate and milk replacer supplemented concentrate plus alfalfa pellets) were collected for measurement of the epithelial microbiota using next generation sequencing. Correspondingly, the rumen tissues of the same animals were measured  with the host transcriptome. The distinct microbial structures and compositions between rumen content and epithelial communities were associated with solid diet  supplementation. Regarding rumen development in pre-weaning ruminants, a solid diet, especially its accompanying neutral detergent fibre nutrients, was the most significant driver that influenced the rumen microbiota and epithelium gene expression. Compared with content bacteria, rumen epithelial microbiota had a stronger association with the host transcriptome. The host transcriptome correlated with host phenotypes were associated with rumen epithelial microbiota  and solid diet. This study reveals that the epithelial microbiota is crucial for  proper rumen development, and solid diet could improve rumen development through  both the rumen content and epithelial microbiota.	0
34790713	Hypothalamic Transcriptome Analysis Reveals the Crucial MicroRNAs and mRNAs Affecting Litter Size in Goats.	The hypothalamus was the coordination center of the endocrine system, which played an important role in goat reproduction. However, the molecular mechanism of hypothalamus regulating litter size in goats was still poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the key functional genes associated with prolificacy by hypothalamus transcriptome analysis of goats. In this research, an integrated analysis of microRNAs (miRNAs)-mRNA was conducted using the hypothalamic tissue of Yunshang black goats in the follicular stage. A total of 72,220 transcripts were detected in RNA-seq. Besides, 1,836 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between high fecundity goats at the follicular phase (FP-HY) and  low fecundity goats at the follicular phase (FP-LY). DEGs were significantly enriched in 71 Gene Ontology (GO) terms and 8 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. The transcriptome data suggested that DEGs such as BMPR1B, FGFR1, IGF1 and CREB1 are directly or indirectly involved in many processes like hypothalamic gonadal hormone secretion. The miRNA-seq identified 1,837 miRNAs, of which 28 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs). These DEMs may  affect the nerve cells survival of goat hypothalamic regulating the function of target genes and further affect the hormone secretion activities related to reproduction. They were enriched in prolactin signaling pathway, Jak-STAT signaling pathway and GnRH signaling pathway, as well as various metabolic pathways. Integrated analysis of DEMs and DEGs showed that 87 DEGs were potential target genes of 28 DEMs. After constructing a miRNA-mRNA pathway network, we identified several mRNA-miRNAs pairs by functional enrichment analysis, which was involved in hypothalamic nerve apoptosis. For example, NTRK3 was co-regulated by  Novel-1187 and Novel-566, as well as another target PPP1R13L regulated by Novel-566. These results indicated that these key genes and miRNAs may play an important role in the development of goat hypothalamus and represent candidate targets for further research. This study provides a basis for further explanation of the basic molecular mechanism of hypothalamus, but also provides a new idea for a comprehensive understanding of prolificacy characteristics in Yunshang black goats.	0
34514755	Insertion/deletion variants within the IGF2BP2 gene identified in reported genome-wide selective sweep analysis reveal a correlation with goat litter size.	Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2, also called IMP2) plays an essential role in the development and maturation of germ cells and embryos and is a candidate gene for goat litter size, based on a previous genome-wide selective sweep analysis. In this study, the mRNA expression level of IGF2BP2 was found to be significantly higher in a single-lamb group than in a multi-lamb group. Insertions/deletions (indels) within the goat IGF2BP2 gene, including P4-Ins-13bp and P5-Del-12bp, were verified in 918 Shaanbei White Cashmere (SBWC) female goats. The minor allelic frequencies (MAFs) of P4-Ins-13bp and P5-Del-12bp loci were 0.349 and 0.295, respectively. Analysis using the Chi-square (χ2) test showed that the genotype (χ2=14.479, P=0.006) distribution of P4-Ins-13bp was significantly different between the single-lamb and multi-lamb groups. Correlation analysis demonstrated that P4-Ins-13bp was significantly associated with goat litter size (P=0.022), and individual goats with the homozygous deletion/deletion (DD) genotype produced more litters than other goats. Therefore, considered as a potential molecular marker significantly related to lambing traits, the P4-Ins-13bp mutation of the goat IGF2BP2 gene can  be used in goat breeding with practical molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS) to optimize female reproduction and improve economic efficiency in the goat industry.	0
34530508	Genetic variants of the growth differentiation factor 8 affect body conformation  traits in Chinese Dabieshan cattle.	OBJECTIVE: The growth differentiation factor 8 (GDF8) gene plays a key role in bone formation, resorption, and skeletal muscle development in mammals. Here, we  studied the genetic variants of GDF8 and their contribution to body conformation  traits in Chinese Dabieshan cattle. METHODS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the bovine GDF8 gene by DNA sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis, motif analysis, and genetic diversity analysis were conducted using bioinformatics software. Association analysis between five SNPs, haplotype combinations, and body conformation traits  was conducted in 380 individuals. RESULTS: The GDF8 was highly conserved in seven species, and the GDF8 sequence of cattle was most similar to the sequences of sheep and goat based on the phylogenetic analysis. The motif analysis showed that there were 12 significant motifs in GDF8. Genetic diversity analysis indicated that the polymorphism information content of the five studied SNPs was within 0.25 to 0.5. Haplotype analysis revealed a total of 12 different haplotypes and those with a frequency of <0.05 were excluded. Linkage disequilibrium analysis showed a strong linkage (r2>0.330) between the following SNPs: g.5070C>A, g.5076T>C, and g.5148A>C. Association analysis indicated these five SNPs were associated with some of the body conformation traits (p<0.05), and the animals with haplotype combination H1H1 (-GGGG CCTTAA-) had greater wither height, hip height, heart girth, abdominal girth, and pin bone width than the other (p<0.05) Dabieshan cattle. CONCLUSION: Overall, our results indicate that the genetic variants of GDF8 affected the body conformation traits of Chinese Dabieshan cattle, and the GDF8 gene could make a strong candidate gene in Dabieshan cattle breeding programs.	0
34365125	Seroprevalence of pestivirus infections is low in Belgian small ruminant flocks and is significantly associated with the presence of cattle.	A study was implemented to estimate the pestivirus seroprevalence in sheep and goats in Belgium, to identify circulating species and to check for a potential association between seropositivity of small ruminants and presence of cattle in the same farm. It was based on the testing of serum samples and bulk tank milk samples (BTM) collected in sheep and goat flocks in 2018-2019 all over the country. 7460 serum samples collected from 410 flocks were tested by a commercial ELISA able to detect antibodies (Ab) against Border Disease Virus (BDV), and Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV). BTM samples (n = 144) were collected from dairy flocks in November 2019 and tested with the same Ab ELISA. ELISA positive serum samples were also tested by virus neutralization test (VNT) for neutralizing antibodies against BDV, BVDV-type1 and BVDV-type2. Virological tests (RT-PCR) were performed on pools of serum samples from pestivirus-exposed flocks  with at least two seropositive animals and on all Antibody-positive BTM samples.  Information about serum and milk samples (identification, test results, farm of origin and location, presence of cattle) were gathered in animal-level and farm-level databases. Based on this study, the apparent animal seroprevalence for pestiviruses in small ruminant flocks in Belgium in 2018 was estimated to be 0.87 % (95 % C.I. [0.68 %-1.11 %]). The prevalence of flocks exposed to pestivirus (i.e. with at least one seropositive animal) was estimated to be 8.5 % (95 % C.I. [6.4 % - 11.6 %]). In exposed flocks, the average within-flock seroprevalence was 9.9 %. In dairy sheep and goats, the estimated proportion of exposed flocks in 2019, based on the detection of pestivirus antibodies in the bulk tank milk, was  9.7 % [5.9 %-15.7 %]. All PCR tests were negative, indicating the likely absence  of active pestivirus circulation in these flocks. Although the observed pestivirus seroprevalence was found to be low in Belgian small ruminants, this study also showed, based on VNT results, that they are exposed to several pestivirus species: BDV, BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. 22.4 % of the farms included in the serological survey were holding both a small ruminant flock and a cattle herd, hence with a potential risk of contact between the two species. There was a significant positive association between pestivirus seropositivity in the sheep/goat flocks and the presence of a cattle herd in the same farm (OR = 2.42 (95 %C.I. [1.18-4.94]) but this association was not found for Ab-positive BTM in  dairy flocks.	0
34424814	Investigation of Genetic Effects of Nucleotide Variants Within the Goat PRNT Gene on Growth Performance.	Our previous study has firstly pointed that three nucleotide variants (g.-11C > T, g.117A > G, and g.149C > T) of the goat PRNT gene can significantly  influence litter size. Given litter size is positively correlated with growth performance, we consider whether the PRNT gene also acts on the growth performance in goats. In this work, a correlation analysis among different litter size types and growth traits of Shaanbei white cashmere (SBWC) goats was performed, and results showed that a positive correlation did exist in our detected population (P < 0.01). Then, the association among different genotypes of three variations and goat growth performance was measured. Our results pointed to g.117A > G being significantly associated with the cannon circumference (P = 4.60E-05) while no significant effect was found between another two SNPs and growth traits after the Bonferroni's correction (P*n < 0.05). Together, this is the first report about the influence of the PRNT gene on the growth of goat and g.117A > G can be regarded as a possible DNA marker applying for MAS breeding.	0
34609690	Detection of whole genome selection signatures of Pakistani Teddy goat.	BACKGROUND: Natural and artificial selection tend to cause variability that contributes to shape the genome of livestock in a way that differentiates them among the animal kingdom. The particular aim here is to identify positive selection signatures with whole genome pooled-sequence data of Pakistani Teddy goat. METHODS AND RESULTS: Paired-end alignment of 635,357,043 reads of Teddy goat with (ARS1) reference genome assembly was carried out. Pooled-Heterozygosity (Hp) and  Tajima's D (TD) are applied for validation and getting better hits of selection signals, while pairwise FST statistics is conducted on Teddy vs. Bezoar (wild goat ancestor) for genomic differentiation, moreover annotation of regions under  positive selection was also performed. Hp score with - ZHp > 5 detected six windows having highest hits on Chr. 29, 9, 25, 15 and 14 that harbor HRASLS5, LACE1 and AXIN1 genes which are candidate for embryonic development, lactation and body height. Secondly, - ZTD value of > 3.3 showed 4 windows with very strong hits on Chr.5 & 9 which harbor STIM1 and ADM genes related to body mass and weight. Lastly, - ZFST < - 5 generated four strong signals on Chr.5 & 12 harbor LOC102183233 gene. Other significant selection signatures encompass genes associated with wool production, prolificacy and coat colors traits in this breed. CONCLUSIONS: In brief, this study identified the genes under selection in Pakistani Teddy goat that will be helpful to refining the marker-assisted breeding policies and converging required production traits within and across other goat breeds and to explore full genetic potential of this valued species of livestock.	0
34206774	Genetic Selection for Resistance to Gastrointestinal Parasitism in Meat Goats and Hair Sheep through a Performance Test with Artificial Infection of Haemonchus contortus.	Internal parasitism has been the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in small ruminants in many areas such as the southcentral USA. Among the different approaches and management practices to cope with internal parasitism, genetic selection for internal parasite resistance is recognized as one with considerable potential long-term impact. A central performance test with artificial infection  of Haemonchus contortus for selection of growing meat goats and hair sheep for breeding to increase resistance to internal parasitism and on-farm selection of females was conducted for 3 years. The results varied considerably among breeds of goats and flocks of sheep. Spanish goats and St. Croix sheep maintained relatively low fecal egg count (FEC) each year, whereas for goats categorized as  being of high resistance and Dorper sheep FEC decreased with advancing year. Packed call volume (PCV) and total serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels were not strongly related to FEC. Genetic parameters varied between the two species, which might be related to previous selection pressure exerted for parasite resistance.  Heritability of FEC was higher in goats than sheep. The genetic correlation between FEC and IgM and IgG was negative for both species, which suggests possible genetic association. Genetic and phenotypic correlations between ADG and FEC were nonsignificant for both species. In conclusion, different relationships  of FEC and PCV between species require careful attention during selection and the lack of relationship between ADG and FEC suggests that selection of growing male  meat goats and hair sheep for resistance to internal parasitism will not adversely affect growth performance.	0
34749158	Cross-sectional survey for sheep leptospirosis in the northeast region of Brazil.	Sheep farming has shown expressive growth, even in the Northeast region of Brazil, with rainfall below expectations in the last decade. This growth has been observed not only in the number of herds, but also in the number of properties involved in sheep farming. Although expressive, the production of small ruminants still presents low levels of performance, mainly due to the occurrence of diseases, which constitute an obstacle to this activity. The aim of this study was to determine the factors associated with the seroprevalence of leptospirosis  in sheep in Northeastern Brazil. Blood samples were collected from 3438 sheep in  190 herds from 48 municipalities, belonging to the states of Ceará, Paraíba, Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe. Serological diagnosis was performed using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). In 76.3 % (95 % CI = 69.79-81.81) of the herds there was at least one animal seropositive for at least one of the Leptospira spp. serogroups and 14.94 % (95 %CI = 13.8-16.18) of the animals were  seropositive. The state of Paraíba had the highest herd (95.7 %) and animal (26.6 %) prevalences, followed by Ceará (93.9 % and 23.7 %, respectively). The most frequent serogroups were Autumnalis (18.68 %), Australis (17.9 %) and Pyrogenes (15.18 %). There was no association between the studied variables and the herd-level prevalence of leptospirosis. High herd and animal-level seroprevalences was found for sheep leptospirosis in the semiarid region of Northeastern Brazil, and there is a need to implement control and prevention measures, such as quarantine, serology, vaccination and adequate treatment, in addition to the introduction of proven healthy animals, mainly in the states of Paraíba and Ceará, aiming to reduce the prevalence of disease.	0
34683352	Goat Paratuberculosis: Experimental Model for the Evaluation of Mycobacterium Persistence in Raw Milk Cheese.	"Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the causative agent of chronic proliferative enteritis found in ruminants, known as paratuberculosis (PTB). The spread of PTB is increasing in countries with advanced animal husbandry practices, leading to significant economic losses. Moreover, a supposed zoonotic role of MAP in Crohn's disease (CD) in humans has been discussed by the  scientific community; however, although the association between MAP and CD has generally been accepted, it is still up for debate if MAP is the main cause of CD, a contributing factor, or merely a commensal organism for the development of  CD. The aim of this study was to assess the survival of MAP during the entire production process of a traditional Italian goat's raw milk fresh cheese, the ""Robiola di Roccaverano"", assessing the survival rate and persistence of MAP in the final product. A mix of MAP field isolates from goats of the Roccaverano area and a reference ATCC strain were used to carry out milk in experimental inoculation. Samples of milk, curd and cheese were taken in two consecutive batches of production. Microbiological challenge tests, evaluated by f57-qPCR, showed a significant decrease in MAP charge during the cheesemaking process for both batches, suggesting the productive process has an impact on MAP survival."	0
35094463	Incidence and molecular characterization of ESBL-producing and colistin-resistant Escherichia coli isolates recovered from healthy food-producing animals in Pakistan.	OBJECTIVES: To investigate the occurrence and molecular features of ESBL-producing and colistin-resistant Escherichia coli isolates recovered from healthy food-producing animals in Pakistan. METHODS: A total of 153 E. coli isolates were recovered from 250 faecal samples collected from livestock and poultry. The antibiotic susceptibility, resistant determinants and mobile genetic elements were determined for all the isolates. The clonal relatedness was analysed by MLST. Plasmids harbouring, localization and transferability of mcr-1 gene were carried out by Southern hybridization, S1-PFGE and transconjugation. RESULTS: Out of 153 E. coli strains, 49.01% isolates were ESBLs producers, whereas 18.95% were resistant to colistin and 84.31% of the isolates. Multidrug resistance was found in 84% of the isolates. The ESBL-producing E. coli in buffaloes, cattle, sheep, goat and broilers faecal samples were 60%, 74%, 54%, 50% and 68%, respectively. Among the ESBLs genes, blaCTX-M was the most prevalent group detected in 98.66%, while only mcr-1 of the colistin-resistant genes could  be PCR amplified in 29 isolates. The common MGEs found were ISECP1 (35.13%), ISCR1 (33.78%), ISApl1 (20.27%) and Inti1 (58.10%). The most predominant Inc. types found were IncFIB 46.66%, followed by IncFIA 30.66%, IncFIC 26.66%, IncFrepB 26.66%, IncHI2 26.66%, IncP 22.66% and IncX4 21.33%. The most frequent sequence type detected was ST58. Southern blot and S1-PFGE confirmed the plasmid  harbouring of mcr-1 gene. CONCLUSION: The co-occurrence of mcr-1 and ESBLs-encoding genes, along with MGEs  in E. coli from healthy food animals in Pakistan, is a major concern. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: Antimicrobial resistance can be transferred from animals to humans by direct contact or via the food chain and environment. The prevalence and co-occurrence of ESBL and colistin resistance genes from food-producing animals is rare in Pakistan. To our knowledge, this is the first report to find ESBLs and mcr-1-harbouring E. coli from the faecal samples of the  healthy food-producing animals in Pakistan. The presence of ARGs in association with MGEs, co-harbouring the virulence factors, as determined in the current study, is a severe threat to livestock and the human community as it has horizontally and food web transferability.	0
34399299	Long term immunity against Peste Des Petits Ruminants mediated by a recombinant Newcastle disease virus vaccine.	Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) is a highly contagious and often fatal disease of sheep and goats. Conventional live vaccines have been successfully used in endemic countries however, there are not completely safe and not allowing differentiation between vaccinated and infected animals (DIVA). In this study, a  recombinant Newcastle disease virus (NDV) expressing the hemagglutinin of PPRV (NDV-PPRVH) was evaluated on small ruminants by serology response in sheep and goats, experimental infection in goats and immunity duration in sheep. The NDV-PPRVH vaccine injected twice at 28 days' interval, provided full protection against challenge with a virulent PPR strain in the most sensitive species and induced significant neutralizing antibodies. Immunological response in goats was  slightly higher than sheep and the vaccine injected at 108.0 50 % egg infective dose/mL allowed anti-PPRV antibodies that lasted at least 12 months as shown by antibody response monitoring in sheep. The NDV vector presented a limited replication in the host and vaccinated animals remained negative when tested by cELISA based on PPRV nucleoprotein allowing DIVA. This recombinant vaccine appears to be a promising candidate in a free at risk countries and may be an important component of the global strategy for PPR eradication.	0
34193038	Insertion of an endogenous Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus element into the BCO2 - gene abolishes its function and leads to yellow discoloration of adipose tissue in Norwegian Spælsau (Ovis aries).	BACKGROUND: The accumulation of carotenoids in adipose tissue leading to yellow fat is, in sheep, a heritable recessive trait that can be attributed to a nonsense mutation in the beta-carotene oxygenase 2 (BCO2) gene. However, not all  sheep breeds suffering from yellow fat have this nonsense mutation, meaning that  other functional mechanisms must exist. We investigated one such breed, the Norwegian spælsau. RESULTS: In spælsau we detected an aberration in BCO2 mRNA. Nanopore sequencing of genomic DNA revealed the insertion of a 7.9 kb endogenous Jaagsiekte Sheep Retrovirus (enJSRV) sequence in the first intron of the BCO2 gene. Close examination of its cDNA revealed that the BCO2 genes first exon was spliced together with enJSRV-sequence immediately downstream of a potential -AG splice acceptor site at enJSRV position 415. The hybrid protein product consists of 29 amino acids coded by the BCO2 exon 1, one amino acid coded by the junction sequence, followed by 28 amino acids arbitrary coded for by the enJSRV-sequence,  before a translation stop codon is reached. CONCLUSIONS: Considering that the functional BCO2 protein consists of 575 amino acids, it is unlikely that the 58 amino acid BCO2/enJSRV hybrid protein can display any enzymatic function. The existence of this novel BCO2 allele represents an alternative functional mechanism accounting for BCO2 inactivation and is a perfect example of the potential benefits for searching for structural variants using long-read sequencing data.	0
34783220	Cathepsin D knockdown regulates biological behaviors of granulosa cells and affects litter size traits in goats.	Cathepsin D (CTSD), the major lysosomal aspartic protease that is widely expressed in different tissues, potentially regulates the biological behaviors of various cells. Follicular granulosa cells are responsive to the increase of ovulation number, hence indirectly influencing litter size. However, the mechanism underlying the effect of CTSD on the behaviors of goat granulosa cells  has not been fully elucidated. This study used immunohistochemistry to analyze CTSD localization in goat ovarian tissues. Moreover, western blotting was applied to examine the differential expression of CTSD in the ovarian tissues of monotocous and polytocous goats. Subsequently, the effects of CTSD knockdown on cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and the expression of candidate genes  of the prolific traits, including bone morphogenetic protein receptor IB (BMPR-IB), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSHR), and inhibin α (INHA), were determined in granulosa cells. Results showed that CTSD was expressed in corpus luteum, follicle, and granulosa cells. Notably, CTSD expression in the monotocous group was significantly higher than that in the polytocous group. In addition, CTSD knockdown could improve granulosa cell proliferation, inhibit cell apoptosis, and significantly elevate the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), but it lowered the expression of Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) and caspase-3. Furthermore, CTSD knockdown significantly reduced the ratios of cells in the G0/G1 and G2/M phases but substantially increased the ratio of cells in the S phase. The expression levels of cyclin D2 and cyclin E were elevated followed by the obvious decline of cyclin A1 expression. However, the expression levels of BMPR-IB, FSHR, and INHA clearly increased as a result of CTSD knockdown. Hence, our findings demonstrate that CTSD is an important factor affecting the litter size trait in goats by regulating the granulosa cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and the expression of candidate genes of the prolific trait.	0
34673769	Minimalistic mycoplasmas harbor different functional toxin-antitoxin systems.	Mycoplasmas are minute bacteria controlled by very small genomes ranging from 0.6 to 1.4 Mbp. They encompass several important medical and veterinary pathogens that are often associated with a wide range of chronic diseases. The long persistence of mycoplasma cells in their hosts can exacerbate the spread of antimicrobial resistance observed for many species. However, the nature of the virulence factors driving this phenomenon in mycoplasmas is still unclear. Toxin-antitoxin systems (TA systems) are genetic elements widespread in many bacteria that were historically associated with bacterial persistence. Their presence on mycoplasma genomes has never been carefully assessed, especially for  pathogenic species. Here we investigated three candidate TA systems in M. mycoides subsp. capri encoding a (i) novel AAA-ATPase/subtilisin-like serine protease module, (ii) a putative AbiEii/AbiEi pair and (iii) a putative Fic/RelB  pair. We sequence analyzed fourteen genomes of M. mycoides subsp. capri and confirmed the presence of at least one TA module in each of them. Interestingly,  horizontal gene transfer signatures were also found in several genomic loci containing TA systems for several mycoplasma species. Transcriptomic and proteomic data confirmed differential expression profiles of these TA systems during mycoplasma growth in vitro. While the use of heterologous expression systems based on E. coli and B. subtilis showed clear limitations, the functionality and neutralization capacities of all three candidate TA systems were successfully confirmed using M. capricolum subsp. capricolum as a host. Additionally, M. capricolum subsp. capricolum was used to confirm the presence of functional TA system homologs in mycoplasmas of the Hominis and Pneumoniae phylogenetic groups. Finally, we showed that several of these M. mycoides subsp.  capri toxins tested in this study, and particularly the subtilisin-like serine protease, could be used to establish a kill switch in mycoplasmas for industrial  applications.	0
35203154	Investigation of Copy Number Variations (CNVs) of the Goat PPP3CA Gene and Their  Effect on Litter Size and Semen Quality.	Copy number variations (CNVs) have many forms of variation structure, and they play an important role in the research of variety diversity, biological evolution and disease correlation. Since CNVs have a greater impact on gene regulation and  expression, more studies are being finalized on CNVs in important livestock and poultry species. The protein phosphatase 3 catalytic subunit alpha (PPP3CA) is a  key candidate gene involved in the goat fecundity trait, and has important effects on precocious puberty, estrogen signal transduction pathways and oocyte meiosis. Additionally, PPP3CA also has a dephosphorylation effect in the process  of spermatogonial stem cell meiosis and spermatogenesis. So far, there is no research on the relationship between the copy number variations of the PPP3CA gene and reproduction traits. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the association between copy number variations in the goat PPP3CA gene  and litter size and semen quality in Shaanbei white cashmere goats (SBWC) (n = 353) and Guizhou Heima goats (n = 64). Based on the association analysis, the results showed that only CNV1 and CNV2 within the PPP3CA gene were distinctly related to the first-birth litter size in female goats (p = 7.6802 × 10-11; p = 5.0895 × 10-9, respectively) and they were also significantly associated with the semen quality of SBWC goats (p < 0.05). In addition, individuals with Loss genotypes demonstrated better phenotypic performance compared to those with other types. Therefore, CNV1 and CNV2 of the PPP3CA gene are potentially useful for breeding, as they are linked to important goat reproduction traits.	0
34267574	A Review on Human Orf: A Neglected Viral Zoonosis.	Orf virus (ORFV) is the etiologic agent of Orf or ecthyma contagiosum in humans but primarily affects different domestic and wild animals. The disease mostly affects sheep, goats and other small wild ruminants and spreads to humans through direct contact with infected animals or by way of contaminated fomites worldwide. ORFV is taxonomically classified as a member of the genus Parapoxvirus. It is known to have tolerance to inactivation in a drier environment, and it has been recovered from crusts after several months to years. Among immunocompetent people, the lesions usually resolve by its natural course within a maximum of 8 weeks. In immunosuppressed patients, however, it needs the use of various approaches including antiviral, immune modifier or minor surgical excisions. The  virus through its association with divergent host ranges helps to develop a mechanism to evade the immune system. The relative emergence of Orf, diagnosed on clinical ground among human cases, in unusual frequencies in southwest Ethiopia between October 2019 and May 2020, was the driver to write this review. The objective was to increase health care providers' diagnostic curiosity and to bring the attentiveness of public health advisors for prevention, control and the development of schemes for surveillance of Orf zoonosis in a similar setting like Ethiopia.	0
34359218	Exploration of Genetic Variants within the Goat A-Kinase Anchoring Protein 12 (AKAP12) Gene and Their Effects on Growth Traits.	The A-kinase anchoring protein 12 gene (AKAP12) is a scaffold protein, which can  target multiple signal transduction effectors, can promote mitosis and cytokinesis and plays an important role in the regulation of growth and development. In our previous study, P1-7 bp (intron 3) and P2-13 bp (3'UTR) indels within the AKAP12 gene significantly influenced AKAP12 gene expression. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the association between these two genetic variations and growth-related traits in Shaanbei white cashmere goats (SBWC) (n = 1405). Herein, we identified two non-linkage insertions/deletions (indels). Notably, we found that the P1-7 bp indel mutation was related to the height at hip cross (HHC; p < 0.05) and the P2-13 bp indel was associated with body weight, body length, chest depth, chest width, hip width, chest circumference and cannon  (bone) circumference in SBWC goats (p < 0.05). Overall, the two indels' mutations of AKAP12 affected growth traits in goats. Compared to the P1-7 bp indel, the P2-13 bp indel is more suitable for the breeding of goat growth traits.	0
34827869	Genome-Wide Identification of Reference Genes for Reverse-Transcription Quantitative PCR in Goat Rumen.	As the largest chamber of the ruminant stomach, the rumen not only serves as the  principal absorptive surface and nutrient transport pathway from the lumen into the animal, but also plays an important short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolic role in addition to protective functions. Accurate characterization of the gene expression profiles of genes of interest is essential to the exploration of the intrinsic regulatory mechanisms of rumen development in goats. Thus, the selection of suitable reference genes (RGs) is an important prerequisite for real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). In the present study, 16 candidate RGs were identified from our previous transcriptome sequencing of caprine rumen tissues. The quantitative expressions of the candidate RGs were measured using the RT-qPCR method, and the expression stability of the RGs was assessed using the geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper programs. GeNorm analysis showed that the M values were less than 0.5 for all the RGs except GAPT4, indicating that they were stably expressed in the rumen tissues throughout development. RPS4X and RPS6 were the two most stable RGs. Furthermore, the expressions of two randomly selected target genes (IGF1 and TOP2A), normalized by the selected most stable RGs (RPS4X and RPS6), were consistent with the results of RNA sequencing, while the use of GAPDH and ACTB as RGs resulted in altered profiles. Overall, RPS4X and RPS6 showed the  highest expression stability and the lowest coefficients of variation, and could  be used as the optimal reference combination for quantifying gene expression in rumen tissues via RT-qPCR analysis.	0
35327163	Hepatic Lipid Accumulation and Dysregulation Associate with Enhanced Reactive Oxygen Species and Pro-Inflammatory Cytokine in Low-Birth-Weight Goats.	Occurrence of low birth weight (LBW) is a major concern in livestock production,  resulting in poor postnatal growth, lowered efficiency of feed utilization, and impaired metabolic health in adult life. In the southwest region of China, birth  weight of indigenous strains of goats varies seasonally with lower weights in summer and winter, but the metabolic regulation of the LBW offspring is still unknown. In this study, by comparing LBW goats to normal birth weight group, we examined hepatic lipid content in association with regulatory mechanisms. Histological studies showed higher microvesicular morphology in the liver of LBW  goats in accompany with a significantly higher level of hepatic free fatty acids, total triglycerides, and cholesterols. Lipid metabolism impairment, increased oxidative stress, and inflammation were observed by transcriptome analysis. Meanwhile, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotation further demonstrated lipid peroxidation, antioxidant pathway, and pro-inflammatory response involved in the hepatic lipid dysregulation from LBW group. Therefore, dysregulations of hepatic lipid metabolism, including fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation, lipid transportation, and oxidative stress, played important roles to contribute the lipid accumulation in LBW goats. Moreover, due to impaired antioxidant capacity, the oxidative damage could interact with persisting pro-inflammatory responses, leading to a higher risk of liver injury and metabolic syndromes in their adult life.	0
34747679	Identification of differentially expressed genes associated with precocious puberty by suppression subtractive hybridization in goat pituitary tissues.	The aim of this study was to identify genes related to precocious puberty expressed in the pituitary of goats at different growth stages by suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH). The pituitary glands from Jining Gray (JG) goats (early puberty) and Liaoning Cashmere (LC) goats (late puberty) at 30, 90, and 180 days were used in this study. To identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the pituitary glands, mRNA was extracted from these tissues, and SSH libraries were constructed and divided into the following groups: juvenile group  (30-JG vs. 30-LC, API), puberty group (90-JG vs. 180-LC, BPI), and control group  (90-JG vs. 90-LC, EPI). A total of 60, 49, and 58 DEGs were annotated by 222 Gene Ontology (GO) terms and 75 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Most of the DEGs were significantly enriched in GO terms related to 'structural constituent of ribosome', 'translation' and 'GTP binding', and numerous DEGs were also significantly enriched in KEGG terms related to the Jak-STAT signaling and oocyte meiosis pathways. Candidate genes associated with precocious puberty and sexual development were screened from the SSH libraries. These genes were analyzed to determine if they were expressed in the pituitary tissues of the goats at different growth stages and to identify genes that may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. In this study, we found  precocious puberty-related genes (such as PRLP0, EIF5A, and YWHAH) that may be interesting from an evolutionary perspective and that could be investigated for use in future goat breeding programs. Our results provide a valuable dataset that will facilitate further research into the reproductive biology of goats.	0
